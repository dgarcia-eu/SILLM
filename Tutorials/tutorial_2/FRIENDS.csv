Monica, There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Joey, C'mon  you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Chandler, All right Joey  be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Phoebe, Wait  does he eat chalk?
Phoebe, Just  'cause  I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Monica, Okay  everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Chandler, Sounds like a date to me.
Chandler, Alright  so I'm back in high school  I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria  and I realize I am totally naked.
Chandler, Then I look down  and I realize there's a phone... there.
Joey, Instead of...?
Chandler, That's right.
Joey, Never had that dream.
Phoebe, No.
Chandler, All of a sudden  the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do  everybody starts looking at me.
Monica, And they weren't looking at you before?!
Chandler, Finally  I figure I'd better answer it  and it turns out it's my mother  which is very-very weird  because- she never calls me!
Ross,  Hi.
Joey, This guy says hello  I wanna kill myself.
Monica, Are you okay  sweetie?
Ross, I just feel like someone reached down my throat  grabbed my small intestine  pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Chandler, Cookie?
Monica,  Carol moved her stuff out today.
Joey, Ohh.
Monica,  Let me get you some coffee.
Ross, Thanks.
Phoebe, Ooh! Oh! 
Ross, No  no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No  just leave my aura alone  okay?
Phoebe, Fine!  Be murky!
Ross, I'll be fine  alright? Really  everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Monica, No you don't.
Ross, No I don't  to hell with her  she left me!
Joey, And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Ross, No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know  how should I know?
Chandler, Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
Ross, I told mom and dad last night  they seemed to take it pretty well.
Monica," Oh really  so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M.  ""I'll never have grandchildren  I'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  A wrong number?"
Ross, Sorry.
Joey, Alright Ross  look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Joey, Strip joint! C'mon  you're single! Have some hormones!
Ross, I don't want to be single  okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Chandler, And I just want a million dollars! 
Monica, Rachel?!
Rachel, Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are  you are!
Monica,  De-caff.  Okay  everybody  this is Rachel  another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody  this is Chandler  and Phoebe  and Joey  and- you remember my brother Ross?
Rachel, Hi  sure!
Ross, Hi.
Monica, So you wanna tell us now  or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Rachel, Oh God... well  it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents  and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out  and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know  I mean  I always knew looked familiar  but... Anyway  I just had to get out of there  and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this  and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go  and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart  but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Monica, Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Rachel, Ooh  I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... 
Monica, Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ  and she's really not happy about it.
Chandler,  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Ross,  I'll have whatever Christine is having.
Rachel,  Daddy  I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well  it matters to me!
Phoebe,  If I let go of my hair  my head will fall off.
Chandler,  Ooh  she should not be wearing those pants.
Joey, I say push her down the stairs.
Rachel, C'mon Daddy  listen to me! It's like  it's like  all of my life  everyone has always told me  'You're a shoe! You're a shoe  you're a shoe  you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said  'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse  y'know? Or a- or a hat! No  I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat  I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor  Daddy!
Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel, Look Daddy  it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica, Well  I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Rachel, Well  maybe that's my decision. Well  maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait  I said maybe!!
Monica, Just breathe  breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Phoebe,  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens   bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
Rachel, I'm all better now.
Phoebe,  I helped!
Monica, Okay  look  this is probably for the best  y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole  'hat' thing.
Joey,  And hey  you need anything  you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Monica, Joey  stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Joey, What  like there's a rule or something?
Chandler, Please don't do that again  it's a horrible sound.
Monica, Oh God  is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!
Joey, Who's Paul?
Ross, Paul the Wine Guy  Paul?
Monica, Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Ross, He finally asked you out?
Monica, Yes!
Chandler, Ooh  this is a Dear Diary moment.
Monica, Rach  wait  I can cancel...
Rachel, Please  no  go  that'd be fine!
Monica,  Are  are you okay? I mean  do you want me to stay?
Ross,  That'd be good...
Monica,  Really?
Ross,  No  go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Phoebe, What does that mean?   Does he sell it  drink it  or just complain a lot? 
Monica, Hi  come in! Paul  this is.. ... everybody  everybody  this is Paul.
Chandler, I'm sorry  I didn't catch your name. Paul  was it?
Monica, Okay  umm-umm  I'll just--I'll be right back  I just gotta go ah  go ah...
Ross, A wandering?
Monica, Change!  Okay  sit down.  Two seconds.
Phoebe, Ooh  I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Joey,  Hey  Paul!
Joey, Here's a little tip  she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Monica,  Shut up  Joey!
Ross, So Rachel  what're you  uh... what're you up to tonight?
Rachel, Well  I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon  so nothing!
Ross, Right  you're not even getting your honeymoon  God.. No  no  although  Aruba  this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway  if you don't feel like being alone tonight  Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Chandler,  Yes  and we're very excited about it.
Rachel, Well actually thanks  but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
Ross, Okay  sure.
Joey, Hey Pheebs  you wanna help?
Phoebe, Oh  I wish I could  but I don't want to.
Phoebe,  Love is sweet as summer showers  love is a wondrous work of art  but your love oh your love  your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la-  Thank you.  La-la-la-la...ohhh!
Ross,  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things  using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing  I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
Joey, I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Chandler, It's a beautiful thing.
Joey,  What's this?
Chandler, I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Joey, Which goes where?
Chandler, I have no idea.
Joey, Done with the bookcase!
Chandler, All finished!
Ross,  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can  I should have known.
Joey, Hey-hey-hey-hey  if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
Chandler, Yes  please don't spoil all this fun.
Joey, Ross  let me ask you a question. She got the furniture  the stereo  the good TV- what did you get?
Ross, You guys.
Chandler, Oh  God.
Joey, You got screwed.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Monica, Oh my God!
Monica, My brother's going through that right now  he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Monica, -leg?
Monica, You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was  I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
Monica, That's right. 
Rachel, Barry  I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on  but it isn't... it isn't  it's about me  and I ju-  Hi  machine cut me off again... anyway...look  look  I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel  but it isn't me  it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now  but you just have to give me a chance too... 
Ross, I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Joey, Shut up!
Chandler, You must stop! 
Ross, That only took me an hour.
Chandler, Look  Ross  you gotta understand  between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You  however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out  and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
Ross, You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody  y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case  there was only one woman- for her...
Joey, What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something  Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road  and Cookie Dough  and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies  or nuts  or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married  you were  like  what  eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Ross, I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Chandler, Stay out of my freezer! 
Monica, What?..... What  you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Monica, Oh  so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Monica, Yeah... yeah  I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Monica,  Oh God  oh God  I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Monica, I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Monica, Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Monica, ...Yeah. Yeah  I do.
Rachel, Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Ross,  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy  don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
Joey, Great story!  But  I uh  I gotta go  I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man  
Chandler, Angela's the screamer  Andrea has cats.
Joey, Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. 
Ross, Y'know  here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out ... who am I gonna ask? 
Rachel, Isn't this amazing? I mean  I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
Chandler, That is amazing.
Joey, Congratulations.
Rachel, Y'know  I figure if I can make coffee  there isn't anything I can't do.
Chandler, If can invade Poland  there isn't anything I can't do.
Joey, Listen  while you're on a roll  if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Monica,  Oh good  Lenny and Squigy are here.
Joey, Morning  Paul.
Rachel, Hello  Paul.
Chandler, Hi  Paul  is it?
Monica, Stop!
Monica, We'll talk later.
Joey, That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Monica, Shut up  and put my table back.
Chandler, All right  kids  I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers ... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Rachel, So  like  you guys all have jobs?
Monica, Yeah  we all have jobs. See  that's how we buy stuff.
Joey, Yeah  I'm an actor.
Rachel, Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
Joey, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Monica, Oh wait  wait  unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio  at the little theater in the park.
Joey, Look  it was a job all right?
Chandler, 'Look  Gippetto  I'm a real live boy.'
Joey, I will not take this abuse. 
Chandler," You're right  I'm sorry.  ""Once I was a wooden boy  a little wooden boy..."""
Joey, You should both know  that he's a dead man.  Oh  Chandler? 
Monica, So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Rachel, I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
Monica, I know  he's just so  so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Rachel, Oh  yeah.
Monica, Well  it's like that. With feelings.
Rachel, Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
Monica, Big time!
Rachel, Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
Monica, I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up  go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Rachel, Oh  look  wish me luck!
Monica, What for?
Rachel, I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.
Monica, Hey Frannie  welcome back! How was Florida?
Monica, How do you do that?
Monica, You know Paul?
Monica, You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Joey, Of course it was a line!
Monica, Why?! Why? Why  why would anybody do something like that?
Ross, I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Monica, I hate men!  I hate men!
Phoebe, Oh no  don't hate  you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Monica, Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Phoebe, All right  c'mere  gimme your feet. 
Monica, I just thought he was nice  y'know?
Joey,  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Rachel, Guess what?
Ross, You got a job?
Rachel, Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Chandler, And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel, You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale  fifty percent off!
Chandler, Oh  how well you know me...
Rachel, They're my new 'I don't need a job  I don't need my parents  I've got great boots' boots!
Monica, How'd you pay for them?
Rachel, Uh  credit card.
Monica, And who pays for that?
Rachel, Um... my... father.
Rachel, Oh God  come on you guys  is this really necessary?  I mean  I can stop charging anytime I want.
Monica, C'mon  you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Rachel, I know that. That's why I was getting married.
Phoebe, Give her a break  it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Rachel, Thank you.
Phoebe, You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison  and I got here  and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was  like  cleaning windshields outside port authority  and then he killed himself  and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me  I know exactly how you feel.
Ross, The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Monica, All right  you ready?
Rachel," No.  No  no  I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey  Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on  I can't do this!"
Monica, You can  I know you can!
Rachel, I don't think so.
Ross, Come on  you made coffee!   You can do anything! 
Ross, C'mon  cut. Cut  cut  cut ...
Rachel, Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Monica,  Rachel!  That was a library card!
Chandler,  Y'know  if you listen closely  you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Monica, Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Monica, Well  that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?
Ross, No. No  I gotta go home sometime.
Monica, You be okay?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Hey Mon  look what I just found on the floor.  What?
Monica, That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight  everybody.
Ross, Mmm.  Oh  no-
Rachel, Sorry-
Ross, No no no  go-
Rachel, No  you have it  really  I don't want it-
Ross, Split it?
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this  but back in high school  I had a  um  major crush on you.
Rachel, I knew.
Ross, You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Rachel, I did.
Ross, Oh. Listen  do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Rachel, Yeah  maybe...
Ross, Okay... okay  maybe I will...
Rachel, Goodnight.
Ross, Goodnight.
Monica, See ya.... Waitwait  what's with you?
Ross, I just grabbed a spoon. 
Joey, I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Phoebe,  I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Monica, What? I-I said you had a-
Phoebe,  What I said you had...
Monica,  Would you stop?
Phoebe, Oh  was I doing it again?
Monica, I said that you had a nice butt  it's just not a great butt.
Joey, Oh  you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
Ross, There's an image.
Rachel,  Would anybody like more coffee?
Chandler, Did you make it  or are you just serving it?
Rachel, I'm just serving it.
Chandler, Kids  new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. 
Rachel, Ugh.  Excuse me  could you give this to that guy over there?  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Okay  Las Vegas.
Chandler, Okay  so  I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Monica, What you guys don't understand is  for us  kissing is as important as any part of it.
Joey, Yeah  right!.......Y'serious?
Phoebe, Oh  yeah!
Rachel, Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Monica, Absolutely.
Chandler, Yeah  I think for us  kissing is pretty much like an opening act  y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Ross, Yeah  and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian  it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Chandler, The problem is  though  after the concert's over  no matter how great the show was  you girls are always looking for the comedian again  y'know? I mean  we're in the car  we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Rachel, Yeah  well  word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home  listening to that album alone.
Joey, ....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross, No  it's good  it is good  it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
Ross, Does she.
Ross, Marsha  these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee  that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
Ross,  No. No.
Ross, Okay  okay  yes  it is.  How about I'll  uh  catch up with you in the Ice Age.
Ross,Hi.
Ross, You look great. I  uh... I hate that.
Ross, Ah  well  in here  anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still  uh...
Ross, Well... you never know. How's  um.. how's the family?
Ross, Why- why are you here  Carol?
Ross, Pregnant?!
Chandler, Oh  I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Phoebe,...Then I've already seen this one! 
Monica,  Are you through with that?
Joey, Yeah  sorry  the swallowing slowed me down.
Monica, Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Chandler, Oh  uh  that would be mine. See  I wrote a note to myself  and then I realised I didn't need it  so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.
Phoebe, She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica  you know  you've already fluffed that-  -but  it's fine!
Monica, Look   I'm sorry  guys  I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Chandler, Yes  and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
Phoebe, Monica- Hi! Um  Monica  you're scaring me. I mean  you're like  you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Joey, Yeah  calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Monica, That's because as far as my parents are concerned  Ross can do no wrong. Y'see  he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Chandler,  Ew  ew  ew  ew ew ew ew ew!
Monica, What?
Chandler, Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
Rachel, Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Phoebe, Yeah  it's beautiful.
Rachel, Oh God  oh God  oh God oh God oh God oh God.... 
Phoebe, No  look  don't touch that!
Rachel, Oh  like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough  having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring  without the ring  which makes it so much harder...
Monica, Easy Rach  we'll find it.  Won't we!
Joey, Alright  when'd'ya have it on last?
Phoebe, Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
Chandler, You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
Rachel, I know I had it this morning  and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
Chandler, ...Dinah?
Rachel,  Ohhhhh  don't be mad...
Monica, You didn't.
Rachel, Oh  I am sorry...
Monica, I gave you one job! 
Rachel, Oh  but look how straight those noodles are!
Chandler, Now  Monica  you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
Monica,  I just... can't do it.
Chandler, Boys? We're going in.
Ross, .....Hi.
Monica, Wow. That is not a happy hi.
Ross, Carol's pregnant.
Phoebe,  Ooh! I found it!
Monica, W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Ross, Yeah. Do that for another two hours  you might be where I am right about now. 
Chandler, Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective  huh  Mon?
Rachel, Well now  how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Ross, Well  Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved  but if I'm not comfortable with it  I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Phoebe, She is so great! I miss her.
Monica, What does she mean by 'involved'?
Chandler, I mean presumably  the biggest part of your job is done.
Ross, Anyway  they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Rachel, So what are you gonna do?
Ross, I have no idea. No matter what I do  though  I'm still gonna be a father.
Joey, .....Well  this is still ruined  right?
Monica, Curry.
Ross, I- I think they're great! I  I really do.
Ross, Aw  Mom...
Monica, I'm sorry  why is this girl going to call me?
Monica, No Mom  I don't have a restaurant  I work in a restaurant.
Monica, Ross  could you come and help me with the spaghetti  please?
Ross, Yeah. 
Monica, I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish  but  were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
Monica, What's that supposed to mean?
Monica, No it's not.
Monica,  So  Ross  what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news  no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Ross,  Okay! Okay.  Look  I  uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me  and  so  well  here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child  and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
Joey, Your folks are really that bad  huh?
Ross, Well  y'know  these people are pros. They know what they're doing  they take their time  they get the job done.
Monica, Boy  I know they say you can't change your parents ... boy  if you could-  -I'd want yours.
Ross, Must pee. 
Phoebe, Y'know  it's even worse when you're twins.
Rachel, You're twins?
Phoebe, Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered  driven career type.
Chandler, What does she do?
Phoebe, She's a waitress.
Rachel, All right  you guys  I kinda gotta clean up now. 
Monica, Chandler  you're an only child  right? You don't have any of this.
Chandler, Well  no  although I did have an imaginary friend  who... my parents actually preferred.
Rachel, The lights  please..
Ross, ...How long was I in there?
Rachel, I'm just cleaning up.
Ross, D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
Rachel, Uh.. okay  sure! Thanks! 
Ross, Anyway.. um..  So  you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
Rachel, Oh.. a little..
Ross, Mm-hmm..
Rachel, A lot.
Ross, Mm.
Rachel, So  got any advice? Y'know  as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Ross, Well  you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this  this broken shell of a man  y'know  so you should try not to look too terrific  I know it'll be hard. Or  y'know  uh  hey!  I'll go down there  and I'll give Barry back his ring  and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Rachel, Oh  you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Ross, Got me.
Rachel, Remember when we were in high school together?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, I mean  didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone  fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?
Ross, Yes  yes!
Rachel, Oh! Man  I never thought I'd be here.. 
Ross, Me either... 
Ross,  Sorry I'm late  I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
Ross, How could I forget?
Ross,  Hello  Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So  uh  we're just waiting for...?
Ross, ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Ross, -she  of course  she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
Ross, Okay  that's great.  No  I'm- Oh.
Ross,  Quack  quack..
Rachel, Barry?
Rachel,  Are you sure?
Rachel, I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Rachel, I dumped him.
Ross, So  um- so how's this  uh  how's this gonna work? Y'know  with us? Y'know  when  like  important decisions have to be made?
Ross, Well  uh  uh  I don't know  okay  okay  how about with the  uh  with the baby's name?
Ross, Marlon?!
Ross, ...As in Mouse?
Ross, Still  you- you say Minnie  you hear Mouse. Um  how about  um.. how about Julia?
Ross, 'S'funny  um  uh  we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change  roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
Rachel, Oh  not much. I-I got a job.
Rachel, Why are- why are you so tanned?
Rachel, Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Rachel, Mindy?! My maid of honour  Mindy?!
Rachel, Oh! Well  um..  You've got plugs!
Rachel, And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Rachel, Okay..
Rachel, Wow.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Anyway  um   I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Ross, Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Ross, Thank you!
Ross, What  it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Ross, Well  wait a minute  wha- why is she in the title?
Ross, Oh  's'funny  really? Um  I don't remember you making any sperm.
Ross, No no no  she gets a credit  hey  I'm in there too.
Ross, Of course not  I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Ross, My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me  of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being  this is not my way- y'know what? Uh  um  this is too hard. I'm not  I can't do-
Ross, You- uh- y'know what  I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Ross, Oh my God.
Ross, Well? Isn't that amazing?
Joey, What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Chandler, I dunno  but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Phoebe, You know  if you tilt your head to the left  and relax your eyes  it kinda looks like an old potato.
Ross, Then don't do that  alright?
Phoebe, Okay!
Ross, Monica. Whaddya think?
Monica,  Mm-hmm.
Ross, Wh- are you welling up?
Monica, No.
Ross, You are  you're welling up.
Monica, Am not!
Ross, You're gonna be an aunt.
Monica,  Oh shut up!
Rachel,  Hi  Mindy. Hi  it-it's Rachel. Yeah  I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh  yeah  yeah he-he told me. No  no  it's okay. I hope you two are very happy  I really do. Oh  oh  and Mind  y'know  if-if everything works out  and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.   Okay  I know it was a cheap shot  but I feel so much better now.
Phoebe,  Hi guys!
Ross, Hey. Oh  oh  how'd it go?
Phoebe, Um  not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
Rachel, What? He said 'we should do it again'  that's good  right?
Monica, Uh  no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Rachel, Since when?
Joey, Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know  like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Chandler, Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Phoebe, Or  or  y'know  um  'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha  ha  I already am'.
Rachel, And everybody knows this?
Joey, Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Chandler, Yeah  it's like when you're a kid  and your parents put your dog to sleep  and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Ross, That's funny  that  no  because  uh  our parents actually did  uh  send our dog off to live on a farm.
Monica, Uh  Ross.
Ross, What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners  they had this unbelievable farm  they had horses  and  and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God  Chi Chi!
Chandler," ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
Joey," ""Warden  in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
Chandler, Hey  that was really good!
Joey, Thanks! Let's keep going.
Chandler," Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me  Damone  huh?"""
Joey," ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell  I can smoke."""
Chandler," ""Smoke away."""
Chandler, I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Joey, What?
Chandler, Relax your hand!
Chandler, Not so much!
Joey, Whoah!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Alright  now try taking a puff.
Chandler, Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Joey, No no no  I am not giving you a cigarette.
Chandler, It's fine  it's fine. Look  do you wanna get this part  or not? Here.
Chandler, Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it  you feel right. You feel complete.
Joey, Y'miss it?
Chandler, Nah  not so much. Alright  now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God. 
Monica, No  no  no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
Joey, That's ridiculous!
Ross, Can I use.. either thumb?
Rachel,  Alright  don't tell me  don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
Rachel,  Good for me!
Joey, Y'okay  Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah- no- I'm just- it's  I haven't worked- It's my bank.
Monica, What did they do to you?
Phoebe, It's nothing  it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail  and I open up their monthly  you know  STATEMENT-
Ross, Easy.
Phoebe, - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
Chandler, Oh  Satan's minions at work again...
Phoebe, Yes  'cause now I have to go down there  and deal with them.
Joey, What are you talking about? Keep it!
Phoebe, It's not mine  I didn't earn it  if I kept it  it would be like stealing.
Rachel, Yeah  but if you spent it  it would be like shopping!
Phoebe, Okay. Okay  let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear  with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy  okay  and  and skipping- 'Not-not-mine  not-not-mine  not-not-mine  not-not-mine'...
Monica, We're with you. We got it.
Phoebe, Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Rachel, Chandler  what are you doing?
Monica,  Hey. Whaddya doing?
Ross, What is this?!
Chandler, I'm smoking. I'm smoking  I'm smoking.
Phoebe, Oh  I can't believe you! You've been so good  for three years!
Chandler, And this- is my reward!
Ross, Hold on a second  alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Chandler, Okay  so this time I won't quit!
Chandler, All right! I'm putting it out  I'm putting it out. 
Phoebe, Oh  no! I- I can't drink this now!
Monica, Alright. I'm gonna go change  I've got a date.
Rachel, This Alan again? How's it goin'?
Monica, 'S'going pretty good  y'know? It's nice  and  we're having fun.
Joey, So when do we get to meet the guy?
Monica, Let's see  today's Monday... Never.
Monica, No. Not after what happened with Steve.
Chandler, What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Monica, Look  I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
Rachel, Well  then can we meet him?
Monica, Nope. Schhorry.
Monica, I mean  why should I let them meet him? I mean  I bring a guy home  and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean  they're like- coyotes  picking off the weak members of the herd.
Monica, I know. I just wish that once  I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Joey, Let it go  Ross.
Ross, Yeah  well  you didn't know Chi Chi.
Monica, Do you all promise?
Monica,  Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Joey, You can come in  but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Ross, Hey  Pheebs.
Phoebe, 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience  and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars  and a football phone!
Rachel, What bank is this?
Monica, Hey. It's him.  Who is it?
Joey,  Chandler! He's here!
Monica,  Okay  please be good  please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Monica, Hi. Alan  this is everybody. Everybody  this is Alan.
Monica,  Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.  Okay. Okay  let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot  hmm?
Monica, C'mon!
Ross, ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no  I'm sorry  I can't do this  can't do this. We loved him.
Monica, Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Rachel, And did you notice...? 
Joey, Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Phoebe, Yes  yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Ross, ...What shoe?
Phoebe, From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man  Who had a crooked smile  Who lived in a shoe  For a... while...'
Ross, ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Rachel, What future boyfriends? Nono  I th- I think this could be  y'know  it.
Monica, Really!
Chandler, Oh  yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties  right? 
Ross, You know what I like most about him  though?
Ross, The way he makes me feel about myself.
Monica, Hi.. how was the game?
Ross, Well..
Monica, Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Joey, Alan.
Ross, He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions  right  but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan  second base-Alan  third base-...
Rachel, I mean  it-it was like  it was like he made us into a team.
Chandler, Yep  we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Monica, Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Ross, What?
Monica, ..I dunno  a little too Alan?
Rachel, Well  no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Ross, Yeah  it's his  uh  innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
Chandler, I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Phoebe, Hey  Lizzie.
Phoebe, I brought you alphabet soup.
Phoebe," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause  y'know  ""sometimes y"". Uh  I also have something else for you. "
Phoebe, No  but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
Phoebe, I know.
Phoebe, No  I want you to have it. I don't want it.
Phoebe, Oh  that's fine  no.
Phoebe, No. 'Cause you need that. No  it's okay  thanks.
Phoebe, Okay  alright  you buy me a soda  and then we're even. Okay?
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, No  I'm fine.
Phoebe, Huh!
Ross, A thumb?!
Phoebe, I know! I know  I opened it up and there it was  just floating in there  like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
Chandler, Well  maybe it's a contest  y'know? Like  collect all five?
Phoebe, Does  um  anyone wanna see?
Rachel, It's worse than the thumb!
Chandler, Hey  this is so unfair!
Monica, Oh  why is it unfair?
Chandler, So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross  with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica  with that snort when she laughs? I mean  what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws  why can't you accept me for this?
Joey, ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Rachel, Well  I-I could live without it.
Joey, Well  is it  like  a little annoying  or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Ross, Oh  now  don't listen to him  Pheebs  I think it's endearing.
Joey," Oh   ""you do  do you""?"
Ross, You know  there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
Rachel," ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
Phoebe, Yeah  'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Rachel, Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out  and the gloves come on.
Monica, Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Monica, Okay.. Well  I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
Monica, Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean  they feel the thing  I don't feel the thing.
Monica, I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Monica, No  he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
Joey, Do you have any respect for your body?
Ross, Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Chandler, Hey  y'know  I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is  smoking is cool  and you know it.
Rachel,  Chandler? It's Alan  he wants to speak to you.
Chandler, Really? He does?  Hey  buddy  what's up! Oh  she told you about that  huh. Well  yeah  I have one now and then. Well  yeah  now. Well  it's not that big- ..well  that's true .. Gee  y'know  no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well  okay  thanks! 
Rachel,  God  he's good.
Ross, If only he were a woman.
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, Ooh  Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
Ross, Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 
Monica,  Hey. Where's Joey?
Chandler, Joey ate my last stick of gum  so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
Rachel, I think he's across the hall.
Monica, Thanks. 
Ross,  There y'go.
Chandler,  Ooh  I'm alive with pleasure now.
Ross, Hey Pheebs  you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Phoebe, Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
Ross, Hey  I might!
Phoebe, Sorry. ..Y'know  those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
Phoebe, And on my way over here  I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
Joey,  What's going on?
Monica, Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
Joey, Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
Rachel, Uh  Joey..
Joey, Oh  God! 
Monica,  Okay..
Monica, Please  guys  we have to talk.
Phoebe, Wait  wait  I'm getting a deja vu...no  I'm not.
Monica, Alright  we have to talk.
Phoebe, There it is!
Monica, Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean  there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
Ross, Is there somebody else?
Monica, No  nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
Rachel, We didn't change..
Joey, So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
Phoebe, You know.. you let your guard down  you start to really care about someone  and I just- I- 
Monica, Look  I- I could go on pretending-
Joey, Okay!
Monica, -but that wouldn't be fair to me  it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
Ross, Who-who wants fair? Y'know  I just want things back. Y'know  the way they were.
Monica, I'm sorry..
Chandler,  Oh  she's sorry! I feel better!
Rachel,  I just can't believe this! I mean  with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Monica, I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
Monica, Are you guys gonna be okay?
Ross, Hey hey  we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
Monica,  I understand.
Monica, I'm  I'm really sorry.
Monica, Relieved?
Rachel, Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Ross, Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Monica,  Hi.
Ross, So how'd it go?
Monica, Oh  y'know..
Phoebe, Did he mention us?
Monica, He said he's really gonna miss you guys. 
Ross, You had a rough day  huh.. c'mere. 
Chandler, ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
Chandler,  I don't care  I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
Phoebe,  If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Chandler,  Yeah  alright.
Monica, Alright. Phoebe?
Phoebe, Okay  okay. If I were omnipotent for a day  I would want  um  world peace  no more hunger  good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Ross, Yeah  see.. you took mine. Chandler  what about you?
Chandler, Uh  if I were omnipotent for a day  I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
Rachel," See  there's always one guy.  ""If I had a wish  I'd wish for three more wishes."" "
Monica, Hey  Joey  what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Joey, Probably kill myself!
Monica, ..Excuse me?
Joey, Hey  if Little Joey's dead  then I got no reason to live!
Ross, Joey  uh- OMnipotent.
Joey, You are? Ross  I'm sorry..
Monica, How does she do that?
Ross, I cannot sleep in a public place.
Monica, Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Phoebe,  Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Ross, It's okay  y'know  you just nodded off again.
Monica, What's going on with you?
Phoebe, I got no sleep last night!
Ross, Why?
Phoebe, My grandmother has this new boyfriend  and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh  and deaf. So they're constantly  like  having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Monica, Well  if you want  you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Phoebe, Thanks.
Joey, ...Ninety-five  ninety-six  ninety-seven. See  I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Chandler, You got waaaay too much free time.
Joey,  Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross  check it out: hockey tickets  Rangers-Penguins  tonight at the Garden  and we're taking you.
Chandler, Happy birthday  pal!
Joey, We love you  man. 
Ross, Funny  my birthday was seven months ago.
Joey, So?
Ross, So  I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Chandler," Well  aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
Ross, Oh my God  oh- is today the twentieth  October twentieth?
Monica, Oh  I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Ross, Ohhh.
Joey, What's wrong with the twentieth?
Chandler, Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
Ross, Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what  I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Joey, The hell with hockey  let's all do that!
Chandler,  C'mon  Ross! You  me  Joey  ice  guys' night out  c'mon  whaddya say  big guy   Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ross, What are you doing?
Chandler,  I have no idea.
Joey, C'mon  Ross!
Ross, Alright  alright  maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Chandler, You got it.
Rachel, Look-look-look-look-look  my first pay check! Look at the window  there's my name! Hi  me!
Phoebe, I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines  and eight people were killed.
Monica, Wow  you worked in a mine?
Phoebe, I worked in a Dairy Queen  why?
Rachel, God  isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it  I steamed milk for it  and it was totally——not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean  what- Chandler  look at that.
Chandler,  Oh  this is not that bad.
Joey, Oh  you're fine  yeah  for a first job.
Ross, You can totally  totally live on this.
Monica, Yeah  yeah.
Ross, Oh  by the way  great service tonight.
Rachel, Oh my God! (Rachel  Leslie  Kiki  and Joanne all scream and hug each other.
Monica,  I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Rachel, What are you guys doing here?
Rachel,  Look at you  you are so big I can't believe it!
Rachel,  So what's going on with you?
Phoebe,  Look  look  I have elbows! 
Chandler, ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! 
Joey, Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! 
Chandler, We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Ross, Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact  she  uh- she never took'em off  'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.
Joey, What?
Ross, Peach pit.
Chandler, Yes  Bunny?
Ross,  Peach pit. That night we  uh- we had-
Joey, -Peaches?
Ross, Actually  nectarines  but basically...
Chandler,  Could've been a peach.
Ross, Then  uh  then we got dressed  and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Joey, Hey  that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
Rachel, So c'mon  you guys  tell me all the dirt!
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, What? Guys  I'm not.
Rachel, I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Rachel, Okay  I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I  um... I write the specials on the specials board  and  uh... and I  uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh  and  um  sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
Monica, Hey  Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? 
Rachel, What's that?
Monica, Weeeell  it's rum  and-
Rachel, Okay. 
Monica, We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines  we got cookie dough  we got Twister... 
Phoebe, Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But  um  I lost the tweezers  so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Monica, Uh  Rach  it's the Visa card people.
Rachel, Oh  God  ask them what they want.
Monica,  Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?  Yes  hold on.  Um  they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Rachel, But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Monica, That is the unusual activity. Look  they just wanna see if you're okay.
Rachel, They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay  okay  let's see. Well  let's see  the FICA guys took all my money  everyone I know is either getting married  or getting promoted  or getting pregnant  and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay  okay  then you can tell them I'm okay  okay?
Monica,  Uh- Rachel has left the building  can you call back?
Rachel, Alright  c'mon!  Let's play Twister!
Ross,  Sorry  sorry... Uh-oh.
Chandler, What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Ross, No  actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it  there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Joey, C'mon  sit. Just sit down  sit.
Monica, You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Rachel, Monica  what is so amazing? I gave up  like  everything. And for what?
Phoebe, You are just like Jack.
Rachel, ...Jack from downstairs?
Phoebe, No  Jack and the Beanstalk.
Monica, Ah  the other Jack.
Phoebe, Yeah  right! See  he gave up something  but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up  and there was this  this big plant outside his window  full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village  and you live in the Village..
Rachel, Okay  but Pheebs  Pheebs  Jack gave up a cow  I gave up an orthodontist. Okay  I-I-I know  I know I didn't love him-
Phoebe, Oh  see  Jack did love the cow.
Rachel, But see  it was a plan. Y'know  it was clear. It was figured out  and now everything's just kinda like...
Phoebe, Floopy?
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, So what  you're not the only one. I mean  half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together  and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Phoebe, Oh  like that's a word.
Rachel, Okay  but Monica  what if- what if it doesn't come together?
Monica, ...Pheebs?
Phoebe, Oh  well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Rachel, Okay  see  see  you guys  what if we don't get magic beans? I mean  what if all we've got are.. beans?
Ross, Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now  are ya pal!
Chandler,  See buddy  that's all you need  a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Ross, Pass it! Pass it!
Chandler, He's open!
Chandler, Hey  look  we're on that TV thing!
Chandler, 'Scuse me.
Chandler, Listen  it's kind of an emergency. Well  I guess you know that  or we'd be in the predicament room. 
Ross,  Look  I don't wanna make any trouble  okay  but I'm in a lot of pain here  alright? My face is dented.
Joey, Well  how long do you think it'll be?
Ross, Hey  this-  Heyy...
Rachel, I'm so sorry  you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
Monica, No  you were right. I don't have a plan. 
Rachel, Thank God. Food. 
Monica, Phoebe?
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Do you have a plan?
Phoebe, I don't even have a 'pl'.
Rachel,  No  no  that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Monica,  Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Monica, Wait  was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Monica, Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Phoebe, And-and a power tie?
Monica,  Oh God.
Monica, Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! 
Rachel, Uh  Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Phoebe, Big Bird's friend.
Monica, I see pizza!
Phoebe, Oh  I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! 
Rachel, Hello? Who are we spying on?
Monica, White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair  sexy smile  really cute butt?
Rachel, Oh  him  the little guy? Oh  I love him!
Phoebe, Ooh  wait.. wait  I see a woman.
Monica, Please tell me it's his mother.
Phoebe, Definitely not his mother.
Monica, Oh  no...
Phoebe, Oh  wait  she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey  that's not for you  bitch! 
Chandler, Excuse me  look  we've been here for over an hour  and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean  that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh  c'mon Dora  don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean  but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know  I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!
Monica, Light still out?
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Rachel, Oh please  they're having sex.
Rachel, So  whaddya think George is like?
Monica, I think he's shy.
Phoebe, Yeah?
Monica, Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Ross, I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Chandler, Yes  the moon  the glow  the magical feeling  you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here  please?
Joey, He's right  enough  already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time  so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Ross, Look  it's just a little more complicated...
Chandler, Well  what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Ross, Little louder  okay  I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Chandler, Then what?
Ross, My first time with Carol was... 
Joey, What?
Ross, It was my first time.
Joey, With Carol?  Oh.
Chandler, So in your whole life  you've only been with one——oh.
Joey, Whoah  boy  hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
Monica, Okay. Okay  I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Monica, Well  unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay  fine  fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Monica, What?! You slept with Jason?
Phoebe, You'd already broken up.
Rachel, How long?
Phoebe, A couple hours.
Monica, Oh  that's nice!
Rachel, Okay  okay  okay  I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Monica, Excuse me?!
Rachel, Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one?  She was a big girl.
Monica, Really. Well  at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Rachel, I was laughing! You made me laugh! 
Phoebe, There he is! There he is!
Monica, Where?
Phoebe, Right- where we've been looking all night!
Rachel, He is so cute!
Monica, Oh  George  baby  drop the towel!
Joey, Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Chandler, I think it's great. Y'know  it's sweet  it's romantic...
Joey, Really?
Chandler, No  you kidding? The guy's a freak.. 
Ross, Hi. 
Chandler, Oh  I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on  admit it! All things considered  you had fun tonight.
Ross, Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically  which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Joey, Oh  ah- the kid has it.
Ross, The kid...?  Excuse me  uh  that's  that's my puck.
Chandler, You gotta do it  man.
Ross,  Oh yeah? Well  I'm rubber  you're glue  whatever——can't do it.  Listen  uh- gimme back my puck.
Ross, 'Yes'  how about. C'mere. Gimme!
Ross,  GIVE ME MY PUCK!! 
Ross, ...Now that was fun.
Ross,  Okay  Monica: Right foot red.
Monica, Could've played Monopoly  but nooooo.
Chandler, Thanks. 
Ross, Okay  Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. 
Chandler, Hello? Oh  uh  Rachel  it's the Visa card people.
Rachel, Oh  okay. Will you take my place?
Chandler, Alright.  Yes  this is Rachel.
Rachel, Nooo!   Hello?  Oh  yeah  no  I know  I-I haven't been using it much.  Oh  well  thanks  but  I'm okay  really.
Ross, Green. To the green.
Rachel,  I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
Chandler, To the left  to the left- aww! 
Rachel,  Ohhh... I'm fine.
Monica, Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ross, Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok  you just reach in there  there's one little maneuver  and bam  a bra right out the sleeve. All right  as far as I'm concerned  there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Rachel, Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Chandler, We can? All right  I'm tryin' that.
Joey, Ok  you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Phoebe, Oh  ok  you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things  and then not even care.
Ross, Multiple orgasms!
Chandler, So  Saturday night  the big night  date night  Saturday night  Sat-ur-day night!
Joey, No plans  huh?
Chandler, Not a one.
Ross, Not even  say  breaking up with Janice?
Chandler, Oh  right  right  shut up.
Monica, Chandler  nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Chandler, No  I know  but it's just so hard  you know? I mean  you're sitting there with her  she has no idea what's happening  and then you finally get up the courage to do it  and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
Joey, Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man  just stop calling.
Phoebe, You know  if you want  I'll do it with you.
Chandler, Oh  thanks  but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Phoebe, No  I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Ross, Tony?
Monica, Oh  you're breaking up with Tony?
Phoebe, Yeah  I know  he's sweet  but it's just not fun anymore  you know? I don't know if it's me  or his hunger strike  or  I don't know.
Rachel,  Does anybody want anything else?
Ross, Oh  yeah  last week you had a wonderful  nutty  chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing  just  just  I'm fine.
Phoebe,  What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Rachel, It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Ross, That guy  he burns me up.
Rachel, Yeah  well  it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh  it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Chandler, Ooh  I hate when my father calls me that.
Monica," Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?"
Rachel," Oh  yeah  yeah. Actually  I got the extended disco version  with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
Phoebe,  Uh-huh  uh-huh.
Joey, My god  Angela.
Monica, Wow  being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Phoebe, Are you gonna go over there?
Joey, No  yeah  no  ok  but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi  two Mississippi  three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey  Angela.
Joey, You look good.
Joey, You don't say.
Ross, So  uh  Rachel  what are you  uh  what're you doing tonight?
Rachel, Oh  big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Ross, Oh  you uh  you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Rachel, Who?
Ross, Me. Was that not clear? Hey  why don't  um  why don't I just join you both  here?
Rachel, Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ross, Yes  I do have a laundry room in my building  um  but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets  and they're goin' in fine  but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway  say  sevenish?
Rachel, Sure.
Joey, Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Joey, Come on  we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff  but like  talking too.
Joey, What?
Joey, Fine  fine  so  why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know  as friends?
Joey, You know  you and Bob  and me and my girlfriend  uh  uh  Monica.
Joey, Monica  I'm tellin' you  this guy is perfect for you.
Monica, Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey, Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart  he's sophisticated  and he has a real job. Me  I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor  but Bob is...
Monica,  Oh  god help us.
Joey, What?
Monica, Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Joey, Eww! Look  I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother  maybe Angela will come back to me.
Monica, What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Joey,  I know  but  I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
Ross,  Ok  bye.  Well  Monica's not coming  it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Chandler, Oh. Well  hold on camper  are you sure you've thought this thing through?
Ross, It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Chandler, It's just you and Rachel  just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Ross, Nuh-uh.
Chandler, Yuh-huh.
Ross, So what're you saying here? I should shave again  pick up some wine  what?
Chandler, Well  you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
Ross,  No.
Chandler, Oh  and uh  the fabric softener?
Ross, Ok  ok  now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What  it says I'm a sensitive  warm kinda guy  you know  like a warm  fuzzy bear. Ok  I can pick something else up on the way.
Chandler, There you go.
Monica, Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Joey, Yep.
Monica, Which?
Joey, Which what?
Monica, You've never met Bob  have you?
Joey, No  but he's...
Monica, Oh my god  Joey  for all we know this guy could be horribly...
Monica, ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Chandler, Where are they? Where are they?
Phoebe, This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Chandler, It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Phoebe, Eww  I don't wanna do that.
Chandler, Here we go.
Phoebe, Ok  have a good break-up.
Chandler, Hey  Janice.
Chandler, Hey  that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here  please?
Chandler, What?
Chandler,  What... did you get me there?
Chandler, Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Chandler, That's great.
Chandler, Well  I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
Chandler, That's it?
Phoebe, Yeah  it was really hard.
Chandler, Oh  yeah  that hug looked pretty brutal.
Phoebe, Ok  you weren't there.
Rachel, Oh  'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Rachel, But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Rachel, What?
Ross, What's goin' on?
Rachel, Hi  uh  nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Ross, Was your basket on top?
Rachel, Yeah  but  there were no suds.
Ross, So?
Rachel, Well  you know  no suds  no save.
Ross, No suds? Excuse me  hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Ross, Hey  hey  hey  that's not the rule and you know it.
Ross,  All right  show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok  let's do laundry.
Rachel, That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Ross, Well  that's because you're such a sweet  gentle  uh...Do you  uh  do you...Oh  hey  uh you must need detergent.
Rachel, What's that?
Ross, Uberveiss. It's new  it's German  it's extra-tough.
Ross, Rach  do you uh  are you gonna separate those?
Rachel, Oh god. Oh  am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean  am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Ross, Rach  have you never done this before?
Rachel, Well  not myself  but I know other people that have. Ok  you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Ross, Uh  well  don't worry  I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok  um  basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites  a whole nother machine for colors  and a third for your uh  your uh  delicates  and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Rachel,  Ok  Well  what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Ross,  Uh  that  that  that would be a judgment call.
Monica,  He is so cute.  So  where did you guys grow up?
Monica, How  how did that happen?
Joey, Oh my god.
Monica, What?
Joey, I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Joey, So  you and Angela  huh?
Joey, You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel  or a weasel.
Joey, Oh  yeah  yeah  listen for it.
Joey, Yeah  but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
Monica, I've gotta tell you  Bob is terrific.
Monica, It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny  and has an emotional age beyond  like eight.
Monica, Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Phoebe, Ok  you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast  and then the wound is exposed.
Chandler, Janice. Hi  Janice. Ok  here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Rachel, Ok  I know this is gonna sound really stupid  but I feel that if I can do this  you know  if I can actually do my own laundry  there isn't anything I can't do.
Ross, That does not sound stupid to me. You know  it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself  after Carol left me?  I'm sorry  that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
Rachel, What uh-oh?
Ross,  Uh-oh  uh-oh  the laundry's done. It's  uh  it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done  uh-oh  uh-oh.
Rachel, Ross  what's the matter?
Ross, Nothing  nothing. Lee-lo  the laundry's done.
Rachel, Come on  show me.
Ross, All right  all right  it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites  and now  everything's kinda pink.
Rachel, Oh  everything's pink.
Ross, Yeah  uh  except for the red sock  which is still red. I'm sorry  please don't be upset  it could happen to anyone.
Rachel, Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh  god  I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
Monica, Something went wrong with Underdog  and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway  um  his head is like flopping down Broadway  right  and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um  I've got something in my eye  uh  Joey  could we check it in the light  please?
Monica, Oh my god.
Joey, What?
Monica, Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Joey, Come on  they're close.
Monica, Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey, Oh  like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Monica, Joey  this is sick  it's disgusting  it's  it's—not really true  is it?
Joey, Well  who's to say what's true? I mean...
Monica, Oh my god  what were you thinking?
Joey, All right  look  I'm not proud of this  ok? Well  maybe I am a little.
Monica,  Oh!
Joey, Ow!
Monica,  I'm outta here.
Joey, Wait  wait  wait. You want him  I want her. He likes you.
Monica, Really?
Joey, Yeah. I'm thinking  if we put our heads together  between the two of us  we can break them up.
Monica, I'm so sorry  I can't believe I did this  but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
Joey, Uh  waiter  one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Chandler, Here's the thing  Janice. You know  I mean  it's like we're different. I'm like the bing  bing  bing. You're like the boom  boom  ... boom.
Chandler, Oh  my god  I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Chandler,  I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Phoebe, Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Chandler, Oh  I don't know  a million?
Phoebe, Chandler  easy  easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Chandler, I'm fine.
Phoebe, All right.
Chandler, I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Phoebe, Wait here. Breathe.
Chandler, How do you do that?
Phoebe, It's like a gift.
Chandler, We should always always break up together.
Phoebe, Oh  I'd like that.
Ross, You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Rachel, Oh  I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
Rachel, Whoa  I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
Rachel, I'm sorry  you know  maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh  this is our cart.
Rachel, Hey  hey  hey  hey  quit making up rules!
Rachel, All right  listen  missy. If you want this cart  you're gonna have to take me with it!
Rachel,  Yes! Did you see that?
Ross, You were incredible! Brand new woman  ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
Ross, Ok  um  uh  more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine  I'm fine.
Rachel, Are you sure?
Ross, No.
Rachel, Oh  are you sure you're ok?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Does it still hurt?
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe,  What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Monica, Hi.
Phoebe, Hey  how'd it go?
Joey, Excellent.
Monica, We ripped that couple apart  and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Ross, What a beautiful story. Hey  I'm fine by the way.
Monica,  Oh  I'm sorry.
Rachel, Where's Chandler?
Phoebe, Oh  he needed some time to grieve.
Chandler, I'm free! I'm free!
Phoebe, That oughta do it.
Rachel,  Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look  there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
Chandler, You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice  no fear  no sense of impending doom...
Phoebe, The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know  it's not just Freud  it's Freud!
Ross, Oh  shhh  shh. Magic is about to happen.
Joey, Vell  Eva  ve've done some excellent vork here  and I vould have to say  your pwoblem is qviiite clear. 
Rachel, God. I feel violated.
Monica, Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body  to have something else to do?
Chandler,  Ross  ten o'clock.
Ross, Is it? Feels like two.
Chandler, No  ten o'clock.
Ross, What?
Chandler,  There's a beautiful woman at eight  nine  ten o'clock!
Ross, Oh. Hel-lo!
Chandler, She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short  fat  bald men!
Monica, Well  go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Chandler, Oh yeah  and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Rachel, Oh  c'mon. She's a person  you can do it!
Chandler, Oh please  could she be more out of my league? Ross  back me up here.
Ross, He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Chandler, Thank you  buddy.
Phoebe, Oh  oh  but y'know  you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys  you could be one of those guys.
Monica, You could do that!
Chandler, Y'think?
Chandler, Oh God  I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
Ross, C'mon! C'mon!
Chandler, Here goes. 
Chandler, Hi.... um... okay  next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name  and  uh......hi.
Chandler, Yes  yes I did  but what I didn't say was what I was about to say  what I wanted to say was  uh... would you like to go out with me sometime  thankyou  goodnight. 
Joey, Whadja think?
Joey, C'mon  you guys  it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls  at least you got to see my head.
Chandler,  She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play  man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora  and she's Italian  and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh  listen  the usher gave me this to give to you. 
Rachel, What is it?
Joey, The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow  an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Phoebe, Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
Chandler, Hey  kids.
Phoebe,  No  'cause this line is passion  and this is... just a line.
Chandler, Well  I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Monica, Oh  right  right. How was your date  'Chand-lrr'?
Chandler, It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
Chandler, Alright. Once I got on the subway  right  and it was at night  and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
Chandler, We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
Chandler, Oh  I'm sorry  so 'we' is?
Joey, Who's Rick?
Chandler, Who's Rick?
Chandler, Oh  so you're divorced?
Chandler, Oh  I'm sorry  then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
Chandler, So tell me  how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Chandler, Ethan? There's  there's an Ethan?
Chandler, So explain something to me here  uh  what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
Chandler, ...Hm.
Monica, Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Chandler, What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Monica, Didn't you listen to the story? I mean  this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Chandler, Well  y'know  I had some trouble with it at first too  but the way I look at it is  I get all the good stuff: all the fun  all the talking  all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean  this is every guy's fantasy!
Phoebe, Oh  yeah. That is not true. Ross  is this your fantasy?
Ross, No  of course not!  ...Yeah  yeah  it is.
Monica, What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Joey, I couldn't do it.
Monica, Good for you  Joey.
Joey, When I'm with a woman  I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Ross, Well  y'know  monogamy can be a  uh  tricky concept. I mean  anthropologically speaking-
Ross, Fine. Fine  alright  now you'll never know.
Monica, We're kidding. C'mon  tell us!
Ross, Alright. There's a theory  put forth by Richard Leakey-
Rachel, Tah-daaah!
Chandler, Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Rachel, Look! I cleaned! I did the windows  I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum  except that little round one with the bristles  I don't know what that's for.
Ross, Oh yeah  nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Rachel, Well  whaddya think?
Monica, ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica, How-how did that happen?
Rachel, I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also  it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
Monica, Yeah  yeah  it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun  let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright  just to compare. Let's see. Well  it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Phoebe,  I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Chandler, Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean  she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Monica, You guys  I am not that bad!
Phoebe, Yeah  you are  Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like  a little  y'know   Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Monica, That is so unfair!
Ross, Oh c'mon! When we were kids  yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Monica, Okay  so I'm responsible  I'm organised. But hey  I can be a kook.
Ross, Alright  you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives  but you don't pay it right away.
Monica, Why not?
Ross, Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Monica, I could do that.
Rachel, Okay  uh  you let me go grocery shopping  and I buy laundry detergent  but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
Monica, Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Chandler, Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink  it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
Monica, STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Ross, Monica? You're Mom.
Phoebe, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Joey,  Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay  I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Monica, Well  what's the part?
Joey," Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"""
Phoebe, Seriously  what-what's the part?
Joey," ""Just when I thought I was out  they pull me back in!"""
Ross, C'mon  seriously  Joey  what's the part?
Joey, ...I'm his 
Rachel, ..You're  you're 'mah mah mah' what?
Joey, ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower  and then- I'm his butt.
Monica,  Oh my God.
Joey, C'mon  you guys. This is a real movie  and Al Pacino's in it  and that's big!
Chandler, Oh no  it's terrific  it's... it's... y'know  you deserve this  after all your years of struggling  you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Joey, Okay  okay  fine! Make jokes  I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Ross, You're right  you're right  it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Monica, Alright  alright  alright...
Joey, Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Monica, For what?
Joey, Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Monica, Oh my God. Okay  go into the bathroom  use whatever you want  just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Joey, Thank you! 
Chandler, Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Monica, He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Chandler, C'mon  we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
Monica, I warned you...
Rachel, Who is being loud?
Chandler, Oh  that would be Monica. Hey  listen  I wanna borrow a coupla things  Aurora spent the night  I really wanna make her breakfast.
Monica, Oh  you got the whole night  huh?
Chandler, Yeah  well  I only have twenty minutes until Ethan  so  y'know.. 
Rachel, Ooh  do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Chandler, No  no resentment  believe me  it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well  every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people  so  uh.. Monica  can you help me with the door? 
Monica, Sure. Oh  um  Chandler? Y'know  the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
Joey, Uh  listen  I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Joey, Me?
Joey, Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.
Joey, Well  I'm- I'm showering.
Joey, Oh. Well  the way I see it  the guy's upset here  y'know? I mean  his wife's dead  his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Joey, I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Chandler, God  I love these fingers...
Chandler, No  actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em  look at how happy they are.
Chandler, Oh no nonononononnononono  don't go.. 
Chandler, Don't go.
Chandler,  Too bad  she's leaving.
Chandler, Well  I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
Chandler, What  Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
Chandler, I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question  but- And Andrew is?
Chandler, Oh  so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick  Ethan and myself?
Chandler, Well  y'know  most women would kill for three guys like us.
Chandler, You.
Chandler, Nono  just you.
Chandler, Lose the other guys.
Chandler, C'mon  we're great together  why not?
Chandler, ...Well  y'know  part of me wants that  but it's like I'm two guys  y'know? I mean  one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying  y'know  'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
Chandler, I don't know  I-I have to listen to both of them  they don't exactly let each other finish...
Chandler, ...The second guy.
Chandler, Sorry  the first guy runs the lips.
Ross, Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean  this woman was unbelievably sexy  and beautiful  intelligent  unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
Monica, Hey  waitwait  aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Joey, Nope.
Ross, No? What happened  big guy?
Chandler,"  ""Big guy?"""
Ross, It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Joey, I got fired.
Joey, Yeah  they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre  expecting to see me  and...
Rachel, Oh  Joey  you know what  no-one is gonna be able to tell.
Joey, My mom will.
Chandler, Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
Joey, Y'know  I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot  and I blow it!
Monica, Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Ross, Yeah  I mean... I think when it's your shot  y'know  you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
Joey, Hard to tell  I was naked.
Phoebe, No  I don't think this was your shot. I mean  I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you  I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Joey, Yeah? That's so nice! 
Monica, I'm sorry  Joey. I'm gonna go to bed  guys.
Rachel, Uh  Mon  you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Monica,  Uh-huh!
Rachel, Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Monica, Doesn't matter  I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. 
Ross, She is a kook.
Monica,  If it bothers you that much  just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything  I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them  and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! 
Rachel, Everybody? Shh  shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe, Hi. Um  I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK  here we go.  OK  thank you very much.
Chandler, Oh  great. This is just...
Rachel, Wow  this is so cool  you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Monica, Mom says it's all of Manhattan  parts of Brooklyn and Queens  and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Rachel, Wow  you guys  this is big.
Monica,  Pants and a sweater? Why  mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. 
Phoebe, Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?
Phoebe, Well  I never call me.
Chandler, Oh my God  it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Chandler, She's right  it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh  yeah  that is the part to focus on  you idiot!
Chandler, Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Chandler, Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill  I saw you with some guy last night. Yes  he was some guy.
Joey, Hi everyone.
Ross, And officiating at tonight's blackout  is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Joey, Well  Chandler's old roomate was Jewish  and these are the only candles we have  so... Happy Chanukah  everyone.
Phoebe,  Eww  look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel, That had to hurt!
Chandler, Alright  alright  alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God  do something. Just make contact  smile!
Chandler, There you go!
Chandler, You're definitely scaring here.
Chandler, Yeah  about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah  thanks. 
Monica, Hello?
Chandler, Hey  it's me.
Monica,  It's Chandler!  Are you OK?
Chandler, Yeah  I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Monica, What?
Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica, I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler,  Put Joey on the phone.
Joey, What's up man?
Chandler, I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Joey,  Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler  listen. 
Chandler, Yeah  like that thought never entered my mind.
Rachel, Alright  somebody.
Monica, OK  I'll go. OK  senior year of college... on a pool table.
Ross, That's my sister.
Joey, OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Monica, Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross, Pheebs  what about you?
Phoebe, Oh... Milwaukee.
Rachel, Um... Ross?
Ross, Disneyland  1989  'It's a Small World After All.'
Ross, The ride broke down. So  Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride  and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Phoebe, Oh  Rachel.
Rachel, Oh come on  I already went.
Monica, You did not go!
Rachel, Oh  alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh  the foot of the bed.
Ross, Step back.
Joey, We have a winner!
Rachel, I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion  you know  where you have to have somebody right there  in the middle of a theme park.
Ross, Well  it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Rachel, There  well  see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
Ross, Come on.
Rachel, No  he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Ross,  And you didn't marry him because...?
Rachel, I mean  do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Ross, Probably. But you know  I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Rachel, Yeah right.
Ross, It is. Eventually  it kind of... burns out. But hopefully  what you're left with is trust  and security  and... well  in the case of my ex-wife  lesbianism. So  you know  for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing  there's all that other good stuff.
Rachel,  OK.
Ross, But  um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Rachel, You don't.
Ross, Uh-uh. See  I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel, Really?
Ross, Mmmm.
Rachel, You do?
Ross, I do.
Rachel, Oh Ross  you're so great. 
Joey, It's never gonna happen.
Ross,  What?
Joey, You and Rachel.
Ross,  What?  Why not?
Joey, Because you waited too long to make your move  and now you're in the friend zone.
Ross, No  no  no. I'm not in the zone.
Joey, Ross  you're mayor of the zone.
Ross, I'm taking my time  alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean  every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Joey, Priesthood! Look Ross  I'm telling you  she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross, I will  I will. See  I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What  now?
Joey, Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say  'Rachel  I think that...' 
Ross, Shhhh!
Rachel, What are you shushing?
Ross, We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Rachel, Ahhhh!
Ross, See?
Rachel, Huh. 
Chandler, Um  is it sugarless?
Chandler, Oh  then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum  you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass  you take it.
Phoebe,  New York City has no power  and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary  'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la  la la  la la... 
Ross,  OK  here goes.
Joey, Are you going to do it?
Ross, I'm going to do it.
Joey, Do you want any help?
Ross, You come out there  you're a dead man.
Joey, Good luck  man.
Ross, Thanks.  OK.
Joey, OK. 
Joey, Hey  where are you going?
Monica, Outside.
Joey, You can't go out there.
Monica, Why not?
Joey, Because of... the reason.
Monica, And that would be?
Joey, I  um  can't tell you.
Monica, Joey  what's going on?
Joey, OK  you've got to promise that you'll never  ever tell Ross that I told you.
Monica, About what?
Joey, He's planning your birthday party.
Monica, Oh my God! I love him!
Joey,  You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe, About what?
Monica, My surprise party!
Phoebe, What surprise party?
Monica, Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe, Well  he didn't tell me.
Joey, Hey  don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Phoebe, This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Monica, No  you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe, Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.
Rachel, Hmmm... this is so nice.
Ross, OK  I have a question. Well  actually  it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel, OK.
Ross, OK. Here goes. For a while now  I've been wanting to  um....
Rachel, Ohhh!!!! 
Ross, Yes  yes  that's right...
Rachel, Oh  look at the little cat! 
Ross, What?  Ow!
Monica,  This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Joey, Sorry  that was wax.
Phoebe, Oh  poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ross, Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel, During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross,  Yeah?
Chandler, You know  on second thought  gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice ' or 'I'll have a stick ' but no  no  no  no. For me  gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Phoebe,  Oh no  the Mendels  they hate all living things  right?
Rachel, Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Phoebe,  He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Phoebe, Wait a minute. What's his name?
Rachel, Bob Buttons?
Phoebe,  Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Rachel, Here  kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go  little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Rachel, Wow. 
Ross,  Lucky sixes....
Rachel,  Everybody  this is Paolo. Paolo  I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica,  Hi!
Rachel, And Joey....
Monica, Hi!
Rachel, And Ross.
Monica, Hi!
Rachel,  He doesn't speak much English.
Rachel, Look at that!
Ross,  So  um... where did Paolo come from?
Rachel, Oh... Italy  I think.
Ross, No  I mean tonight  in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Rachel, Well  the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Ross, That  that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Phoebe, Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Rachel, Oh  I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Phoebe, Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Rachel, Ah  Paolo  this is Phoebe.
Phoebe,  You betcha!
Chandler,  Ah  let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm  it's impish. Here we go.
Chandler, Nice going  imp. OK  it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. 
Chandler, Good save! We're back on track  and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
Chandler,  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Ross,  Blah blah blah  blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Ross, Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Rachel, I have absolutely no idea.
Ross, That's... that's classic.
Rachel,  Oh my God  you guys  what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Monica, If you want  I'll do it.
Phoebe, I know  I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.
Rachel, God  the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Phoebe, You know  did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh  I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Rachel, Y'know  I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common  and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Ross, Paolo. Hi.
Ross, Listen. Um  listen. Something you should... know... um  Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Ross, Thing  yes. Thing.
Ross, No  no  no. Technically the... sex is not... being had  but that's... see  that's not the point. See  um  the point is that... Rachel and I should be  er  together. You know  and if you get in the.... um...
Ross, No  no  that's not where I was going. Er  if you get in the... way  of us becoming a thing  then I would be  well  very sad.
Ross, Yeah! Se vice?
Ross, So you do know a little English.
Ross, Do you know the word crapweasel?
Ross, That's funny  because you know  you are a huge crapweasel!
Chandler, OK.
Phoebe, Oh  look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10  9  8  7... ... negative 46  negative 47  negative 48.... 
Ross, Thank you.
Phoebe, Thanks.
Ross, Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey,  Bwah-hah-hah!
Ross, OK  guys  guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Ross, Oh.. oh... oh.
Joey, Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up  but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Chandler, Yes. Yes  thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Chandler, Hi  um  I'm account number 7143457. And  uh  I don't know if you got any of that  but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Chandler, Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Chandler, Ah  y'see  perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent'  or 'self-destructive'...
Chandler, Yes please.
Chandler, He's a he?
Chandler, ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean  is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Rachel, Um... yeah. Well  I mean  when I first met you  y'know  I thought maybe  possibly  you might be...
Chandler, You did?
Rachel, Yeah  but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts  so then I figured maybe not.
Chandler, Huh. Did  uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Monica, I did.
Phoebe, Yeah  I think so  yeah.
Joey, Not me.
Ross, Nono  me neither. Although  uh  y'know  back in college  Susan Sallidor did.
Chandler, You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross, No. No  it's just 'cause  uh  I kinda wanted to go out with her too  so I told her  actually  you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her  so...
Chandler, Well  this is fascinating. So  uh  what is it about me?
Phoebe, I dunno  'cause you're smart  you're funny...
Chandler, Ross is smart and funny  d'you ever think that about him?
Chandler, WHAT IS IT?!
Monica, Okay  I-I d'know  you-you just- you have a quality.
Chandler, Oh  oh  a quality  good  because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Monica, Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel  it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Rachel, Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno  caro mio.
Ross,  So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Rachel, Monica  your dad just beeped in  but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
Monica, Hey dad  what's up?  Oh God. Ross  it's Nana.
Ross, So  uh  how's she doing?
Monica, How-how are you  Mom?
Monica, What?
Monica, Nothing.
Monica, She is unbelievable  our mother is...
Ross, Okay  relax  relax. We are gonna be here for a while  it looks like  and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Monica, Oh God!
Monica, The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Ross, Oh! ...Yeah  they were gross. Oh  you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
Ross, She looks so small.
Monica, I know.
Ross, Well  at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Monica, G'bye  Nana. 
Ross, Bye  Nana.
Monica, Ross!
Ross, Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well  she's not  quite..
Ross, She's not- past  she's present  she's back.
Ross, I  uh  I'll go see. 
Ross, Now she's passed.
Chandler, I just have to know  okay. Is it my hair?
Rachel,  Yes  Chandler  that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
Phoebe, Yeah  you have homosexual hair.
Rachel, So  um  did she...
Ross, Twice.
Joey, Twice?
Phoebe, Oh  that sucks!
Joey, You guys okay?
Ross, I dunno  it's weird. I mean  I know she's gone  but I just don't feel  uh...
Phoebe, Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Ross, Nono  she's gone.
Monica, We checked. A lot.
Phoebe, Hm  I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died  every now and then  I get the feeling that she's like right here  y'know?  Oh! And Debbie  my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils  y'know? ...I miss her.
Rachel, Aw. Hey  Pheebs  want this? 
Phoebe, Thanks!
Rachel, Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey, Now  see  I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead  you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay  huh?
Phoebe, Y'know  I dunno who this is  but it's not Debbie. 
Ross, I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Ross,  I don't see why not.
Ross, Here's my retainer!
Monica, Dad!
Monica, You what?
Monica, Define fun.
Monica, ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee  that does sound fun.
Monica, That's probably what they'll say.
Chandler, Hey  gorgeous.
Chandler, No  nono  don't- don't worry about it. Believe me  apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Chandler, So  uh... what do you think it is about me?
Chandler, ...Quality  right  great.
Chandler, Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell  that's who you saw me with?
Chandler, Well  yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Chandler, No! Uh  I d'know! The point is  if you were gonna set me up with someone  I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Chandler, Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Ross,  This one?
Ross, I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit  go with the burgundy.
Ross, Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. 
Ross, Okay. Um  how about these? 
Ross, And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Ross,  Okay  I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
Ross, No! Nonono  wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
Ross, Oh my God..
Ross, Yeah  just... just Nana stuff.
Ross,  How we doing  you guys ready?
Monica, Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Ross, Some days it's all I can think about.
Phoebe,  Hi  sorry I'm late  I couldn't find my bearings.
Rachel, Oh  you-you mean your earrings?
Phoebe, What'd I say?
Rachel,  Hm-m.
Monica, Are these the shoes?
Rachel, Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Ross, What  we-uh- we don't have shoes here  or...?
Joey,  Morning. We ready to go?
Chandler, Well  don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that  isn't it?
Monica, It was a really beautiful service.
Joey, What?
Chandler, Nothing  just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Joey, Check it out  Giants-Cowboys. 
Chandler, You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Joey, No  it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Chandler, You are a frightening  frightening man.
Rachel, Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross, Oh  I hope they're not ruined.
Phoebe, God  what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Ross, I know  uh  the air  the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's  there's something almost  uh- I dunno  almost life-aff- 
Ross, I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Phoebe, Okay  don't worry  I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Ross, What  what is it?
Phoebe, You missed a belt loop.
Ross, Oh! No-n-
Phoebe, Okay  it's in spasm.
Chandler, Oh  no-
Chandler, Hi  I'm Chandler  and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Phoebe, Hey  look who's up! How do you feel?
Ross, I feel great. I feel- great  I fleel great.
Monica, Wow  those pills really worked  huh?
Ross, Not the first two  but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister   I love Pheebs... 
Phoebe, Ooh! That's so nice...
Ross, ...Chandler!
Chandler, Hey.
Ross,  And listen  man  if you wanna be gay  be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Ross, Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.
Rachel,  Oh  well you know who I love the most?
Ross, No.
Rachel, You!
Ross, Oh.. you don't get it! 
Joey,  Just a  uh... hearing disability.
Joey, Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Rachel,  Pheebs  could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Monica, Well  sure  what with it being her funeral and all.
Monica, That sounds like Nana.
Monica, ...I can imagine.
Monica, That is a wonder. So tell me something  Mom. If you had to do it all over again  I mean  if she was here right now  would you tell her?
Monica, How she drove you crazy  picking on every little detail  like your hair... for example.
Monica, Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Monica, Huh.
Monica, Oh  I think so.
Monica, Thank you. They're yours.
Rachel, Hey  who's this little naked guy?
Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel, Aww  look at the little thing.
Ross, Yes  yes  fine  that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler, Who are those people?
Ross, Got me.
Monica, Oh  that's Nana  right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel, Wow  Monica  you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica, Let's see  1939... yeah  24  25?
Ross, Looks like a fun gang. 
Joey, Ooh  look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross,  Nono  that would be me again. I'm  uh  just trying something.
Chandler, Hey  Lowell.
Chandler, So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Chandler, Good  good. Listen  heh  I dunno what Shelley told you about me  but  uh... I'm not.
Chandler, Really.
Chandler, So- you can tell?
Chandler, So you don't think I have a  a quality?
Chandler, He is?
Chandler, Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  If I wanted to get a Brian  I could get a Brian.  Hey  Brian.
Rachel, Terry  I  I  I know that I haven't worked here very long  but I was wondering  do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
Rachel, It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See  every year we go skiing in Vail  and normally my father pays for my ticket  but I sort of started the whole independence thing  you know  which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Ok  I  I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um  but I  but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh  look at that.
Rachel, Excuse me  sir. Hi  you come in here all time. I was just wondering  do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Rachel, Ok  ok  that's fine. Fine. Hey  I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.
Monica, Hey. Ross  did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ross, No  they're not.
Monica, Yes  they are. The Blymens invited them.
Ross, You're wrong.
Monica, I am not wrong.
Ross, You're wrong.
Monica, No  I just talked to them.
Ross,  I'm calling Mom.
Joey, Hey  hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey.
Chandler, And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Joey, Yes  I am. As of today  I am officially Joey Tribbiani  actor slash model.
Chandler, That's so funny  'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani  man slash woman.
Phoebe, What were you modeling for?
Joey, You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Monica," Oh  wow  so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy  healthy  healthy guys""?"
Phoebe, You know  the asthma guy was really cute.
Chandler, Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Joey, No  but I hear lyme disease is open  so... 
Chandler, Good luck  man. I hope you get it.
Joey, Thanks.
Ross,  Well  you were right. How can they do this to us  huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Monica, Ok  I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Ross, Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Monica, You know  they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey  you're going home  right?
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, And I assume  Chandler  you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Chandler, Yes  every single one of them.
Monica, Phoebe  you're gonna be with your grandma?
Phoebe, Yes  and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Monica, So you're free Thursday  then.
Phoebe, Yeah. Oh  can I come?
Monica, Yeah. Rach  are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Rachel, Absolutely. Shoop  shoop  shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
Chandler, I thought it was $98.50.
Rachel, Yeah  well it was. I  I broke a cup.
Ross, Well  I'm off to Carol's.
Phoebe, Ooh  ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Ross,  Ooh  ooh. Because she's my ex-wife  and will probably want to bring her  ooh  ooh  lesbian life partner.
Ross, Hi  is uh  is Carol here?
Ross, Oh  I uh  just came by to pick up my skull. Well  not mine  but...Susan: Come in.
Ross, Thanks. Yeah  Carol borrowed it for a class  and I have to get it back to the museum.
Ross, Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ross, Ok.  Wow  you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Ross,  Hey  hey  Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Ross, The uh  the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Ross, You're not serious  I mean  you really... you really talk to it?
Ross, Do you uh  do you talk about me?
Ross, Really?
Ross, Look  if she's talking to it  I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Phoebe, Oh  I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look  this will seem a little weird  but you put your head inside this turkey  and then we'll all talk  and you'll hear everything we say.
Chandler, I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact  I'd very much like to butter your head.
Monica, Hey  Rach  did you make your money?
Rachel, No  not even close. Forget Vail  forget seeing my family  forget shoop  shoop  shoop.
Monica, Rach  here's your mail.
Rachel, Thanks  you can just put it on the table.
Monica,  No  here's your mail.
Rachel, Thanks  you can just put it on the table.
Monica,  Would you just open it?
Rachel, Oh my god  oh  you guys are great.
Monica, We all chipped in.
Joey,  We did?
Monica,  You owe me 20 bucks.
Rachel, Thank you. Thank you so much!
Monica,  Chandler  here you go  got your traditional Thanksgiving feast  you got your tomato soup  your grilled cheese fixin's  and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Rachel, Wait  wait  Chandler  this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What  what  what is it with you and this holiday?
Chandler, All right  I'm nine years old.
Ross, Oh  I hate this story.
Chandler, We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie  and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Rachel, Oh my god.
Chandler, Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Joey, Uh  hi. We uh  we used to work together.
Joey, Yeah  at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl  right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?
Joey, I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Joey, I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz  when to lay back.
Joey, Ooh  you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Joey, Listen  uh  you wanna go get a drink or something?
Joey, What's wrong?
Joey, Oh. What?
Joey, Wait  wait  wait!
Joey, So I guess you all saw it.
Rachel, Saw what?
Phoebe, No  we were just laughing. You know  how laughter can be infectious.
Joey, Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Chandler, Tonight  on a very special Blossom.
Monica, Mmm  looking good. Ok  cider's mulling  turkey's turking  yams are yamming.  What?
Ross, I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Monica, All right  that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Ross, That's closer.
Rachel, I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now  shoop  shoop  shoop.
Chandler, Oh  you must stop shooping.
Rachel, Ok  I'm gonna get my stuff.
Joey, Chandler  will you just come in already?
Chandler, No  I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Phoebe, Look out  incoming pumpkin pie!
Chandler, Ok  we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing  but that's not funny anymore.
Joey, Hey  Monica  I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Monica, That's not a question.
Joey, But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork  a little cranberry sauce  and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Monica, All right  fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps  and in the form of tots.
Ross, Ok  I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Monica, Ah!
Ross, Ok  Mom never hit.
Phoebe,  Ok  all done.
Monica, What  Phoebe  did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Phoebe, Oh  I'm sorry  oh  I just  I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Monica, Why would we do that?
Phoebe, Well  'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them  you know  before she died.
Monica, Ok  three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Rachel, Ok  good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh  sorry! Oh  sorry!
Chandler, The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Joey, The balloon?
Chandler, No  no  the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's  he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof  who's with me?
Rachel, I can't  I gotta go.
Chandler, Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Phoebe, Almost never.
Monica, Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Rachel, Ok.
Ross, Ok  ok  here we go.  Ok  where am I talking to  here? I mean  uh  well  there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage  but...
Ross, Ok  ok  ok  ok  here goes. You know  I  you know  can't do this. Uh  this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Ross,  Hello  baby. Hello  hello.
Rachel, I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Phoebe, Yeah  but did they have to shoot him down? I mean  that was just mean.
Monica, Ok  right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside  juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Rachel, We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica, No I don't.
Rachel," Yes  you do. When we left  you said  ""got the keys."""
Monica," No I didn't. I asked  ""got the ke-eys?"""
Rachel," No  no  no  you said  ""got the keys""."
Chandler, Do either of you have the keys?
Monica,  The oven is on.
Rachel, Oh  I gotta get my ticket!
Joey, Wait  wait  we have a copy of your key.
Monica, Well then get it  get it!
Joey, That tone will not make me go any faster.
Monica,  Joey!
Joey, That one will.
Ross, And everyone's telling me  you gotta pick a major  you gotta pick a major. So  on a dare  I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying  because  let's face it  you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Ross, Oh  please. I am not singing to your stomach  ok?
Ross, Shh!  Here we come  walkin' down the street  get the funniest looks from  everyone we meet. Hey  hey!  Hey  uh  did you just feel that?
Ross, Does it always  uh--?
Ross,  Hey  hey  you're my baby  and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel  and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ross,  Hey  hey  I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
Joey, Nope  not that one.
Monica, Can you go any faster with that?
Joey, Hey  I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Monica, Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Chandler,  For an emergency just like this.
Rachel,  All right  listen  smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon  I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not.
Monica, I swear you said you had the keys.
Rachel, No  I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys  and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Phoebe, Ooh  ok  that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Monica, Why would I have the keys?
Rachel, Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Monica, But I didn't.
Rachel, Well  you should have.
Monica, Why?
Rachel, Because!
Monica, Why?
Rachel, Because!
Monica, Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know  everyone wants a different kind of potatoes  so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo  no  no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions  and Mario gets his tots  and it's my first Thanksgiving  and it's all burned  and  and I... I...
Chandler, Ok  Monica  only dogs can hear you now  so  look  the door's open. Here we go.
Monica, Well  the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined  potatoes are ruined  potatoes are ruined.
Ross, Here we come  walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Monica, No  it doesn't  does it? But you wanted lumps  Ross?  Well  here you go  buddy  ya got one.
Rachel, Oh  god  this is great! The plane is gone  so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Joey, Hey  we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Monica, Oh  really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Joey, You call that delicious?
Monica, Stop it  stop it  stop it!
Chandler, Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Phoebe, Ooh.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
Joey, I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Monica, Ooh  Ugly Naked Dancing!
Phoebe, It's nice that he has someone.
Chandler, Shall I carve?
Rachel, By all means.
Chandler, Ok  who wants light cheese  and who wants dark cheese?
Ross, I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Monica,  Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Joey, Oh  I will.
Phoebe, Ooh  you guys have to make a wish.
Monica, Make a wish?
Phoebe, Come on  you know  Thanksgiving. Ooh  you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Joey, The bigger half.
Chandler, I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here  ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned  but for me  this has been really great  you know  I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway  I was just thinking  I mean  if you'd gone to Vail  and if you guys'd been with your family  if you didn't have syphilis and stuff  we wouldn't be all together  you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Ross, And hey  here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel, And a crappy New Year.
Chandler, Here  here!
Ross, Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
Monica, W-wait. What is that?
Ross, 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica, No  no  I don't.
Rachel, Oh  he is precious! Where did you get him?
Ross, My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe, That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler, Hey  that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
Monica, Ross  is he gonna live with you  like  in your apartment?
Ross, Yeah. I mean  it's been kinda quiet since Carol left  so...
Monica, Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross, Nah  I dunno... I think you reach a certain age  having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry  that's  that's 'pathet'  which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
Phoebe, So you guys  I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide  and one about a snowman.
Chandler, Might wanna open with the snowman.
Monica, So  how'd it go?
Joey, Ahhhhhh  I didn't get the job.
Ross, How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Joey, I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly  it's all political.
Monica, So what are you gonna be?
Joey, Ah  I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face  y'know?
Rachel, Hey  do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee  what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
Chandler, Nothing for you  you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man  I'm talking loud!
Rachel, Well  for your information  Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year  so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Phoebe, Yeah  you wish!
Chandler, It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year  no dates  we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Chandler, Y'know  I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Rachel, Phoebe  you're on.
Phoebe, Oh  oh  good.
Rachel,  Okay  hi. Ladies and gentlemen  back by popular demand  Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
Phoebe,  Thanks  hi. Um  I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.  
Phoebe, 
Phoebe, 
Phoebe, Well  c'mon  if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing  then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Chandler,  That guy's going home with a note!
Phoebe, Could you speak up please?
Phoebe, Okay  we're gonna take a short break. 
Joey, Hey  that guy's going home with more than a note!
Ross, Come here  Marcel. Sit here. 
Rachel, Pheebs  I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God  by my sixth date with Paolo  I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Ross, Just a smidge.
Phoebe, David's like  y'know  Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Monica, I think it's romantic.
Phoebe, Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Rachel, Yeah!
Phoebe, Well  he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except  except he-he's smarter  and gentler  and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night  and night and day... and special occasions...
Chandler, Wait a minute  wait a minute  I see where this is going  you're gonna ask him to New Year's  aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Phoebe, No  no  no  no  no  no. Yeah  could I just?
Chandler, Yeah  'cause I already asked Janice.
Monica, What?!
Ross, C'mon  this was a pact! This was your pact!
Chandler, I snapped  okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Monica, Yeah  but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Chandler, I'm not saying it was a good idea  I'm saying I snapped!
Joey, Hi. Hi  sorry I'm late.
Chandler, Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Joey, Nice shoes  huh? 
Chandler, Aah  y'killing me!
Monica, Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Ross, Okay  look  he's not gonna hurt them  right?
Monica, Do you always have to bring him here?
Ross, I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean  and he- he threw some faeces...
Chandler, Y'know  if you're gonna work late  I could look in on him for you.
Ross, Oh  that'd be great! Okay  but if you do  make sure it seems like you're there to see him  okay  and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Chandler, Okay  but if he asks  I'm not going to lie.
Phoebe, Okay  alright  I have a question  then.
Phoebe, Um  were you planning on kissing me ever?
Phoebe, Sure.
Phoebe, Oh  David  I  I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean  you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  oh  I'm sure of it. You should just do it  just sweep and throw me.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  right now.
Phoebe, Okay  now you're just kinda tidying.
Phoebe, I can hop. 
Ross, So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Monica, I'm sorry  okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody  and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Chandler, Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
Monica, Yeah.
Joey, You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Chandler, I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Rachel,  Okay  here we go...
Joey, Ooh ooh ooh ooh  there's no room for milk!
Rachel,  There. Now there is.
Ross, Okay  so on our no-date evening  three of you now have dates.
Joey, Uh  four.
Ross, Four.
Rachel, Five.
Ross, Five. 
Rachel, Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Joey, Yeah  and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Ross, Okay  so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Rachel, Oh  c'mon. We'll have  we'll have a big party  and no-one'll know who's with who.
Ross, Hey  y'know  this is so not what I needed right now.
Monica, What's the matter?
Ross, Oh  it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out  y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Chandler, That's so weird  I had such a blast with him the other night.
Ross, Really.
Chandler, Yeah  we played  we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
Ross, What  uh... what juggling thing?
Chandler, With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
Ross, No.
Chandler, Y'know  it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Phoebe, Oh  hi Max! Hey  do you know everybody?
Phoebe, No  no  he hasn't been around.
Phoebe, Minsk?
Phoebe, I know where Minsk is.
Phoebe, So when  when do you leave?
Phoebe, Hello?
Phoebe, Hi.
Phoebe, Um  well  Max told me about Minsk  so  congratulations! This is so exciting!
Phoebe, Oh  you're not going?  Oh  why?
Phoebe, So-so you're really not going?
Phoebe, Oh don't do that.
Phoebe, Oh no no.
Phoebe, Oh  but I can't do that-
Phoebe, It's your thing  and-
Phoebe, Okay  um  stay.
Phoebe, Stay.
Phoebe, Getting so good at that! 
Chandler, You remember Janice.
Monica, Vividly.
Monica, Hi.
Joey, Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
Ross, Par-tay!
Monica, That thing is not coming in here.
Ross, 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something  if I showed up here with my new girlfriend  she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Monica, I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Ross, Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Monica, Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Ross, Thank you.  C'mon  Marcel  whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright  I'll  uh... catch up with you later.
Monica, Oh my gosh! Rachel  honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Rachel, Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
Phoebe, And then... your face is bloated?
Rachel, No. Okay. I was at the airport  getting into a cab  when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up  and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?
Joey, Wow  that's  uh  dirty.
Joey, Hey  kids...
Ross,  Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me  but at least check in.
Chandler,  But you found me!
Chandler, Kill me. Kill me now.
Monica, Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Joey,  Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
Chandler, Alright  Janice  that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey  Janice  when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Chandler, I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Chandler, Oh  will you give me the thing. 
Phoebe, Hi  Max!
Phoebe, Are you alright?
Phoebe, You're going to Minsk.
Phoebe, Oh  you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
Phoebe, Oh yes  yes  yes you can. Just say  um  'Phoebe  my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say  um  'it's tearing me apart  but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
Phoebe, Ooh  sorry. Um  and  and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And  um  and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
Phoebe, And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
Joey, There y'go  kids.
Chandler,  And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. 
Joey, You seen Sandy?
Chandler, Ooh. Uh  I don't know how to tell you this  but she's in Monica's bedroom  getting it on with Max  that scientist geek. Ooh  look at that  I did know how to tell you.
Rachel, Vrrbddy  the bll is drrbing.
Rachel, The bll is drrbing!
Chandler, And the moment of joy is upon us.
Joey, Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Phoebe, Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Monica, Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
Chandler, Y'know  I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz  but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 
Phoebe, I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Rachel, I can't kiss anyone.
Monica, So I'm kissing everyone?
Joey, Nonono  you can't kiss Ross  that's your brother.
Ross, Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Chandler, Alright  somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me  it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
Joey, Alrightalrightalright.  There.
Ross,  I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there  changing his diapers  pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Rachel, ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Phoebe, Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica, Why?
Phoebe, Just wanna check my horoscope  see if it was right.
Monica, Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now  but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Phoebe, Where?  Ooh  come to Momma.
Monica, He's coming. Be cool  be cool  be cool.
Phoebe, We should do something. Whistle.
Monica, We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe, Come on  do it.
Monica, No!
Phoebe, Do it!
Monica, No!
Phoebe, Do it do it do it!
Monica,  Woo-woo!
Phoebe, I can't believe you did that!
Monica, Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean  what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound  I must have you now'?
Phoebe, I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello  Coma Guy. GET UP  YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica, Phoebe  what are you doing?
Phoebe, Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica, I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean  even sleeping  he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe, Yeah  but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Monica, Okay  he's a lawyer  who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Phoebe, Oh! And  he's the kinda guy who  when you're talking  he's listening  y'know  and not saying 'Yeah  I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica, I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe, I know.
Chandler, Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Monica, He doesn't have anyone.
Phoebe, Yeah  we-we feel kinda responsible.
Joey, I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Rachel, Oh  she's coming up! She's coming up! 
Chandler, Y'know  we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime  HBO  and Cinemax.
Rachel, No way  forget it.
Joey, C'mon  she's your mom!
Chandler, Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty  thirty times! No?
Rachel, Chandler  I gotta tell you  I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean  this is so cool!
Chandler, Yeah  well  you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Ross, C'mon  Chandler  I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Chandler, You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross, Oh  please...
Rachel, Oh  hi sweetie. 
Ross, When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Monica, Last night.
Ross, Ah  so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but  phew.
Phoebe, Hey hey hey! She's on!
Phoebe, Your mom was arrested?
Chandler, Shhh  busy beaming with pride.
Chandler, Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Chandler, THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Chandler, This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Chandler, ...And then he burst into flames.
Monica, Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh  teams played sports.
Phoebe, What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Monica, Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe, Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica, Waaay too special.
Chandler, Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler, Well  I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross,  What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Chandler, I know I am.
Monica, Yeah.
Phoebe, I'm in.
Ross, Uh  I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Rachel, Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late  we  uh  kinda just  y'know  lost track of time.
Ross, ...But a man can change. 
Ross, Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel, Mrs. Bing  I have to tell you  I've read everything you've ever written. No  I mean it! I mean  when I read Euphoria at Midnight  all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Chandler, Myyy mother  ladies and gentlemen.
Ross, Yeah  I'm fine  I'm fine. 
Ross, Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Ross, No. It's the one he's licking.
Ross, You're good.
Ross, The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Ross, When?
Ross, The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Ross, Please.
Ross, Right.
Ross, Uh-oh...
Joey, Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Ross, Hey  is Chandler here?
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Okay  uh  about last night  um  Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay  'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler  I mean  it was just a kiss  right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Joey, Right. No big deal.
Ross, Okay.
Joey, In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Ross, What code?
Joey, You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay  maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom  never a mom!
Chandler, What are you guys doing out here?
Ross, Uh.. uh.. Well  Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But  um  apparently  somebody overslept.
Joey, Yeah  well  you don't have your racket.
Ross, No  no I don't  because it's being restrung  somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Joey, Yeah  well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler, Okay  you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 
Ross, Okay  I'm scum  I'm scum.
Joey, Ross  how could you let this happen?
Ross, I don't know  God  I... well  it's not like she's a regular mom  y'know? She's  she's sexy  she's...
Joey, You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ross, Well... not in the same way...
Joey, I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day  alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Ross, Okay  I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, What're you guys doing out here?
Ross, Well  not playing raquetball!
Joey, He forgot to leave his grip size!
Ross, He didn't get the goggles!
Rachel, Well sounds like you two have issues.
Rachel, Goodbye  baby.
Ross, Do they wait for me to do this?
Joey, So are you gonna tell him?
Ross, Why would I tell him?
Joey, How about 'cause if you don't  his mother might.
Ross, Oh...
Monica,  What are you guys doing here?
Joey, Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Monica, ...What did I ask?
Monica, Hi.
Phoebe, Hi.
Monica, What are you doing here?
Phoebe, Nothing  I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know  after the uh... that I.. y'know  so what are you doing here?
Monica, I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Phoebe, No.  No! No! ...So  um  do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Monica, How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Phoebe, Really? Not even to  um  change his PAJAMAS?! 
Chandler, Oh my God.
Ross, You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Chandler, I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross, Yeah  um  I don't know if you noticed  but he had a lot to drink  and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this  I did it  it was me  I'm sorry  I kissed your mom.
Chandler, What?
Ross, I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo  and I think I had too much tequila  and Nora- um  Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice  y'know  and- But nothing happened  nothing- Ask Joey  Joey  uh  came in-
Chandler,  You knew about this?
Joey, Uh... y'know  knowledge is a tricky thing.
Chandler, I spent the entire day with you  why didn't you tell me?!
Joey, Hey  hey  hey  you're lucky I caught them when I did  or else who knows what woulda happened.
Ross, Thanks  man  big help.
Chandler,  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross, I wasn't- I mean  I-
Chandler, Y'know  of all my friends  no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
Ross, I know-
Chandler, I can't believe you did this. 
Ross, Chandler-
Joey, Me neither  y'know what-
Chandler, I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey, What are you mad at me for?!
Ross, Chandler-
Chandler, You gotta let me slam the door! 
Joey,  Chandler  I didn't kiss her  he did!  See what happens when you break the code?
Ross, Joey-
Joey, Ah!  Huh? 
Monica, Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Monica,  'A Woman Undone  by Rachel Karen Green'.
Rachel, Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now  do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Monica,  Yeah  I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Phoebe,  Hey Rach.
Rachel, Hey.
Phoebe, Hello.
Monica, Hello.
Phoebe, Going to the hospital tonight?
Monica, No  you?
Phoebe, No  you?
Monica, You just asked me.
Phoebe, Okay  maybe it was a trick question.  Um  Rachel can we do this now?
Rachel, Okay.  I am so hot!
Joey,  Now  here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Ross, I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Joey, C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant  that's all.
Rachel,  Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe, Thanks. Hi  um  'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met  who's  um  come to be very important to me.  'Kay. 
Rachel,  Okay  that was Phoebe Buffay  everybody. Woo!
Chandler, What was that?
Ross, Oh  uh  Phoebe just started a...
Chandler, Yeah  I believe I was talking to Joey  alright there  Mother-Kisser? 
Joey,  Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
Ross, Chandler  can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me  I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Chandler, Yes  well  I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Ross, Okay  well  if she always behaves like this  why don't you say something?
Chandler, Because it's complicated  it's complex- Hey  you kissed my mom!
Ross,  We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Chandler, That's very funny. We done now?
Ross, No! Okay  you mean  you're not gonna talk to her  you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Chandler, That would be no. Look  just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me  you can't talk to her.
Ross, Okay  'you' can't  or  you can't?  Okay  that's my finger.  That's  that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!
Phoebe, Alright  whadyou do with him?
Monica, Oh! You're awake!
Phoebe, Look at you! How  how do you feel?
Monica, You look good!
Monica, Oh  sorry.
Phoebe, I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica, I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe, Well  we both have.
Phoebe, Well  actually it's just from me.
Monica, I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe, You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica, I read to you.
Phoebe, I sang.  Hah!
Monica, Oh  my pleasure.
Phoebe, You're welcome.
Phoebe, What  that's it?
Monica," ""See you around?"""
Monica," Oh  I don't know. Maybe  um  ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"""
Phoebe, I don't think you mean that.
Monica," This is so typical. Y'know  we give  and we give  and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day  y'know  it's just  you wake up  and ""See you around!"" Let's go  Phoebe."
Phoebe, Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Chandler, No  just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Chandler, You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Chandler, Really stupid.
Chandler, Yeah. No. No...
Ross, Ah  the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey, Shh. He did it. He told her off  and not just about the kiss  about everything.
Ross, You're kidding.
Joey," No  no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
Ross, Wow!
Joey," Then she came back with ""The question is  when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
Ross," 'Kay  wait a minute  are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
Joey, That makes more sense.
Ross, So  what's going on now?
Joey, I dunno  I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh  wait  wait  wait. 
Ross, Whaddya see?
Joey, Hard to tell  they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait  wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No  no they're not  they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Chandler, Yeah  okay.
Chandler, Nice save.
Ross,  Mrs. Bing.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, You mean that?
Chandler, Yeah  why not.  So I told her.
Ross, Yeah? How'd it go?
Chandler, Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Ross, Well  howdya feel?
Chandler, Pretty good! I told her.
Ross, Well  see? So  maybe it wasn't such a bad idea  y'know  me kissing your mom  uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Rachel, Okay. Now this is just the first chapter  and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh  oh  and on page two  he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica, What's a 'niffle'?
Joey, You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel, Alright  alright  so I'm not a great typist...
Ross, Wait  did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya  you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Rachel, Alright  that's it! Give it back! That's it!
Chandler, No-no-no-no  we're done.
Monica, Aunt Syl  stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna  I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well  the meat's only every third layer  maybe you could scrape.
Joey, Ross  did you really read all these baby books?
Ross, Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus  no compass  and I can find my way out of there like that! 
Phoebe, Ooh  this is cool...it says in some parts of the world  people actually eat the placenta. 
Chandler, And  we're done with the yogurt. 
Phoebe,  Sorry. 
Monica, Aunt Syl  I did this as a favor  I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk  Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Joey, Hey Ross  listen  you know that right now  your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy!
Ross,  Hello!
Joey,  How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian? 
Rachel, Honey  you can say it  Poconos  Poconos  it's like Poc-o-nos 
Monica, So  did I hear Poconos?
Rachel, Yes  my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Phoebe, Woo-hoo  first weekend away together!
Monica, Yeah  that's a big step.
Rachel, I know...
Chandler,  Ah  it's just a weekend  big deal!
Ross, Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling  huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Rachel, I mean  we are way past the fling thing  I mean  I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books  you know? I mean  when I'm with him  I'm totally  totally...
Ross, ...nauseous  I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do  huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
Joey, I love babies  with their little baby shoes  and their little baby toes  and their little baby hands...
Chandler, Ok  you're going to have to stop that  forever!
Joey, Need a new table.
Chandler, You think?
Ross, Hey  hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books  and Monica sends her love  along with this lasagna.
Ross,  I'm pretty sure that it is...
Ross,  Oh  tell me  tell me  is everything  uhh....?
Ross, Oh  that's great  that is great! 
Ross, Hey  when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Ross,  Of course it's your friend Tanya. 
Ross,  The sex?  Um  I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together  when you throw in Tanya   yaw...
Ross, Oh  you know the sex of the baby? Oh  oh-oh-oh!
Ross, No  no  no  no  no  I don't want to know  absolutely not. I think  you know  I think you should know until you look down there  and say  oop  there it is!  Or isn't...
Ross, Susan...
Ross, Yes  we did  everything's A-OK!
Ross,  Oh  hey hey hey  ho ho ho  hello  guy who doesn't want to know  standing right here!
Ross, Ok  what  what...ok  what did we think it was going to be?
Ross,  No  no  no I don't want to know  don't want to know. Ok  you know  I should probably  I should probably just go.
Ross, No problem  ok  mmmwa  oh  mmmwa  Susan... 
Ross,  Uh  never mind  I don't want to know. 
Chandler, Ok  so it's just because it was my table  I have to buy a new one?
Joey, That's the rule.
Chandler, What rule? There's no rule  if anything  you owe me a table!
Joey, How'd you get to that?
Chandler, Well  I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
Joey, You knew about that?
Chandler, Well  let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Joey, Ok  ok  How about if we split it?
Chandler, What do you mean  like  buy it together?
Joey, Yeah
Chandler, You think we're ready for something like that?
Joey, Why not?
Chandler, Well  it's a pretty big commitment  I mean  what if one of us wants to move out?
Joey, Why  are you moving out?
Chandler, I'm not moving out.
Joey, You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Chandler, Yeah  yeah  it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Joey, Aw  I know all about Kip!
Chandler, It's just that we bought a hibachi together  and then he ran off and got married  and things got pretty ugly.
Joey, Well  let me ask you something  was Kip a better roommate than me?
Chandler, Aw  don't do that
Phoebe, Ok  thanks. 
Phoebe, Oh  Paolo  hi  what are you doing here?
Phoebe, Well  Racquela's right  yeah!
Phoebe, Oh  okay  I don't know what you just said  so let's get started.
Phoebe, Um  that's really your decision  I mean  some people prefer  you know  to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
Rachel,  I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean  I couldn't not know  I mean  if  if the doctor knows  and Carol knows  and Susan knows....
Monica, And Monica knows...
Ross, Wha  heh  how could you know  I don't even know!
Monica, Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna  I asked  she told me.
Joey, So what's it gonna be? 
Ross, Wait—oh—hey—huh  oh great now he knows  and I don't know!
Monica, I'm sorry  I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Joey, Or an uncle...
Ross, Hi Pheebs!
Rachel, Pheebs!
Phoebe, Fine!
Monica, Phoebe  what's the matter?
Phoebe, Nothing  I'm sorry  I'm just  I'm out of sorts.
Rachel, Oh  right  that's me!
Joey, Hey  Chandler  that table place closes at 7  come on.
Chandler, Fine. 
Monica, Phoebe  what is it?
Phoebe, All right  you know Paolo?
Ross, I'm familiar with his work  yes...
Phoebe, Well  he made a move on me.
Joey, Whoa  store will be open tomorrow!
Chandler, More coffee over here  please!
Monica, Well  what happened?
Phoebe, Well  he came in for a massage  and everything was fine until. 
Ross, My God.
Monica, Are you sure?
Phoebe, Oh yeah  I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. 
Monica, Was it...?
Phoebe, Oh  boy scouts could have camped under there.
Rachel," ""Ooo "" what?"
Phoebe, Uma Thurman.
Monica, Oh!
Ross, The actress!
Ross, Thanks Rach.
Chandler, So what are you gonna do?
Ross, You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation  as a friend  as a woman  I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 
Chandler, Oh  yeah  you have to tell her.
Joey, Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Phoebe, She is gonna hate me.
Ross, Yeah  well...
Joey, Will you pick one  just pick one! Here  how about that one? 
Chandler, That's patio furniture!
Joey," So what  like people are gonna come in and think  ""Uh-oh  I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
Chandler,  What about the birds?
Joey," I don't know  birds just don't say  ""Hello  sit here  eat something."""
Chandler, You pick one.
Joey, All right  how about the ladybugs?
Chandler, Oh  so  forget about the birds  but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Joey, Fine  you want to get the birds  get the birds!
Chandler, Not like that  I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe, Are you moving out?
Rachel, No  these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
Phoebe, Um  um  Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Rachel, Well  sure...just a sec  though  'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Phoebe, Oh!  Ok  um  ok  um 
Rachel, Oh  Pheebs  Pheebs...
Phoebe, Ok  um   we haven't known each other for that long a time  and  um  there are three things that you should know about me. One  my friends are the most important thing in my life  two  I never lie  and three  I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. 
Rachel,  Ok  thanks Pheebs  Oh my God  why have I never tasted these before?!
Phoebe, Oh  I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
Rachel, All right  well  you're right  these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Phoebe, Which proves that I never lie.
Rachel, I guess you don't.
Phoebe, Paolo made a pass at me.
Chandler, So  what do you think?
Ross, I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Chandler, I know!
Monica, So how does this work  you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Joey, Who cares  we'll eat at the sink! Come on  let's play!
Monica, Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
Phoebe, Are you okay?
Rachel, I need some milk.
Phoebe, Ok  I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?
Rachel," No...oh  I feel so stupid! Oh  I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh  Paolo  he's so great  he makes me feel so..."" Oh  God  I'm so embarrassed!"
Phoebe, I'm so embarrassed  I'm the one he hit on!
Rachel, Pheebs  if I had never met him this never would have happened!
Phoebe, No  wait  oh  what are we sorry about?
Rachel, I don't know...right  he's the pig!
Phoebe, Such a pig!
Rachel, Oh  God  he's such a pig 
Phoebe, Oh he's like a...
Rachel, He's like a big disgusting...
Phoebe, ...like a...
Rachel, ...pig...pig man!
Phoebe, Yes  good! Ok...
Rachel,  Oh  but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
Phoebe,  Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous  and he's charming  and when he looks at you...
Rachel, Ok  Ok  Pheebs...
Phoebe, The end.
Rachel, Oh  God...
Phoebe, Should I not have told you?
Rachel, No  no  trust  me  it's  it's  it's much better that I know. Uh  I just liked it better before it was better...
Phoebe, I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now  so...
Monica, We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. 
Ross,  Ah...ooh! Well  looks like  uh  we kicked your butts.
Joey, No-no  she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Ross, Come on  two on one.
Chandler, What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy  it's time for you to swoop in!
Ross, What  now?
Joey, Yes  now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there  the first guy Rachel sees is you  She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like  like the anti-Paolo!
Chandler, My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces  and then you usher in the age of Ross! 
Ross,  How's it going?
Monica," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony  now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving    Ok  that is either  ""How could you?"" or  ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!"
Phoebe, Ooh!
Phoebe, Oh  ok bye-bye.
Monica, Paolo  I really hate you for what you did to Rachel   but I still have five of these  so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Ross, Paolo  I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... 
Phoebe, Oh  just look at her... 
Ross, Oh you guys  I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Monica, Oh  you're right.
Ross,  ...and I really think it should be me.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, You all right?
Rachel, Ooh  I've been better...
Ross, Come here.  Listen  you deserve so much better than him...you know  I mean  you  you  you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Rachel, Oh  Ross...
Ross, What?
Rachel, I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy  I don't want to think about another guy  I don't even want to be near another guy. 
Ross, Huh.
Rachel, Oh Ross  you're so great!
Ross, Ohhhh 
Monica, Ooh...hey honey  are you all right?
Rachel, Oh...
Phoebe, You ok?
Rachel, ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Phoebe, Yep!
Ross, See  Rach  uh  see  I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Rachel, No. I just need to be by myself for a while  you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Ross, Uh  no  no  see  because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Rachel, No  I know  I know  and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Ross,  What?
Rachel, What?
Ross, I-I'm  I'm having a boy?
Rachel, Uh...no. No  no  in fact  you're not having a boy.
Ross, Wha-I'm having  I'm having a boy!  Huh  am I having a boy?
Ross, I'm having a boy! Oh  I'm having a boy!
Chandler, Wha-
Joey, Wha-
Ross, I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, I'm having a son. Um...
Monica, Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Monica, Where are you guys going? Come on  one more game!
Joey, Uh  it's 2:30 in the morning!
Chandler, Yeah  get out!
Monica, You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on  I'll only use my left hand  huh? Come on  wussies!  All right  ok  I gotta go. I'm going   and I'm gone.
Chandler,  One more game?
Joey, Oh yeah!
Rachel, That is it! You just barge in here  you don't knock
Chandler, I'm sorry!
Rachel, You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Chandler, Rachel  wait  wait.
Rachel, No  you wait! This is ridiculous!
Chandler, Can I just say one thing?
Rachel, What? What?!
Chandler, That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Rachel, Oh!!
Phoebe, Oh  honey  honey  tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are  like  other things. Y'know? Like  the phone rings and she takes a shower.
Phoebe, Oops!
Phoebe, Thanks. Okay  now go away so we can talk about you.
Phoebe, Isn't he great?
Rachel, He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
Phoebe, I know  I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink  he's not too shrinky  y'know?
Monica, So  you think you'll do it on his couch?
Phoebe, Oh  I don't know  I don't know. I think that's a little weird  y'know? Vinyl.
Rachel, Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Chandler, Oh  yes  could I have one of those. 
Rachel, No  I'm sorry  we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, No  she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Ross, You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Chandler, It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Rachel, Okay  okay  could we change the subject  please?
Phoebe, Yeah  'cause hello  these are not her boobies  these are her breasts.
Rachel, Okay  Pheebs  I was hoping for more of a change.
Chandler, Y'know  I don't know why you're so embarrassed  they were very nice boobies.
Rachel, Nice? They were nice. I mean  that's it? I mean  mittens are nice.
Chandler, Okaaay   rock  hard place  me.
Chandler, Whoah whoah  back up there  Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Chandler, Huh.
Chandler, Uhhuh  how did you know that?
Joey, Hey you guys. Hey  you all know my dad  right?
Monica, Hey  how long are you in the city?
Phoebe, Oh  this is my friend Roger.
Joey, Dad  dad. 
Joey,  Hey Ma. Listen  I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida  and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
Joey, Sure. So how long you been... 
Joey, Since then?!
Joey, ...I d'know.
Joey, You're one to talk. 
Joey, Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Joey, It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy  working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!
Rachel, I know  I mean  why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
Chandler,  What?  What?
Rachel, Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
Ross, Alright  alright. We're all adults here  there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies  I think  uh  you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
Chandler, Y'know  I don't see that happening?
Rachel, C'mon  he's right. Tit for tat.
Chandler, Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
Monica, Hello?
Phoebe,  It's Phoebe.
Monica, C'mon up.
Chandler,  Oh  good. Rog is here.
Joey, What's the matter with Rog?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Oh  it's nothing  it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Ross, What  so he was a little analytical. That's what he does  y'know? C'mon  he's not that bad.
Ross, Y'see  that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
Ross, Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
Monica, Wait-wait  go back to that sibling thing.
Ross, That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Monica, Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Phoebe, Isn't he good?
Ross, Nonono  thatthat's not what I was saying...
Monica, Y'know  all these years  I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Ross, Hey  I married a lesbian to make you look good!
Rachel, You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles  but it was the Weeble Play Palace  and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh  which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
Phoebe, Oh  okay. Feel better  Rachel  'kay?
Phoebe, Oh  okay. Listen  thanks for everything  Mon.
Monica, You're welcome.
Monica, Hate that guy! 
Joey, Night  you guys.
Chandler, Oh look  it's the woman we ordered.
Joey, Hey. Can  uh  can we help you?
Joey, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Chandler, Uh  Joey's having an embolism  but I'd go for a Nip  y'know?
Chandler, Joey  if I go first  I wanna be looking for my keys.
Joey, Dad  Ronni's here.
Chandler, So  who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Joey, Who-ah-ho.
Joey, No you won't.
Joey, If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Joey, That's right  mister  and I don't care how old you are  as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Joey, Now dad  you'll be in my room  Ronni uh  you can stay in Chandler's room.
Chandler," C'mon  I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks  it's late."""
Joey, Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow  you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Joey, Well  either you break it off with Ronni
Joey, Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Joey, I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Chandler, Hey  Kicky. What're you doing?
Joey, Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Chandler, Well  you're gonna.
Joey, I've been thinking. Y'know  about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Chandler, Are they end to end  or tall like pancakes?
Joey, Y'know what I mean  about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured  when the right one comes along  I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance  y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad  thinking...
Chandler, Hey  you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business  did you cave?
Joey, No.
Chandler," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy  but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along  you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks  I'm married."""
Joey, You really think so?
Chandler, Yeah. I really do.
Joey, Thanks  Chandler. 
Chandler, Get off!
Monica, Hi...May I help you?
Monica, Okay...who are you?
Monica, Oh  c'mon in.
Rachel, Hi  I'm Rachel.
Rachel, Bathroom's up there.
Rachel, Hey  listen  Ronni  how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Rachel, Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts  it's peepee time.  Hey  Mr. Trib.
Rachel, Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Joey,  What's the matter with you?!
Rachel, I thought it was Chandler!
Chandler,  What? What?
Rachel, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Chandler, Sorry  my my thing was in there with me.
Phoebe, Hey.
Monica, How's it going?
Phoebe, Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Phoebe, So what's going on?
Monica, Nothing  um  it's just  um... It's Roger.
Ross, I dunno  there's just something about...
Chandler, Basically we just feel that he's...
Rachel, We hate that guy.
Ross, We're sorry  Pheebs  we're sorry.
Phoebe, Uh-huh. Okay. Okay  don't you think  maybe  though  it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Rachel, We're sorry.
Joey, Ma! What're you doing here?
Joey, Oww! Big ring!
Joey, Hold on  you-you knew?
Joey, So then how could you I mean  how could you?!
Joey, Ma  I don't mean to be disrespectful  but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean  what about you?
Joey, I'm...happy...for you?
Joey, Ma  I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
Joey, Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Joey, With this ring?  No contest.
Phoebe, Nothing  nothing.
Phoebe, It's  I mean  it's nothing  I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that  um  they don't.
Phoebe, But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Phoebe, Intense and creepy.
Phoebe, But I don't. Me  Phoebe.
Phoebe, You're not? See  that's why you're so great!
Monica, So you talked to your dad  huh.
Joey, Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted  she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does  and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Rachel, Wow.
Chandler, Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Ross, So Joey  you okay?
Joey, Yeah  I guess. It's just parents  after a certain point  you gotta let go. Even if you know better  you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Rachel, Just think  in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
Chandler, If I turn into my parents  I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys  or... I'll end up like my mom.
Phoebe,  Hey.
Monica, How's it going?
Phoebe, Oh  okay  except I broke up with Roger.
Phoebe, Yeah  right.
Rachel, What happened?
Phoebe, I don't know  I mean  he's a good person  and he can be really sweet  and in some ways I think he is so right for me  it's just... I hate that guy!
Phoebe, Hey  Joey. What's going on?
Joey, Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. 
Monica, Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Joey, Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Monica, Hello  Joey.
Joey, I'm tellin' you Ross  she wants you.
Ross, She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Chandler, Any contact?
Ross, She lent me an egg once.
Joey, You're in!
Ross, Aw  right.
Ross, Hey. 
Chandler, Come on  Ross  you gotta get back in the game here  ok? The Rachel thing's not happening  your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
Joey, Excuse me  could we get an egg over here  still in the shell? Thanks.
Ross, An egg?
Joey," Yeah  you're gonna go up to her and say  ""Here's your egg back  I'm returning your egg."""
Chandler, I think it's winning.
Ross, I think it's insane.
Chandler, She'll love it. Go with the egg  my friend.
Joey, Think it'll work?
Chandler, No  it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Monica, You can not do this.
Rachel, Do what  do what?
Monica, Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Rachel, No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe, 'Cause he was creepy  and mean  and a little frightening... alright  still  it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Monica, But Phoebe  you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Rachel, Well  what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
Joey, Actually  tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Chandler, Oh  uh  listen  about tonight...
Joey, No  no  no  don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Chandler, Yes  I know  but her friend sounds like such a...
Joey, Pathetic mess? I know  but—come on  man  she's needy  she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin'  cha-ching!  Thanks. Look  you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Ross, Hi. She said yes.
Chandler, Yes! Way to go  man!  Still got the egg  huh?
Joey,  How do I look?
Chandler, Oh  uh  I... don't... care.  Ok  now  remember  no trading. You get the pretty one  I get the mess.
Chandler, ...And what did you bring?
Chandler, Janice?
Chandler,  Hey  it's Janice.
Chandler, Ok  I'm makin' a break for it  I'm goin' out the window.
Joey, No  no  no  don't! I've been waitin' for like  forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Chandler, Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Joey,  Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous  and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Chandler, I'm sorry  I'm sorry  you're right.  Come on  do it  do it  go  come on!!!
Rachel, Ok  ok  Roger was creepy  but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
Monica, Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  ""Was it good for you?"""
Monica," Yeah  well  I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy.  ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once."
Rachel, How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica, I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe, I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica, There's more beer  right?
Phoebe, Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle  you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Rachel, Pheebes  this woman is voluntarily bald.
Phoebe, Yeah. So  we can do it tomorrow night  you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Monica, Ok  well  what kind of ritual?
Phoebe, Ok. We can  um  we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Rachel, Or?
Phoebe, Or...or we can chant and dance around naked  you know  with sticks.
Monica, Burning's good.
Rachel, Burning's good. Yeah  I got stuff to burn.
Joey, Good for you.  Uh  quarters or rolls of quarters?
Chandler, That's OK.
Joey,  We can't do that.
Chandler,  What? What can't you do?
Joey, Uh  can I talk to you for a second  over there?
Joey, Uh  we might be leaving now.
Chandler," Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
Joey, She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is  but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Chandler, Ok  you can not do this to me.
Joey, You're right  I'm sorry. You're right.
Joey, I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry  Chandler.
Chandler, I hope she throws up on you.
Chandler, So...
Chandler, Oh  what a crappy night!
Chandler, Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
Chandler, Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Chandler, You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Chandler, That's right  each. Oh  and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...
Chandler, No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye  Janice.
Monica, Oh  Chandler  sorry.
Monica, Ohhh  Chandler  sorry! Hey  Janice.
Chandler, Ok  well  this was very special.
Monica, Rach  come see who's out here!
Rachel, Oh my god. Janice  hi!
Chandler, Janice is gonna go away now.
Monica, I'll be right back.
Rachel, Oh  Joey  look who it is.
Joey,  Whoa.
Chandler, Oh  good  Joey's home now.
Monica, Oh  hi  Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.
Ross, I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag  then  because of the whole um  seven dog years to one human year thing  then  when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles  he doesn't just lose three hours  he loses like a week and a half.
Ross, The blond woman is my ex-wife  and the woman touching her is her... close  personal friend.
Ross, If you wanna put a label on it.
Ross, Nope  nope  that's it.
Ross, Oh  and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!
Phoebe, Ok  so now we need  um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Monica, All I have is  is oregano and a Fresca.
Phoebe, Um  that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Rachel, Ok  Pheebs  you know what  if we had that  we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Monica, Can we just start throwing things in?
Phoebe, Ok  yeah  ok.  Oh  OK.
Rachel,  Ok  Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Phoebe, Ok  and I have the  uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Monica, Look  here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Rachel,  Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Monica, No.
Rachel, And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Monica, Hey  Rachel  isn't that stuff almost pure...
Chandler, How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Joey, I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Chandler, Oh  man. In my next life  I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Chandler, Hi  Just Janice.
Joey,  If you don't do it  I will.
Ross, So  um  what do you do for a living?
Ross, Now that is funny. Hey  do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's  she's alone now  and pregnant  and  and sad.
Ross, Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Ross, Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch  won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh  Kristen Riggs  this is Carol Willick. Carol  Kristin. Uh  Carol teaches sixth grade. And  Kristin  Kristin......does something that  funnily enough  wasn't even her major!
Monica, You know  it's a really funny story how this happened.
Rachel, Really?
Chandler, Is it loaded? Oh  little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.
Chandler, Ok  Janice. Janice. Hey  Janice. Look  there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
Chandler,  It is?
Chandler, Oh no  you see  actually it is.
Chandler, Oh  no I don't.
Chandler, I did  but...
Chandler, Call me!
Ross, You did so. I swear  I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?
Ross, Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Ross, Oh  god.  You know  this is still pretty hot. 
Ross," No  it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well  do I have to? I mean  I'm sitting here with this cute woman  and  and  and she's perfectly nice  and  but that there's  that's it. And um  and then I'm here talkin' to you  and  and it's easy  and it's fun  and  and I don't  I don't have to...You know  here's a wacky thought. Um  what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no  I know what you're gonna say  you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it  ok? Because  we're great together  you know. You can't deny it. Besides  you're carrying my baby. I mean  how perfect is that? But see  you know  you keep sayin' that  but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
Ross, No but  no but.
Ross, That's easy for you to say  you found one already.
Rachel, So  um  will you bring the truck?
Rachel, Oh  my god.
Phoebe, See  there you go  the cleansing works!
Monica, They're nice guys.
Rachel, Oh  they're firemen guys.
Rachel,  Coffee. 
Joey, Thank you.
Rachel,  Cappuccino. 
Ross, Grazie.
Rachel, And a nice hot cider for Monica. 
Monica, Aww  thank you.  Uh Rach?
Rachel, Yeah?
Monica, Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Rachel, Oh! That's why.  I'm sorry!
Chandler, Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say  that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Chandler, Oh  listen. If this is about those prank memos  I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.
Phoebe, Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has  like  this incredible news  so when he gets here  we could all act like  you know...
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Ross, What's going on?
Chandler, So  it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers  and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Chandler, So.... I quit.
Chandler, Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Monica, Yeah  Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Chandler, If I took this promotion  it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
Phoebe, So was it a lot more money?
Chandler, It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Rachel, ... the WENUS?
Chandler, Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
Rachel,  Oh. That WENUS.
Joey, So what're you going to do?
Chandler, I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Phoebe, Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway  he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Monica,  Um... hi there.
Phoebe, Hi!  Oh  yeah  no  I know. You're a chef. I know  and I thought of you first  but um  Chandler's the one who needs a job right now  so....
Chandler, Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Phoebe,  Yeah  yeah!
Monica, Well  what kind of food is he looking for?
Phoebe, Well  he wants to do some ecclectic  so he's looking for someone who can  you know  create the entire menu.
Monica,  Oh my God!
Phoebe, Yeah  I know!  So  what do you think?
Chandler, Thanks  Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Phoebe, OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what!
Chandler, Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Rachel, No. But don't worry  I'm sure they're still there.
Phoebe, Where are you going  Mr. Suity-Man?
Chandler," Well  I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman  career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo."""
Rachel, Career counselor?
Chandler, Hey  you guys all know what you want to do.
Rachel, I don't!
Chandler, Hey  you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know  you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
Ross," Ah  the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
Monica, Oh  I love my life  I love my life!
Phoebe, Ooh! Brian's Song!
Rachel, The meeting with the guy went great?
Monica, So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this  it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big  not too small. Just right.
Chandler, Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
Monica, So anyway  I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know  kind of like an audition. And Phoebe  he really wants you to be here  which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Rachel, What are you going to make?
Phoebe,  Yummy noises.
Rachel,  And Monica  what are you going to make?
Monica, I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Phoebe, Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh  you should definitely make that thing... you know  with the stuff?  You know  that thing... with the stuff...? OK  I don't know. 
Ross, Hey guys  does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Joey, How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak  it's free.
Ross, OK  ahem  hey  does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Chandler, Who are you going out with?
Phoebe, Oh  is this the bug lady?
Rachel,  Bzzzz.... I love you  Ross.
Ross, Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Rachel, So what are you guys going to do?
Ross, Oh  I just thought we could go out to dinner  and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
Chandler, And he's not speaking metaphorically.
Joey,  So.... back to your place...you thinking  maybe...  huh-huh?
Ross, Well  I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh.
Joey, I'm telling you  that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry  cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Ross, Celia  don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones  Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
Ross, Alright... 
Monica,  OK  try this salmon mousse.
Joey,  Mmmm. Good.
Monica, Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Joey, It's creamier.
Monica, Yeah  well  is that better?
Joey, I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish  Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down  y'know?
Rachel, My God! What happened to you?
Chandler," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests  intelligence tests  personality tests... and what do I learn?  ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
Phoebe, That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Chandler, Can you believe it? I mean  don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know  I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Rachel,  Oh Chandler  I know  I know... oh  hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Monica,  Here you go  maybe this'll cheer you up.
Chandler, Ooh  you know  I had a grape about five hours ago  so I'd better split this with you.
Monica, It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Chandler,  Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica,  Hello?  Oh  hi Wendy!  Yeah  eight o'clock.  What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK  great.  All right  I'll see you then. Bye. 
Phoebe, Ten dollars an hour for what?
Monica, Oh  I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rachel,  Waitressing?
Joey, Uh-oh.
Monica, Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Rachel, But  but?
Monica, But  you see  it's just... this night has to go just perfect  you know? And  well  Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Rachel, Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Chandler, You know  I don't mean to brag  but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche? 
Ross, OK.... um  a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Ross,  Wha... what  here?
Ross, Ah....
Ross,  Er.... um.....
Ross, Um... uh.... vulva.
Joey,  Vulva?
Ross, Alright  I panicked  alright? She took me by surprise. You know  but it wasn't a total loss. I mean  we ended up cuddling.
Joey,  Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Ross, Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy  you know?
Joey, What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Ross,  Please be kidding.
Joey, Why not? Come on! Just  just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross, OK.  I'm in my apartment...
Joey, ....yeah... what else?
Ross, That's it. I'm in my apartment  you're not there  we're not having this conversation. 
Joey,  Alright  look  I'll start  OK?
Ross, Joey  please.
Joey, Come on. Come on. Alright  ready  look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Ross,  Wow.
Joey, Alright  now you say something.
Ross, I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Joey, Come on! You like this woman  right?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, You want to see her again  right?
Ross, Sure.
Joey, Well if you can't talk dirty to me  how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Ross, OK  turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Joey,  Alright  alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ross, Ahem... I want.... OK  I want to... feel your... hot  soft skin with my lips.
Joey, There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Ross, I  er...
Ross, I want to take my tongue... and...
Ross, ....and....
Joey, Say it... say it!
Ross, ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Chandler, ....with??
Ross,  Funny story!
Joey, You're not going to believe this!
Chandler, It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Joey, Hey Chandler  while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Chandler, Again?
Joey, And again  and again  and again...  Hello?  And again.
Chandler,  Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah  I miss you too.  Yeah  it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home  you know?  Well  that's very generous  er  but look  this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look  Al  Al... I'm not playing hardball here  OK? This is not a negotiation  this is a rejection!  No! No! No  stop saying numbers! I'm telling you  you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday! 
Chandler, Well?
Phoebe,  Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh  this is a cube.
Chandler, Look at this! 
Phoebe, Oh! You have a window!
Chandler, Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
Phoebe, Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Chandler,  OK  that's enough of the view. Check this out  look at this. Sit down  sit down.
Phoebe,  OK.
Chandler, This is great!  Helen  could you come in here for a moment?
Chandler, Thank you Helen  that'll be all.
Chandler, Last time I do that  I promise.
Monica,  Wendy  we had a deal!  Yeah  you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! 
Rachel, Who was that?
Monica, Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Rachel, Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. 
Monica, Ten dollars an hour.
Rachel, No.
Monica, Twelve dollars an hour.
Rachel, Mon. I wish I could  but I've made plans to walk around.
Monica, You know  Rachel  when you ran out of your wedding  I was there for you. I put a roof over your head  and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.
Rachel, Done.
Rachel, Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Monica, Hi Steve!
Monica,  This is Rachel.
Phoebe,  Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know  I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of  OK  smells.
Monica, Oh  thank you. Would you like a tour?
Rachel, What's up?
Phoebe,  In the cab  on the way over  Steve blazed up a doobie.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Smoked a joint? You know  lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Rachel, OK  OK. I'm with you  Cheech. OK.
Rachel, Let me  let me get you some wine!
Monica, Yeah  I think we're ready for our first course.  OK  um  these are rot-shrimp ravioli  and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Monica, I'm so glad you liked them!
Monica, Oh  well... um  that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes  we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Rachel, Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Monica,  You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Monica, You know  if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Monica, No  we don't. 
Monica, Why don't you just have a seat here?  OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Monica, Give them to me.
Monica, No  give me the...
Monica,  That's it! Dinner is over!
Monica, What?
Monica, Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this  and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Joey, What a tool!
Rachel, You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Ross, Yeah!
Monica, I know... it's just... I thought this was  you know... it.
Ross, Look  you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Phoebe, Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Joey,  So  er... how did it go with Celia?
Ross, Oh  I was unbelievable.
Joey, All right  Ross!
Ross, I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean  there were characters  plot lines  themes  a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Joey, Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?
Ross, Well  ahem... you know  by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk  it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted  so uh...
Joey, You cuddled.
Ross, Yeah  which was nice.
Phoebe, You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Rachel, Maybe  but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
Joey, Yeah  where the hell is he?
Chandler,  Yes  Fran. I know what time it is  but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...  Oh  really  really  really? Well  let me tell you something... you will care about it  because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa....
Phoebe, How's this? 
Phoebe, Sorry. How about over here? 
Phoebe, See  that just means it's working. Does this hurt? 
Phoebe, What about this? 
Phoebe, There you go! 
Chandler, This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon  you’d be looking like a ham right about now.
Joey, There’s the waitress. Excuse me  Miss. Hello  Miss?
Chandler, It’s Phoebe! Hi!
Chandler, Wait  wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Joey, No  no... how come you are working here?
Chandler, Can we start over?
Ross," I don’t know whether he’s testing me  or just acting out  but my monkey is out of control. But  he keeps erasing the messages on my machine  ""supposedly"" by accident."
Rachel, No  yeah  I’ve done that.
Ross, And then  like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did  and peed all over the crossword.
Rachel, I’ve never done that.
Chandler, All right  now look at her and tell me she doesn’t look exactly like her sister.
Joey, I’m sayin’ I see a difference.
Chandler, They’re twins!
Joey, I don’t care. Phoebe’s Phoebe. Ursula’s... hot!
Chandler, You know that thing  when you and I talk to each other about things?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Let’s not do that any more.
Joey, Hey Pheebs  guess who we saw today.
Phoebe, Ooh  ooh  fun! Okay... um  Liam Neeson.
Joey, Nope.
Phoebe, Morly Safer.
Joey, Nope.
Phoebe, The woman who cuts my hair!
Monica, Okay  look  this could be a really long game.
Chandler, Your sister Ursula.
Phoebe,  Oh  really.
Chandler, Yeah  yeah  she works over at that place  uh...
Phoebe, Rift’s. Yeah  I know.
Chandler, Oh  you do? Because she said you guys haven’t talked in like years.
Phoebe, Hmmm? Yeah. So  um  is she fat?
Joey, Not from where I was standin’.
Phoebe,  where were you standing?
Rachel, Um  Pheebs  so  you guys just don’t get along?
Phoebe," It’s mostly just dumb sister stuff  you know  I mean  like  everyone always thought of her as the pretty one  you know... Oh  oh  she was the first one to start walking  even though I did it... later that same day. But  to my parents  by then it was like ""yeah  right  well what else is new?"""
Ross, Oh  Pheebs  I’m sorry  I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.
Chandler, Oh  and I’ve got Earth Science  but I'll catch you in Gym.
Rachel, So  is this just gonna be you and Carol?
Ross, No  Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads  we’ve got lesbians  the whole parenting team.
Rachel, Well  isn’t  isn’t that gonna be weird?
Ross, No  no.  I mean  it mighta been at first  but by now I  I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Monica, Ross  that’s my jacket.
Ross, I know.
Ross, Hi  um  I’m err   I’m Ross Geller  and err ah...  ..that’s  that’s my boy in there  and uh   this is Carol Willick  and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carol’s  just  com...  ..who’s next?
Ross, Susan is Carol’s  Carol’s  Carol’s  friend...
Ross, Like buddies.
Ross, You know how close women can get.
Ross, Although I was married to her.
Ross, Err  right.
Ross, A little.
Ross, Absolutely.  So  twins... hah! That’s like two births.  Ouch.
Chandler, And  to you too  Helen.
Chandler, Oh  okay. Send her in.
Chandler, Hi  Nina. Come on in.
Chandler, Uh  Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here  and little thing  you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Chandler, Well  it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Chandler, WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net...
Chandler, It’s not just that she’s cute  okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.
Ross, It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.
Monica, Ross  your little creature’s got the remote again.
Ross, Marcel  Marcel  give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel  you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Monica, Great.
Ross, Relax  I’ll fix it.
Rachel,"  Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel."""
Ross,  How did he do this?
Chandler,  So tell me something  is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Monica, Ah no  you see  someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.
Rachel," Well  someone was supposed to write ""Rach  take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?"
Chandler, Hey  where you been?
Joey, I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee  she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Chandler, Score.
Joey, She is so hot!
Chandler, Yeah  listen. Okay  before you do anything Joey-like  you might wanna run it by err... 
Joey, Pheebs?
Phoebe,  Yeah?
Joey, You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Phoebe, Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?
Joey, So that if we went out on a date  she’d be there.
Phoebe, Well  I mean  I’m not my sister’s  you know  whatever  and um... I mean  it’s true  we were one egg  once  but err  you know  we’ve grown apart  so  um... I don’t know  why not? Okay.
Joey, Cool  thanks.
Ross, You okay?
Phoebe, Yeah I’m fine.
Ross, You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Ross, Sorry.
Ross, Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s  where’s Carol?
Ross, No... No... No. I think I should stay  I think we should both know what’s going on.
Ross, Okay  I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Ross, I see. So what do you propose to do?
Ross, Flip me for it? No  no  no... heads  heads  heads!
Chandler, Mr. D  how’s it going  sir?
Chandler, And?
Chandler, So what does this mean?
Chandler, Hey  listen  I know I came in late last week  but I slept funny  and my hair was very very &ndash;
Chandler, Nina? Nina.  Nina.  Nina.
Chandler,  Yes  yes I am. Err  listen  the reason that I called you in here today was  err... please don’t hate me.
Chandler,  Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Rachel, So Pheebs  what do you want for your birthday?
Phoebe, Well  what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Rachel, Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Phoebe, Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Rachel, Ooh  okay... good.
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe,  Right  and it’s me.
Phoebe, Much as you are.
Phoebe,  Oh  that’s good.
Phoebe, Good choice.
Monica, I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?
Chandler, Well  you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
Monica, Congratulations  I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.
Chandler, I’m just trying to find the right moment  you know?
Rachel," Oh  well  that shouldn’t be so hard  now that you’re dating.  ""Sweetheart  you’re fired  but how ’bout a quickie before I go to work?"""
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, You know  once you’re inside  you don’t have to knock any more.
Monica, I’ll get it.
Monica, Oh. Hi  Mr.Heckles.
Monica, We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking  quietly.
Rachel, You don’t even have cats.
Monica,  Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Rachel, We’ll try to keep it down.
Joey, Phoebe  could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Phoebe, Ooh  my first birthday present...  ..oh  this is really...
Joey, Oh  no no no. It’s for Ursula. I just figured  you know  size-wise.
Phoebe, Ohhh... Sure  yeah...  ..okay  it fits.
Rachel, Are you seein’ her again tonight?
Joey, Yep. Ice Capades.
Chandler, Wow  this is serious. I’ve never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Joey, I don’t know. I like her  you know. She’s different. There’s uh  somethin’ about her.
Phoebe, That you like   we get it. You like her. Great!
Joey, Hey  Phoebe  I asked you  and you said it was okay.
Phoebe, Alright  well  maybe now it’s not okay.
Joey, Okay... Well maybe now I’m not okay with it not being okay.
Phoebe, Okay.
Chandler, Knit  good woman  knit  knit!
Chandler, And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.
Chandler, Yes  yes she is. Didn’t I memo you on this? See  after I let her go  err  I got a call from her psychiatrist  Dr. Flanen-nen  Dr. Flanen  Dr. Flan.
Chandler, And err  he informed me that uh  she took the news rather badly  in fact  he uh  mentioned the word frenzy.
Chandler, Oh  no  no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact  if you asked her right now  she would have no recollection of being fired at all  none at all.
Chandler, And yet  believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself  or others.
Chandler, Well  I guess that’s why they call it psychology  sir.
Ross, Susan  go deep.
Ross, Carol  honey  shhh  shhh  everything’s gonna be alright.
Ross, I’m gonna be a father.
Rachel, This is just occurring to you?
Ross, I always knew I was havin’ a baby  I just never realised the baby was having me.
Rachel,  Oh  you’re gonna be great!
Ross, Aw  how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Chandler, You know  Ross  some scientists are now saying that  that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Phoebe, Where’re you going?
Joey, Out.
Phoebe, With?
Joey,  Yes.
Phoebe, Alright  could I just ask you one question?
Phoebe, Have you two  you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
Joey, Well  not that it’s any of your business  but  no  we haven’t  okay?
Joey, You meant sex  right?
Chandler, Ah  sure  Nina. What’s up?
Chandler, Oh  well  ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous  of us.
Chandler, Ah  well  maybe that’s  ah  because you’re getting a big raise.
Chandler, Sure  why not?
Chandler, Oh  you don’t know.  Helen  could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
Chandler, Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?
Chandler, Well  I ended up telling her everything.
Rachel, Oh  how’d she take it?
Chandler, Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.  Little tip: if you’re ever in a similar situation  never ever leave your hand...  ..on the desk.
Monica, Okay  I think I get how to do this.
Phoebe, Alright  so  can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can’t  I can’t watch.
Monica,  okay  Pheebs  they’re gone.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Are you alright?
Phoebe, Yeah. It’s just  you know  it’s this whole stupid Ursula thing  it’s...
Rachel, Okay  Pheebs  can I ask? So  he’s going out with her. I mean  is it really so terrible?
Phoebe, Um  yeah. Look  I mean  I’m not saying she’s like evil or anything. She just  you know  she’s always breaking my stuff. When I was eight  and I wouldn’t let her have my Judy Jetson thermos  so she threw it under the bus. And then  oh  and then there was Randy Brown  who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
Phoebe, Well  but that’s what he was for me. And she you know  kind of stole him away  and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn’t even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn’t wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
Rachel, Oh... Oh  Pheebs.
Phoebe, I mean  I know Joey is not my boyfriend  or my thermos  or anything  but...
Chandler, You’re not gonna lose him.
Monica, Hon  you gotta talk to Joey.
Phoebe, Yeah. Okay.
Ross, No  come on  he doesn’t know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
Phoebe, But he’s falling in love with her.
Rachel, Oh please  they’ve been going out a week. They haven’t even slept together yet  I mean  that’s not serious.
Phoebe, Okay... Okay.
Phoebe, Oh  okay  oh.
Monica, Rachel  what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Rachel, No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down  so...  ..I’m takin’ ’em down. Okay? Whoa! 
Monica, Oh-my-god Rachel!  Rachel!
Rachel,  I’m okay! I’m okay!  Mr. Heckles  Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Monica, Hi. Uh  my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights  and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Rachel, Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
Monica, Okay  ooh  alright. Name  address... Okay  in case of emergency  call?
Rachel, You.
Monica, Really?
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Oh  that is so sweet.  Oh gosh  love you. Insurance?
Rachel, Oh  yeah  check it. Definitely  I want some of that.
Monica,  you don't have insurance?
Rachel, Why  how much is this gonna cost?
Monica, I have no idea  but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Rachel, Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
Monica, Well there's not much we can do.
Rachel,  Um... unless  unless I use yours.
Monica, Hah  no no no no no no no no no no.
Rachel,"  well  now  wait a second  who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" person?"
Monica,  That's insurance fraud.
Rachel, Well  alright  then  forget it.  Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Monica,  Okay  okay. I hate this.
Rachel, Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Monica,  Hi   um  I'm gonna need a new set of  these forms .
Monica,  I am really an idiot.  you see  I was filling out my friend's form  and instead of putting her information   I put mine.
Monica,  yep  that's me   I am that stupid .
Ross, I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Ross, No  no  with him.  I'm on this field  and they  they hike me the baby... and I  I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Joey, Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Ross, Right  but  it is just me and the baby  so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh  hah-hah  I just heave it down field.
Chandler, What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey, He should take the sack?
Ross, Anyway  suddenly I'm down field  and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him  right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time  so I am running  and running  and that  that is when I woke up. See I  I am so not ready to be a father.
Chandler, Hey  you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring  most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Joey, Yeah  Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Joey, Oh  have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Chandler, Well  only if you order stuff.
Joey, I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross, Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Joey, When's that?
Ross, Tonight.
Joey, Oh  man. What're the odds of that happening?
Ross, You take your time.
Chandler, There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Joey, What can I do? Look  I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Chandler, And your friend Phoebe?
Joey, Well  if she's my friend  hopefully she'll understand. I mean  wouldn't you guys?
Chandler, Man  if you tried something like that on my birthday  you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Monica, Yes?  ..yes  she is.
Rachel, Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Rachel, I meant er   young  young  I meant young  young to be a doctor. Oh good  Rach.
Rachel, ..so  he said it was just a sprain  and that was it.
Monica, Uh  you left out the stupid part.
Rachel," Not stupid. The very cute  cute  cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night  and I said ""yes."""
Monica, I think it's totally insane  I mean  they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know  I say we blow off the dates.
Rachel, What? Monica  they are cute  they are doctors   cute doctors  doctors who are cute!
Chandler, Alright  what have we learned so far?
Ross, What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Rachel, Was that the cake?
Ross, Yeah  yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
Monica, Come on  she'll be here any minute.
Rachel, I hope it's okay.
Monica, Oh...
Chandler,"  ""Happy Birthday Peehe."""
Monica, Well maybe we can make a  a  a 'B' out of one of those roses.
Ross,  Yeah  we'll just use our special cake tools.
Phoebe, Hey  what's going on?
Ross, Oh  we just...
Phoebe,  oh  oh  oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty  Hi!  You found Betty! Oh my god!  This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room   Where's Joey?
Chandler, Did you see Betty?
Ross, Dad  before I was born  did you freak out at all?
Ross," Dad  dad  dad  I'm talkin' about the whole uh  baby thing. Did you uh  ever get this sort of... panicky  ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
Ross, No  no  Dad  I was just wondering.
Ross, Thanks  Dad  really  I ju... you know  I just  I just needed to know  um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Ross, No  we can go to Williamsburg.
Monica, Rachel  the cute doctors are here.
Rachel,  Okay  coming!
Monica, Hi  come on in.
Monica, Hi  Geoffrey.
Rachel, Hi.
Rachel, Oh  that's great. Look at that.
Monica, It's uh...
Rachel, Okay  listen  I'm thinking  why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean  it'll be fine  I really think it'll be fine.
Monica, It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Rachel, Oh  Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica, A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world  okay?
Monica, I said we are not going to do it  okay? Sometimes you can be such a  a big baby.
Rachel,  I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god  just because you get so uptight every time we...
Monica, Sure  every time  you're such a princess...
Rachel, You know what?
Monica, What?
Rachel, You know what?
Monica, What!?
Rachel, You know what?
Monica,  What!!?
Rachel, Every day  you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Rachel, Hello! Here we go!
Rachel,  Thanks! I've been here about six years  and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Monica,  Yeah...  ..see  I was supposed to get married  but  um  I left the guy at the altar.
Monica,  Yeah... Yeah  I know it's pretty selfish  but haha  hey  that's me.  Why don't you try the hummus?
Rachel,  Aahh  I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Rachel,  Yeah it is  mostly because I get to boss people around  which I just love to do.
Monica,   Oh  god  I am so spoiled... That's it!
Rachel,  And by the way  have I mentioned that back in high school  I was a cow?
Monica,  I used to wet my bed.
Rachel,  I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Monica,   We both do that!
Monica,  Hi  Dad. No  no  it's me.  li-listen  Dad  I can't talk right now  um  but there's something  um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Rachel, Would you excuse me for a second?
Monica,  Remember back in freshman year?  Well  Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Rachel,  Daddy... Daddy... Daddy  why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business!  ...dead!
Monica, Ross  he's got the remote again.
Ross, Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross, Maybe not.
Rachel, Hello?  Um  yeah  uh   Okay ah  hold on a second  lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Rachel, It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh  god  oh god...
Monica, I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Rachel, Okay  no  you do it.
Monica,  Hello  this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh...  Okay  yes  we'll be right  we'll be right down. Thank you. 
Rachel, What?
Monica, We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Rachel, Ohhh...  Okay  you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Monica, Thank you.
Rachel, Okay  let me just change.
Monica, Yes.
Joey,  Hey.
Monica, Hi.
Phoebe, Trouble?
Joey, Your sister stood me up the other night.
Phoebe, Oh  no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Ross, Well did you try calling her?

Rachel,  Yeah  and and  I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Rachel,  Yeah  I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
Chandler, Okay  worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Ross, Uh-huh.
Chandler, Say your son never feels connected to you  as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Ross, Do you have a point?
Chandler, You know  you think I would.
Chandler, What's up with the simian?
Ross, It's just a fur ball.
Chandler, Okay...  ..whose turn is it?

Rachel,  Give me that!
Chandler, You know  I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
Ross, I don't know.
Chandler, Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
Ross, No  it's not just that. It's just—I want someone who... who does something for me  y'know? Who gets my heart pounding  who... who makes me  uh... 
Chandler, ...little playthings with yarn?
Ross, What?
Chandler, Could you want her more?
Ross, Who?
Chandler,  Dee  the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Ross, Look  I am totally  totally over her  OK  I just... : Hiiii!
Rachel, Hi! How are you?
Ross, We're fine  we're fine.
Rachel, OK. 
Joey, Shut up!
Chandler, We're not—we're not saying anything.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Joey, Thank you.
Chandler,  We were playing poker  alright...
Joey, There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight  alright?
Ross, Oh  guys  you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Chandler, And then he did.
Rachel, Well  now  how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Phoebe, Yeah  what is that? Like  some kind of guy thing? Like  some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker  so only guys can play?
Ross, No  women are welcome to play.
Phoebe, Oh  OK  so then what is it? Some kind of... you know  like  like... some kind of  y'know  like... alright  what is it?
Chandler, There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey, Yeah  we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Monica, Oh  please  that is such a lame excuse!
Rachel, Really.
Monica, I mean  that's a typical guy response.
Ross, Excuse me  do any of you know how to play?
Rachel, But you could teach us.
Chandler,  OK  so now we draw cards.
Monica, So I wouldn't need any  right? Cause I have a straight.
Rachel, Oh  good for you!
Phoebe, Congratulations!
Chandler, OK Phoebs  how many do you want?
Phoebe, OK  I just need two... the  um  ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Ross, No. No  uh  Phoebs? You can't—you can't do...
Rachel, Oh wait  I have the ten of spades! Here! 
Ross, No  no. Uh... no  see  uh  you-you can't do that.
Rachel, Oh  no-no-no-no-no-no  that's OK  I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Ross, Oh  you're... 
Monica, Alright  here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Joey, Whoa  whoa  whoa  Monica  what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips  or dip  or pretz...
Chandler,  OK  so at this point  the dealer...
Monica, Alright  you know  we got it  we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Ross, Alright  now  you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Phoebe, But... I'm ready  so  just deal.
Chandler, OK  alright  last minute lesson  last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe  deal the cards.
Monica,  Dammit  dammit  dammit!
Phoebe, : Oh I see  so then  you were lying.
Joey, About what?
Phoebe, About how good your cards were.
Joey, Heh... I was bluffing.
Phoebe, A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Rachel, OK  sorry to break up this party  but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... 
Chandler, Rach  Rach  we gotta settle.
Rachel, Settle what?
Chandler, The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see  King George is giving us the land  so...
Ross, The game  Rachel  the game. You owe us money for the game.
Rachel, Oh. Right.
Joey, You know what  you guys? It's their first time  why don't we just forget about the money  alright?
Monica, Hell no  we'll pay!
Phoebe, OK  Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Monica, And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross, Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Rachel, : So basically  you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Ross, ...Yeah.
Chandler, Yes  and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself  but they cost a little less.
Ross, Look  Rachel  this is poker. I play to win  alright? In order for me to win  other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me  don't expect me to be a 'nice guy ' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... 
Joey, ...Yeah?
Ross, I'm not a nice guy.
Ross, Alright boys  let's eat.
Chandler, Oh  did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
Ross, You still on that?
Chandler," Oh  come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : ""When I play poker  I'm not a nice guy!"""
Ross, You are way off  pal.
Joey, No  I don't think so  see Ross  because I think you love her.
Ross, Um.... no. See  I might've had feelings for her at one time—not any more. I just—I...
Ross, Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
Ross, You are not putting that on again! Marcel  OK—if you press that button  you are in very  very big trouble.
Rachel,  Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Monica, Yeah  I know. He can get really competitive.
Phoebe, Ha. Ha  ha.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Oh  hello  kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Monica, Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Rachel, Oh  I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?
Monica, That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing  a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Rachel, Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
Monica, You're kidding! Where? Where?
Rachel, : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
Monica, Oh  Rachel!
Phoebe, Oh  it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Monica, Well  what's the job?
Rachel, Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
Monica, OK  look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says.  Hi!
Rachel, No.
Monica, I don't think so.
Rachel, Why?
Monica, What?
Rachel, Oh my God!
Monica, Really?
Phoebe, Thank y... 
Monica, Uh  Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe  and that's Rachel...
Phoebe, Ross  could we please  please  please listen to anything else?
Ross, Alright.
Ross, I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Guys! Guess what  guess what  guess what  guess what!
Chandler, Um  ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Rachel, Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours  we have the same taste in clothes  and—oh  I went to camp with her cousin... And  oh  the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!
Rachel, Oh God  oh  and then she told the funniest story...
Monica, OK  great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Joey, Alright now listen  you guys  we talked about it  and if you don't want to play  we completely understand.
Chandler, Oh yes  yes  we could play some other game... like  uh  I don't know... Pictionary?
Monica, Ha  ha  very funny  very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we  ladies?
Ross, Uh  Rach  do you want me to shuffle those?
Rachel, No  no  thats OK. Y'know  I think I'm gonna give it a go.
Ross, Alright.
Rachel, Alright... 
Ross, So  Phoebs owes $7.50  Monica  you owe $10  and Rachel  you owe fifteen big ones.
Joey, But hey  thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys  we gotta play that at our regular game.
Phoebe, Alright  here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Joey, What?
Phoebe, Oh  I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Chandler, That's alright  I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
Ross, Well  that just leaves the big Green poker machine  who owes fifteen...
Rachel, Mmm-hmmm. Oh  so typical. Ooo  I'm a man. Ooo  I have a penis. Ooo  I have to win money to exert my power over women. 
Monica, You know what? This is not over. We will play you again  and we will win  and you will lose  and you will beg  and we will laugh  and we will take every last dime you have  and you will hate yourselves forever.
Rachel, Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there  Mon.
Ross, So  you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way  we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Rachel, Ooooh  that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there  monkey boy.
Monica, OK  we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Phoebe,  Hey you guys  look  the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.  Right  OK  serious poker.
Monica, Excuse me  where are you going?
Ross, Uh... to the bathroom.
Monica, Do you want to go to the bathroom  or do you wanna play poker?
Ross, I want to go to the bathroom. 
Joey, Alright  well  I'm gonna order a pizza. 
Rachel, Oh no-no-no-no-no  I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine  so you can eat then.
Joey, That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Monica, Alright  Cincinnati  no blinds  everybody ante. 
Phoebe,  Yes!  .... or no.
Ross, Alright. : Your money's mine  Green.
Rachel, Your fly is open  Geller. 
Phoebe, You guys  you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler, Hey  that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Joey, Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah. Um... I'm out. 
Rachel, I'm in.
Monica, Me too.
Joey, Me too. Alright  whattaya got.
Ross, Well  you better hop outta the shower  cause... I gotta flush. 
Rachel, Well  well  well  hop back in bucko  cause I got four sixes!  I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what?  I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.  I think that one was Ross's  and I think—oh—that one was Ross's. Yes! : Well  I have got your money  and you'll never see it...
Rachel, And your fly's still open...
Rachel, Ha  I made you look....
Rachel, I couldn't be inner. Monica?
Phoebe, Monica  in or out?
Monica,  I hate this game!
Phoebe, OK Joey  your bet.
Joey, Ahhh  I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.  Oh  I'm out.
Phoebe, Ross?
Ross, Oh  I am very in.
Phoebe, Chandler?
Chandler, Couldn't be more out. 
Phoebe, Me too. Rachel.
Rachel, Uh  I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck?
Ross, No  not this time.  So... what'd you have?
Rachel, I'm not telling. 
Ross, Come on  show them to me. 
Rachel, No..!
Ross, Show them to me!
Rachel, Get your hands out of there! No!
Ross, Let me see! Show them!
Chandler, Y'know  I've had dates like this.
Rachel,  Boy  you really can't stand to lose  can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple...
Phoebe, Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
Ross, First of all  I'm not losing...
Rachel, Oh  you are losing. Definitely losing. 
Ross, Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...
Rachel,  Hel-lo  Rachel Green.
Ross,  Mee mee  mee-mee mee.
Rachel,  Excuse me.  It's about the job.
Rachel, Barbara! Hi  how are you?  Uh-huh.  No  I understand. Yeah. Oh  oh  come on  no  I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh  but you know  if-if anything else opens up  plea—Hello? Hello? 
Monica, Sorry  Rach.
Phoebe, Y'know  there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Rachel, Yeah.......OK. Where were we? Oh  OK... five card draw  uh... jacks or better... nothing wild  everybody ante.
Joey, Look  Rachel  we don't have to do this.
Rachel, Yes  we do. 
Monica, Alright  check.
Joey, Check.
Ross, I'm in for fifty cents. 
Chandler, Call.
Phoebe, I'm in.
Rachel, I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. 
Ross, I thought  uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Rachel, Well  I just lost a job  and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Rachel, : Loser?
Ross, No  I fold. 
Rachel, What do you mean  you fold? Hey  come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt  I'm not a nice guy.' I mean  what  were you just full of it?
Ross, I'm in. 
Rachel, How many you want?
Ross, One. 
Rachel, Dealer takes two.  What do you bet?
Ross, I bet two dollars. 
Rachel, OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. 
Ross, I see your twenty  raise you twenty-five. 
Rachel, See your twenty-five...and...uh  Monica  get my purse.
Monica, Rachel  there's nothing in it.
Rachel, OK  then get me your purse.
Monica, OK  here you go. Good luck.
Rachel, : Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five  and I raise you... seven.
Phoebe, ...teen! 
Ross, : Joey  I'm a little shy.
Joey, That's OK  Ross  you can ask me. What?
Chandler, : What do you need  what do you need?
Ross, Fifteen.
Chandler, Alright  here's ten. 
Joey, Here  I got five  I got five. 
Ross, Thank you.
Chandler, Good luck.
Ross, : OK  I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?
Rachel,  Full house.
Ross, You got me.
Joey, : Ahhh  that's alright. Y'know  that's a tough hand to beat.
Chandler, : I thought we had them!
Ross, Oh  well  when you don't have the cards  you don't have the cards  you know.  But  uh... look how happy she is. 
Chandler, Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Rachel, Oh  time's up.
Monica,  Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Joey, Oh!
Phoebe, That's a bird?
Phoebe, That's a bird!
Rachel, OK  OK  it's my turn. 
Chandler, Go.
Ross, Uh.... bean! Bean!
Joey,  The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Rachel, Yes!
Monica, That  you get? That  you get?
Rachel, Okay  okay  I checked. We have: Earl Grey  English Breakfast  Cinnamon Stick  Camomile  Mint Medley  Blackberry  and.. oh  wait  there's one more  um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea  are you?  Okay.
Monica, Mail call  Rachel Green  bunk seven.
Rachel, Thank you.  Oh  cool! Free sample of coffee!
Monica, Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Rachel, Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Monica, What is it?
Rachel, Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God  it's Barry and Mindy!
Monica, Barry who you almost...?
Rachel, Barry who I almost.
Monica, And Mindy  your maid of...?
Rachel, Mindy  my maid of. Oh!
Monica,  That's Mindy? Wow  she is pretty.  Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
Ross, Marcel. Bring me the rice  c'mon. Bring me the rice  c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere  gimme the rice.  Thank you  good boy. Well  I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'.  'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Rachel, What?
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Oh  I'm sorry. Oh  this is so stupid! I mean  I gave Barry up  right? I should be happy for them! I am  I'm happy for them.
Ross, Really.
Rachel, No. Oh  oh  I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Ross, Whoah  uh  what happened to  uh  'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole  uh  penis embargo?
Rachel, Oh  I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys  it's about the right guy  y'know? I mean  with Barry  it was safe and it was easy  but there was no heat. With Paolo  that's all there was  was heat! And it was just this raw  animal  sexual...
Ross, Wait-wait. I  I got it. I was there.
Rachel, Well  I mean  do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like  who's like your best friend  but then also can make your toes curl?
Ross, Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes  I really do! In fact  it's funny  very often  someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes  might just be the one who...
Monica, Hi.
Ross, ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Rachel, Hi  how was the movie?
Monica, Wonderful!
Phoebe, So good!
Joey, Suck-fest.
Chandler, Toootal chick-flick.
Phoebe, I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with  like  y'know  guns and bombs and  like  buses going really fast...
Joey, Hey  I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Monica, There was nudity!
Joey, I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
Ross, Alright  I've gotta go. C'mon  Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are  aren't we? Yes  we are.
Chandler, They're still just friends  right?
Rachel,  And I will see you tomorrow!
Ross, That's right  you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's  aren't you.
Monica, Oh  hang on  hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Ross, 'Pwease  Aunt Monica  pwease?' Oh  unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
Chandler, I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Joey, I agree. I'm  like  in disbelief.
Chandler, I mean  don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel  they would've happened already?
Ross, I'm telling you  she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Joey, She really said that?
Ross, Well  I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone  and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Joey, 'Tonight' tonight?
Ross, Well  I think it's perfect. Y'know  it's just gonna be the two of us  she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Chandler, I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross, Anyway  I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine  go over there and  uh  try to woo her.
Chandler, Hey  y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's  when that phrase was last used.
Rachel, Now  now the one in the feather boa  that's Dr. Francis. Now  she used to be a man. Okay  now look  see  there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay-  Wh- wh- Marcel  are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel  did you poo in the shoe?  Marcel  bad monkey! Oh! Oh!  Sorry  Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that.  Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh  c'mon  roll him over! Oh...! Well  we know it wasn't Dexter  right Marcel? Because-  Marcel? Marc- 
Joey, How could you lose him?
Rachel, I don't know. We were watching TV  and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Monica, Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Rachel, I don't know. The left one.
Monica, Which ones?
Rachel, Oh. Oh  those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
Phoebe,  Hey.
Phoebe, Whoah  ooh  why is the air in here so negative?
Chandler, Rachel lost Marcel.
Phoebe, Oh no  how?
Monica, He- he pooped in my shoe.
Phoebe, Which one?
Monica, Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Phoebe, No  which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Rachel, C'mon  you guys  what're we gonna do  what're we gonna do?
Joey, Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Chandler, Okay  it's his first time out  so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats  you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Rachel, Oh  my  God  c'mon  you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Monica, Okay  we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor  Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Rachel, Well  what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Monica, Okay  you stay here  and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe  and wait for Ross to kill you.
Rachel, Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Monica, Mr. Heckles  our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
Monica, No!
Phoebe, Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
Monica, A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Phoebe, Okay  thank you  Mr. Heckles. 
Rachel,  Okay  he's a  he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with  with Russian dressing and  and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
Ross, Hey. How did  uh  how'd it go today?
Rachel, Great! It went great. Really great. Hey  is that wine?
Ross, Yeah. You  uh  you want some?
Rachel, Oh  I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
Ross, Uh  okay  yeah  we could do that  but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East  I was  uh  kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were  uh  y'know  talking before about  uh  relationships and stuff?  Well-
Rachel, Oh God  Ross  I cannot do this.
Ross, Okay  quick and painful. 
Rachel, Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross  please don't hate me.
Ross, Oh  what? What-what?
Rachel, Y'know Marcel?
Ross, ...Yeah?
Rachel, Well  I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Ross,  I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean  all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Rachel, I know  I know  I'm sorry-
Ross, No  y'know what  I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know  I shouldn't've  uh  asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Rachel,  Ross  I'm doing everything that I can  I've got everybody looking for him  and I-  Oh! Who is it?
Rachel, See? I've even called Animal Control!
Ross, You called Animal Control?
Rachel, Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Ross, Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him  they'll take him away from me.
Rachel, O-okay  now see  you never ever ever told us that...
Ross, That's right  I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
Rachel, Hi  thanks for coming.
Rachel, Oh  y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! 
Ross, Yeah  we thought we had a monkey  but we-we didn't.
Rachel, Turned out it was a hat.
Ross, Cat!
Rachel, Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Monica, Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor  no-one's seen Marcel.
Ross, My uncle Marcel.
Phoebe, Oh  is that who the monkey's named after?
Phoebe, Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Monica, Pheebs  you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Phoebe, Yes  but there isn't always time!
Monica, Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um  have a seat. First of all  we haven't been introduced  I'm Monica Geller.
Rachel, Yeah!
Rachel, Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
Monica, The Luisa from home room!
Rachel, Yes!!
Monica, No  none at all.
Rachel, None.
Monica, Oh  I'm- I'm so sorry!
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Be that as it may  d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know  just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
Phoebe, Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Chandler, Marcel?
Joey, Marcel?
Chandler, Marcel?
Joey, Marcel?
Chandler, Um  we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
Joey, A monkey.
Chandler, Yes have you seen any?
Joey, Um  sure! Did you  uh  did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Joey, Oh. Then  no.
Chandler, Oh  nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se  but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Joey, Uh  aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Chandler, Yes  but these women are very hot  and they need our help! And they're very hot.
Joey, We can't  alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry  but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him  he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel  so if we could get some pictures of you  you'd really be helping us out.
Chandler, Okay  from now on  you don't get to talk to other people.
Joey, Marcel?
Chandler, Marcel?!
Phoebe, Marcel?
Monica, Marcel?
Phoebe, Marcel?
Phoebe, Oh-my-God!
Monica, Whaaat!
Phoebe, Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Monica, What is it?
Phoebe, Oh  it's okay  it was just my left leg.
Monica, Look  Phoebe!
Phoebe, Yeah! Oh  c'mere  Marcel! Oh  Marcel  c'mere!
Monica, What're you gonna do?
Monica, Run  Marcel  run! Run  Marcel!  Are you okay?
Phoebe, Yeah  think so. Oh!  Huh.  Whoah.
Monica, Oh gosh.
Ross, Marcel?
Rachel, Marcel?
Ross, Marc- oh  this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone  he's-he's just gone.
Rachel, Ross  you don't know that.
Ross, Oh come on. It's cold  it's dark  he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey  and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Rachel, Ross  I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay  I'm gonna break my foot  right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God  oh my God! There  are you happy now?!
Ross, Yeah  yeah. Y'know  now that you kicked the sign  hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Rachel, Y'know  it is not like I did this on purpose.
Ross, Oh  no no no. Nono  this is just vintage Rachel. I mean  things just sort of happen around you. I mean  you're off in Rachel-land  doing your Rachel-thing  totally oblivious to people's monkeys  or to people's feelings...
Rachel, Ross.
Ross, I don't even wanna hear it  you're just...
Rachel, Ross.
Ross, Oh  forget it  okay?
Rachel, Ross!
Ross, What? What?
Phoebe, Oh  this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep  and the other side has no idea.
Ross, Hi  did you order some bananas?
Ross, Gimme back my monkey.
Rachel, Then what's with all the bananas?
Ross, Marcel? Marcel? Okay  where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
Ross, Marcel! What've you done to him?
Ross, Are you insane? C'mere  Marcel  c'mon. 
Ross, C'mere  Marcel. 
Ross, Okay  gimme my monkey back.
Ross, Alright  I want my monkey.
Rachel, Oh  c'mon  Luisa!
Ross,  You had to be a bitch in high school  you couldn't've been fat.
Rachel, Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey  I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want  but please do not punish him. C'mon  Luisa  you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
Rachel, Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor  and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
Ross, It'll be nice to get this off finally  won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now  that's fine.
Rachel, Y'know  with the right pair of pumps  that would be a great little outfit.
Ross, Listen  I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before  it's just I...
Rachel, Oh  Ross  c'mon. It's my fault  I almost lost your...
Ross, Yeah  but you were the one who got him back  y'know? You  you were great. ...Hey  we uh  we still have that  uh  that bottle of wine. You in the mood for  uh  something grape?
Rachel, That'd be good.
Ross, Alright.  The  uh  the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well  so long as we're here and  uh  not on the subject  I was thinking about  uh  how mad we got at each other before  and  um  I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we  um...
Rachel, Barry?!
Ross, We have got to start locking that door!
Monica, This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe, Nope.
Monica, That's because I'm in front of them.
Chandler, Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica, Well  high school was not my favourite time.
Joey, I dunno  I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Chandler, Yeah  well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Monica, Gosh  doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Phoebe, Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Chandler, I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Joey, No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor  all right  he's got to be  like  thetoughest snack there is.
Ross, I don't know  you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Monica,  Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross, I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel, Oh  that is so sick.
Chandler, I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Phoebe, How can people do that?...  Oh  you guys  look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
Chandler, I am telling you  years from now  schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves  we didn't have to play any games...
Monica, So have you called her yet?
Chandler, Let her know I like her? What are you  insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right  right?
Monica, I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Phoebe, Oh  God  just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Chandler, Which  by the way  is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.
Joey, Her answer machine?
Chandler, No  interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
Phoebe, So  uh  why didn't you say anything?
Chandler," Oh  no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
Monica, Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No  don't everybody look at once!
Ross, Okay  okay  what's going on?
Phoebe, Okay  they're just talking...
Ross, Yeah  well  does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Phoebe, No  no actually  he's smiling.. and... Oh my God  don't do that!!
Ross, What? What? What?!
Phoebe, That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
Chandler,  And basically  that's how a bill becomes a law.
Chandler, Hey Rach!
Monica, How'd it go?
Rachel, Y'know  it was  uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room  and I had that chicken  where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Phoebe, Not a good day for birds...
Rachel, Then we took a walk down to Bendall's  and I told him not to  but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Ross, That's nice... now  was that before or after you told him to stop calling  stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone  hmm?
Rachel, Right .. well .. we never actually got to that... Oh  it was just so nice to see him again  y'know? It was comfortable  it was familiar... it was just nice!
Ross, That's  that's nice twice!
Monica, Rachel  what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Joey, Duh  where've you been?
Rachel, Yeah  but it was different with him today! And he wasn't  like  Orthodontist Guy  y'know? I mean  we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Chandler, Yes!
Rachel, Why?
Chandler, I have my reasons.
Monica, Okay  how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman  who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Rachel, All right. All right  all right  all right  all right  I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon  and I will just put an end to it!
Rachel, Wow... Wow!
Rachel, I'm not crazy  right? I mean  it was never like that.
Rachel, Ooh  and it's so nice having this little sink here...
Chandler,  Oh  Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
Monica, That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Chandler, Hey  I've been honing!
Ross, What was with the dishes?
Chandler, Oh  uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life  like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Monica,  Look look! He's doing it again  the guy with the telescope!
Phoebe, Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
Monica, Great  now he's waving back.
Joey, Man  we gotta do something about that guy. This morning  I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica, What kinda stuff?
Joey, Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff  but  like  when I'm cooking naked.
Phoebe, You cook naked?
Joey, Yeah  toast  oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Chandler, What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Rachel, Oh  it's just... Oh  Barry  this was not good.
Rachel, Well  what about Mindy?
Rachel, No  not that  I mean  what about you and Mindy?
Rachel, No. No-no-no-no  no. I mean  don't do that. Not  I mean not for me.
Rachel, Oh  Barry..! Come on  this is all way too..
Rachel, I had a bra.
Rachel, What?!
Chandler, Can I use your phone?
Monica, Yeah.. uh  but for future reference  that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Chandler, Yes  it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Joey, Maybe she never got your message.
Phoebe, Y'know  if you want  you can call her machine  and if she has a lot of beeps  that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Chandler, Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
Ross, ...desperate  needy  pathetic?
Chandler, Ah  you obviously saw my personal ad.
Phoebe, How many beeps?
Chandler, She answered.
Monica, Y'see  this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Chandler, I'm not gonna talk to her  she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God  I miss just being needy.
Phoebe, How'd he take it?
Rachel, Pretty well  actually... 
Monica,  Uh  Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Rachel, Oh  do I?
Monica, Uh huh.
Rachel,  We ended up having sex in his chair.
Monica, You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly  didn't I?
Ross, You-you had what?
Phoebe, Sex in his chair.
Ross, What  uh... what were you thinking?
Rachel, I don't know! I mean  we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
Ross, No! No no  it is nothing like me and Carol!
Rachel," Please. If she said to you  ""Ross  I want you on this couch  right here  right now "" what would you say?"
Chandler, If it helps  I could slide over.
Ross, It's  it's  it's  uh  a totally diferent situation! It's  it's apples and oranges  it's  it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Phoebe, Where are you going?
Ross,  I just have to go  all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life  I have a jam packed schedule  and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Chandler, Hello? Hello?
Rachel,  Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey  how are you?  Yes  yes  I've heard  congratulations  that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay  well I'm working tomorrow  but if you want you can  you can  you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right  so I'll  so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
Chandler, So how's Mindy?
Rachel, Oh  she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh  she sounded really weird  I gotta call Barry...  Hi  it's me  I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No  I figured that's where you'd be!
Monica, Brrrrrrr!
Chandler, Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey,  He's back! The peeper's back!
Joey,  Get down!
Rachel, Get down?
Chandler, ...And boogie!
Rachel, Thanks  but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Monica, Relax. Y'know  she may not even know.
Rachel, Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months  and now she calls me? I mean  what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend  you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Joey,  Yeah?
Rachel, And now  y'know  I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Joey, ..Naughty!
Rachel, Right  I'll see you guys later...
Joey, Oh  hold up  I'll walk out with you. Now  Rach  when she taught you to kiss  you were at camp  and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform  or-  That's fine  yeah...
Chandler, Okay  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Monica, Why don't you just take it with you?
Chandler, Hey  we haven't been on a second date  she needs to hear me pee?
Monica, Why don't you just call her?
Chandler, I can't call her  I left a message! I have some pride.
Monica, Do you?
Chandler, No!  Danielle  hi! It's  uh  it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh  listen  I don't know if you tried to call me  because  uh  idiot that I am  I accidentally shut off my phone.  Oh  uh  okay  that's fine  that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line  she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line  she's gonna call me back  she's on the other line  gonna call me back...
Monica, Don't you have to pee?
Chandler, 'S'why I'm dancing...
Rachel, Mindy.
Rachel, Hey  you.... So  what's up?
Rachel, Sure we should... So.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Of course!
Rachel, Was that all you wanted to ask me?
Rachel, Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?
Rachel, Oh sure it is!
Rachel, Um  what- what would make you think that?
Rachel,  Really. Mindy  if it'll make you feel any better  when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.
Rachel, What? What's what you were afraid of?
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Uh... Oh  Mindy  you are so stupid. Oh  we are both so stupid.
Rachel,  Smell familiar?
Rachel, Oh  I am so sorry.
Joey,  Oh my.
Ross," Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
Chandler, Ring dammit  ring!
Ross, Thanks.
Joey,  Hey  you know our phone's not working?
Chandler, What?!
Joey, I tried to call you from the coffee shop  and there was no answer.
Chandler,  I turned it off. Mother of God  I turned it off!
Monica, Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
Joey, Hey  so listen  I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Chandler, Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Joey,  Can I use your phone?  Yeah  the number for a Sidney Marks  please.
Ross," ""Heating device."""
Phoebe, Radiator.
Ross, Five letters.
Phoebe, Rdtor.
Joey,  Yeah  is Sidney there?  Oh  this is?  Sidney's a woman.
Monica, So she's a woman! So what?
Joey, Yeah. Yeah  so what?  Look  I live across the street   and I know all about you and your little telescope  and I don't appreciate it  okay?  Yeah  I can see you right now!  Hello!  If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear  I shouldn't have to feel like——Thank you  but... that's not really the point...  The point is that...  Mostly free weights  but occasionally..
Monica, Joey!!
Joey,  Yeah  my neighbor...  Yeah  the brunette...  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Monica, The green dress? Really?
Joey, Yeah  she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Monica,  Nooo!
Rachel, Hey. Got a second?
Rachel, Uh  we are here to break up with you.
Rachel, Uh- which one of us are you talking to there  Barr?
Rachel, Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Rachel, Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Rachel, Well  the first time didn't really count... I mean  y'know  's'Barry.
Rachel, Okay. Okay  we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey  if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you  this feels great.
Rachel, What are you talking about?! Mindy  the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Rachel, Oh God.
Rachel, And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
Monica, You okay?
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Really?
Rachel, Yeah! Y'know  ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding  I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Monica, Aww... 
Joey, Big day.
Joey, All right  I'll give you this  Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle  he's got the top hat...
Phoebe, You know he's gay?
Ross, I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Chandler, Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody  this is Danielle  Danielle  everybody.
Chandler, What are you doing here?
Chandler, ...I'm  I'm okay.
Chandler, That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me  whatever...
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, Whoo-hoo!
Monica, Yeah  there you go!
Ross, Second date!
Chandler, ...I dunno.
Rachel, You don't know?!
Chandler, Well  she seems very nice and everything  but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here  just to see if I was okay? I mean ... how needy is that?
Joey, How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica, I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel, Monica  would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica, I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross, I think when someone steals your credit card  they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler, Wow  what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica, That's me.
Phoebe, Oh! The yuk! Ross  he's doing it again! 
Ross, Marcel  stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel  come back-  come here  Marcel-
Rachel, Oh no  not in my room! I'll get him.
Monica, Ross  you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross, What? It's  it's just a phase.
Chandler, Well  that's what we said about Joey...
Ross, Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel,  Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross, What?
Rachel, Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Rachel, Oh  Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica, This woman's living my life.
Rachel, What?
Monica, She's living my life  and she's doing it better than me! Look at this  look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She  she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Rachel, You're not an artist.
Monica, Yeah  well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean  I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel, Oh  Monica  c'mon  you do cool things.
Monica, Oh really? Okay  let's compare  shall we.
Rachel,  Oh  it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Monica, Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Rachel,  Nooo...
Monica, This is so unfair! She's got everything I want  and she doesn't have my mother.
Chandler, How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey, No  still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Chandler, Joey... Switzerland?
Joey, Plus  y'know  I think it should be Joe. Y'know  Joey makes me sound like I'm  I dunno  this big.  Which I'm not.
Chandler, Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey, Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler, Well  it does not ring a bell with me...
Joey,  Joe Stalin. Y'know  that's pretty good.
Chandler, Might wanna try Joseph.
Joey, Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Chandler, Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie  starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Rachel, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey.
Monica, Hi.  Hi  uh  yes  this is Monica Geller. Um  I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Phoebe, What are you doing?
Monica,  Alright  great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class.
Rachel, What  what  so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Monica, This woman's got my life  I should get to see who she is.
Rachel, Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay  Monica  y'know what  honey  you're kinda losing it here! I mean  this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Phoebe, This is madness. It's madness  I tell you  for the love of God  Monica  don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Monica, What d'you think?
Phoebe, Lotsa things.
Rachel, Which one do you think she is?
Monica, Oh  no thanks  we're just here to observe.
Rachel, What does she mean?
Phoebe, I think she means  'You dance a dance class'. Oh  c'mon  c'mon. 
Monica, Okay  d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Rachel, She could be you.
Monica, Okay  I'm not getting this!
Phoebe,  I'm totally getting it!
Monica, Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Rachel, What? You just click when they click.
Phoebe, Okay. And  my  dead  mother  says  you  are  it. I'm with Rachel.
Monica, Great. It's gym class all over again.
Monica, Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Monica, Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Monica, Yeah. It's Dutch.
Monica, Um  Pennsylvania Dutch.
Ross,  Hi.
Joey, Where've you been?
Ross, At the vet.
Chandler, She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones  is she?
Ross, She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Joey,  Hey! He beat ya.
Ross, She says as time goes on  he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Chandler, So what does this mean?
Ross, I'm gonna have to give him up.
Joey, I can't believe it  Ross. This sucks!
Chandler, I don't get it  I mean  you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Ross, I know. I know. I mean  one day  he's this little thing  and before you know it  he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey, Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross, No  no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin ' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey, How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler, I know that one! ...No  that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross, Well  we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos  y'know  like  uh  San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream  because  y'know  he's out of state. Uh  my vet  uh  knows someone at Miami  so that's a possibility.
Chandler, Yeah  but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean  it's a total party zoo.
Phoebe, Hey. We found her  we found the girl.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Did you call the cops?
Rachel, Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler, Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross, What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Monica, Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes  you forget all that. I mean  she is this astounding person  with this  with this amazing spirit.
Ross, Yeah  which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler, ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe, Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Rachel, No way. No way did you do this.
Monica, It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Monica, ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel, Go Monana! Well  you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. 
Monica, 'Scuse me?
Monica, Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean  I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Monica, What?
Monica, Right. Till I bought a blow dryer  then I was shunned.
Monica, Uh-huh.
Monica, Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Ross,  Oh God.  We didn't get into Scranton.  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on  me or him.
Phoebe, I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross, Marcel! Marcel! Marcel  no! Good boy. See  how can nobody want him?
Rachel, Oh  somebody will.
Joey,  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler, You're kidding.
Joey, Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler, Y'know  you'd think I would've.
Joey, Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe, ...Flame Boy.
Ross, Where exactly is your zoo?
Ross, Yes.
Ross, No-no  he's  he's very docile.
Ross, Well I  I don't know. Why?
Ross, He can hold a banana  if that's whatcha mean...
Ross, Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Joey, We  we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler, ...He's in.
Ross, He's in! Oh  did you hear that  Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Monica, Yo- hooo!
Rachel, Where the hell've you been?
Monica, Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel, Are you drunk?!
Monica, Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel, Oh God  oh. Great  Monica  y'know what  you could've called  I have been up here  I've been worried...
Rachel, Monica? Monica!
Monica, Water rules!
Rachel, Yes  yes  it does. Okay  look  the restaurant called  they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica, Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel, Okay Monica  what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Monica, No  it is me! Y'know  I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know  when I'm with her  I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Rachel, Hello? Yes  she is  hold on a second  please. Monana  it's for you  the credit card people.
Monica, Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel, What?
Monica, They've arrested Monica.
Monica, Hi.
Monica, How are you?
Monica, Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Monica, I want you to know  it wasn't me who turned you in.
Monica, No  thank you! You have given me so much! I mean  if it wasn't for you  I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Monica, I just can't believe you're in here. I mean  what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica, Well  not... worried  just... wondering.
Monica, Not necessarily...
Monica, Um  I'm not actually Amish.
Monica, In. 
Monica, Yeah  but at least I'm doing it!
Phoebe, Okay. Good-bye  little monkey guy. Alright  I wrote you this poem. Okay  but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross, Aww. Thank you  Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe, Oh!
Chandler, Okay  bye  champ. Now  I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego  but remember  there's also a lot to learn.
Joey, I dunno what to say  Ross. Uh  it's a monkey.
Ross, Just  just say what you feel.
Joey, Marcel  I'm hungry.
Ross, That was good.
Rachel,  Marcel  this is for you. It's  uh  just  y'know  something to  um  do on the plane.
Ross, Uh  if you guys don't mind  I'd like to take a moment  just me and him.
Ross, Marcel  c'mere  c'mere.  Well buddy  this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you  and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me  you've been more like a be-  Okay  Marcel  please  could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel  would- okay  just take him away. Just take him.
Joey, Hi  uh  I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Joey, Holden McGroin.
Monica, Tell him.
Rachel, No.
Phoebe, Tell him  tell him.
Monica, Just...please tell him.
Rachel, Shut up!
Chandler, Tell me what?
Monica, Look at you  you won't even look at him.
Chandler,  Oh  come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Rachel, All right  all right  all right. Last night  I had a dream that  uh  you and I  were...
Phoebe, Doing it on this table. 
Chandler, Wow!
Joey, Exellent dream score.
Ross, Why  why  why would you dream that?
Chandler, More importantly  was I any good?
Rachel, Well  you were pretty damn good.
Chandler, Interesting  cause in my dreams  I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
Rachel, Well  last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross, I love it  when we share.
Chandler, You're okay there?
Ross, I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Chandler, I'm sorry  it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Chandler, Hello Rachel.
Rachel, Get off.
Phoebe,  Uh  uh  gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Joey, I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ross, Pheebs  why would you want to operate a drill press?
Phoebe, Just for some short-term-work. You know  until I get back some of my massage clients.
Chandler, Pirates again?
Phoebe," No  nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
Joey, Hey  hey  Chan. She could work for you.
Chandler,  Thanks Joey  that's a good idea.
Phoebe, What... I could  I could do it. What is it?
Chandler, Well  my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.
Phoebe, I could be a secretary.
Chandler, Well  you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing  because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Phoebe, I could do that.
Rachel, What are you playing with?
Ross, Oh  it's my new beeper.
Joey, What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Monica, Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help  come quick  they're still extinct.'
Ross, No  it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean  all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Chandler, A cool phone number  and a possible name for the kid.
Monica, All right  I'll see you guys later. 
Rachel, Off to see young Ethan?
Monica, Thank you.
Joey, How young is young Ethan? Young?
Monica, He's... our age.
Chandler, When we were?
Monica, Okay  he's a senior in college.
Ross, College?
Chandler, Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Monica, No  of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Monica, Oh  I can't pass for 22?
Phoebe, Well  maybe 25-26.
Monica, I am 26.
Phoebe, There you go.
Chandler, Can you hear that?
Phoebe,  Yeah?
Chandler, See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe, Oh. Uh  I'm on. 
Phoebe,  Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry  he's in a meeting right now.
Chandler, I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe, Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right  I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, Ross says hi.
Chandler, Ah!
Phoebe, This is so fun. All right  what do we do now?
Chandler, Well  now  I actually have to get to work.
Phoebe, Most likely.  Okay  I'm gonna be out there.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, All right. Bye bye.
Chandler, Bye bye.
Chandler,  Yes?
Phoebe, Whatcha doin'?
Chandler, Ooh. 
Monica, Windows are clean  candels are lit. Uh  belt's to tight  gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish?  No  cause I made lasagne.  Am I out of control?
Rachel, Just a touch. Mon  I don't understand. I mean  you've been dating this guy since like  what... his midterms? I mean  why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Monica, What?
Rachel, Could tonight be the Night?
Monica, I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen  and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Rachel, So  did you shave your legs?
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, A-ha!
Joey, Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Ross, Oh  oh. Oh  oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Joey, All right  relax  relax. Just relax  just relax. Be cool  be cool.
Ross,  Yeah  hi  I was just beeped.  No  Andr� is not here.  Third time today.  Yes  I'm sure... No  sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Joey, Services?  Oh  services.
Ross,  Yeah  you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah  that's right. That's right  JUMBO with a U  sir.  No  belive me  you don't want me. Judging by his number  I'd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie  bye bye.
Joey, Hey  hey. How was the first day?
Phoebe, Oh  exellent. Everyone was so  so nice.
Chandler, See  it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.
Phoebe, No  I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Chandler, Why not?
Phoebe, Oh  because  you know... they don't like you.
Chandler, What?!
Phoebe, I thought you knew that.
Chandler, Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Phoebe, Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Chandler, What are you talking about?
Phoebe," Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted  and  you know  now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know  Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing  ""Boss Man Bing""."
Chandler, I can't belive it.
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah. They even do you.
Chandler, They do me?
Phoebe, You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Chandler, I don't sound like that.
Ross, Oh  oh Chandler...
Joey, Oh... Yeah  you do.
Ross, 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Joey,  My scones.
Chandler, Okay  I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Chandler, That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh  shut up!
Monica, Did not.
Monica, How was that possible?
Monica, Okay.
Monica, Unless...
Monica, Uh  ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean  I'm going to  so...
Monica, Okay  is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Monica, Ethan?
Monica, Are you a virgin?
Monica, Really?
Monica, You keep saying that.
Monica, Listen  uh  you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I  I-I figured if you could be honest  then I can to.
Monica, No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Monica, Um  okay  here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm  I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Monica, But I figured  you know  that shouldn't change anything. I mean  what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Monica, You're not a senior?
Monica, Ok...ay.
Monica, What we did was wrong. Oh god  I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Monica, Ethan  focus. How could you not tell me?
Monica, Well  that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Monica, Don't say it. 
Monica, Really?
Monica, Well fall out of it. You know  you shouldn't even be here  it's a school night. Oh god  oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Ross,  Okay  Andr� should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie  bye bye.  Just easier that way.
Chandler, Oh  come on. You told me about the last dream.
Rachel, No  forget it.
Chandler, Oh  why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Rachel, All right  fine. Um  you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.
Joey, All right. 
Ross, Was there...uh  huh  huh  huh... andybody  anybody else there.
Rachel, No.
Ross, You're sure? Nobody uh  handed out uh  mints or anything?
Rachel, No  it was just the three of us.
Ross, Huh!
Joey, So  tell me. Was it like you and Chandler  and then you and me  or you and me and Chandler?
Rachel,  You know what?
Joey, What?
Rachel, There were times when it wasn't even me.
Phoebe, That is so sweet  you guys. 
Rachel, Mon  Ethan called again. Mon?
Monica, What?
Rachel, Ethan called again.
Monica, Oh.
Ross, Are you not seeing him anymore?
Monica, No. You know  sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Chandler, And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Rachel, I  I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything  I swear. He stopped by.
Joey, Listen  the next time you talk to him  can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Ross, Oh  yeah.
Monica, Ha ha  ha  oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Ross, It's morphin time!
Joey, Stegosaurus!
Chandler, Tyrannosaurus!
Phoebe, Ooh  oh  I've gotta go.  Whoa  oh  head rush. One more  and then I have to go.  Cool!
Rachel, Where are you going?
Phoebe, Um  oh  I've got a birthday party  with some work people.
Chandler, Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe, No  I know. That's a part of the whole  you know  them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Chandler, You know  I don't get this. A month ago  these people were my friends. You know  just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Phoebe, Well  then you should come tonight. You know  just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Chandler, You think I should?
Phoebe, I really do  yeah.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, Oh  but  could we not go together? I I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Chandler, I Think last night was great. You know  the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Phoebe, You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Chandler, What?
Phoebe," You know  now you're more like  you know like  ""Mr. Caring Boss "" ""Mr.""  you know  ""I'm one of you  Boss "" ""Mr.  I wanna be your buddy  Boss Man Bing!"""
Chandler, Then  I don't get it.
Phoebe, Well  you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like  the guy in the big office  you know. You're the one that hires them  that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Chandler, They do?
Phoebe, Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Chandler, I just wan't to...
Phoebe, No  but you can't.
Chandler, But I just wa...
Phoebe, Uh uh.
Monica, Aren't you gonna...
Ross, Oh  Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911  it means she's having a baby  otherwise I just ignore it.
Joey, What about Andr�?
Ross, Oh  well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan  and frankly  it was a little more than I needed to know.
Monica, That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel,  Hey  did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Ross, I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel, True story.
Joey, They're here already?
Monica, It was.
Monica, Ethan  it's um... it's icky.
Monica, This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different  I... If you were a few years older  or if I was a few years younger  or if we lived in biblical times  I would really...
Monica, ...love you.
Ross, Are you're hands still wet?
Joey, Uh  moist  yeah.
Rachel, Let's dry 'em again.
Chandler, Thanks. Listen  about the weekly numbers  I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
Chandler, You have to give 'em something  you know. Okay  now that was Gerston  Santos  and who's the guy with the moustache?

Ross, I don't know  but when I spoke to her  she said she had already passed the mucus plug.
Joey, Do we have to know about that?
Monica, Joey  what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Joey, I'm gonna be in the waitin' room  handing out cigars.
Chandler, Yes  Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
Ross, God  I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Rachel, Oh  Ross  relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction  and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
Rachel, What  it's ok when Chandler does it?
Chandler, You have to pick your moments.
Phoebe, Did I miss it  did I miss it?
Ross, She's not even here yet.
Monica, What's with the guitar?
Phoebe, I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know  things might get musical.
Ross,  Where the hell have you been?
Ross, Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby  ok  a baby  you don't stop for Chunkys.
Chandler, I used to have that bumper sticker.
Chandler,  You see what I mean.

Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, Oh  no  no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica, Ok  hypothetically  why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, No  no  no.
Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Chandler,  Uh  uh.
Monica, Well?
Chandler, Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
Rachel, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey. Ooh  look at you  dressy-dress.
Monica, Did you go home and change?
Rachel, Yeah  well  it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um  has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?
Monica, No  I haven't seen him.
Rachel, Well  where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him?
Chandler, Rachel  what is the deal with you and doctors  anyway? Was  like  your father a doctor?
Rachel, Yeah  why?
Chandler, No reason. 
Joey, Tribbiani.
Joey,  Hi  yeah  it's me.  Oh  no no no  we're just friends.  Yeah  I'm single.  25.  An actor.  Hello?
Joey, Yeah  so  uh  so  uh  what's the deal with this father guy  I mean  if someone was havin' my baby somewhere  I'd wanna know about it  you know?
Joey, Ok  look  maybe I should just go.
Joey, Good luck  and uh  take care  huh?
Joey, You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Joey, Oh  it is.
Joey, It is.
Ross, Breathe.
Ross, Breathe.
Ross, Breathe.
Ross, 15 more seconds  14  13  12...
Ross, Who the hell is Jordie?
Ross, No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed  my son's name is Jamie.
Ross, What? Whoa  whoa whoa whoa  what do you mean  back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy  Cody  Dylan fiasco.
Ross, I got it.
Ross, I got it! Hey  you get to sleep with her  I get the cramps.
Ross, Why?
Ross, No  you started it.
Ross, But...
Ross,  Thanks a lot.
Ross,  Yeah  listen...
Joey, Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Joey,  Water breaking  what do you mean? What's that  water breaking?
Ross, Please. This is so your fault.
Ross, Look  Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Ross, You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Ross, Oh  I'm threatened by you?
Phoebe, Hey  hey  ok  all right  that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god  you guys  I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling  just stop it!
Ross, Yeah  Susan.
Phoebe, Don't make me do this again  I don't like my voice like this.
Phoebe, Ok  who wants to hear something ironic?
Ross, I'm having a baby in here! Ok  everyone stand back.  Ow.
Rachel, No  honey  they're not  but don't worry  because we are going to find them  and until we do  we are all here for you  ok?
Rachel, Ok?
Rachel,  Ok  so anyway  you were telling me about Paris  it sounds fascinating.
Joey, Come on  Lydia  you can do it. Push! Push 'em out  push 'em out  harder  harder. Push 'em out  push 'em out  way out! Let's get that ball and really move  hey  hey  ho  ho. Let's—  I was just—yeah  right. Push! Push!
Ross, Help! Help!
Phoebe,  They found their bodies the very next day  they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la.
Monica, Now  Mom  everything's going fine  really.  Yeah  Ross is great. He's uh  he's in a whole other place.  No  he's gone.  No no  you don't have to fly back  really.  What do you mean this might be your only chance?  Would you stop? I'm only 26  I'm not even thinking about babies yet.
Chandler, Where have you been?
Joey, Oh  just had a baby.
Chandler, Mazel tov!
Rachel,  No  no  not at the moment  no  I'm not. Are you?
Rachel, Right  yeah  I've heard that about cute doctors.
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, I'm a waitress.
Rachel,  Yeah. Gotcha.
Rachel, Ok. That's fine. 
Ross, Come on  come on. Damnit  damnit  damnit  damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be  like  the greatest day of my life  y'know? My son is being born  and I should be in there  you know  instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Ross, No no no  believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have  ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over  you get to go home with the baby  ok? Where does that leave me?
Ross, Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Phoebe, This is so great.
Ross, You wanna explain that?
Phoebe, I mean  well  'cause when I was growing up  you know my dad left  and my mother died  and my stepfather went to jail  so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just  it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry  you were fighting.
Monica, I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Rachel, Yeah  honey  they wouldn't miss this.
Joey, Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Chandler,  You are really frightening me.
Chandler, Somebody wanna help me  tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh  that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?
Ross, Ok  got the vent open.
Phoebe,  Hi  I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ross, Ben  you ready? All right  gimme your foot. Ok  on three  Ben. One  two  three. Ok  That's it  Ben.
Phoebe, Well  Susan  I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes  it is in fact a dark vent.
Ross, Phoebs  It's open! It's open!
Ross, We're here!
Ross, Long story  honey.
Chandler,  Let me ask you  do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Ross, Let me see  I gotta see  I gotta see. Oh  a head. Oh  it's  it's huge. Carol  how are you doing this?
Ross,  Hello!  Oh  sorry.

Ross, The head  the head. You gotta...
Monica,  Hi  Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum.
Ross, Ben  I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around  like this.  But I'll still always come back  like this.  And sometimes I may be away longer  like this.  But I'll still always come back  like this. 
Chandler, And sometimes  I'll want you to steal third  and I'll go like this. 
Monica, He is so amazing.
Rachel, Oh  I know. Look at him.
Joey, Ben  Ben  hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Phoebe, Oh  look  look  he's closing his eyes.  Look  he's opening his eyes. 
Joey, He doesn't do much  does he?
Ross, No  this is pretty much it.
Rachel, You guys wanna get some coffee?
Ross, All right  I'll see you guys later.
Phoebe, Oh  look  he's closing his eyes again.
Ross, And here's little Ben nodding off...
Monica, Awww  look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Phoebe, Oh  look  he's got Ross's haircut!
Rachel, Oh  let me see!  Oh  God  is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Ross,  That would be nice.
Rachel, Pardon?

Monica, Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Joey, What  you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica, Man's got a point.
Joey, Well  the tough thing is  she really wants to have sex with me.
Chandler, Crazy bitch.
Joey, Yeah  well  I still got a week left to go in the program  and according to the rules  if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments  if you know what I mean.

Joey, What do you mean?
Monica, Y'know  just be there for her.
Joey, Not following you.
Monica, Think about it.
Rachel, OK  I'm guessing this is from...
Rachel, Well  thank you  Melanie.
Chandler,  OK  this one right here is from me.
Rachel,  OK... ah  it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh  thank you! 
Rachel, This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
Phoebe, Oh  it's Dr. Seuss!
Joey, : That book got me through some tough times.
Chandler, Yes  the doctors say if they remove it  he'll die.
Rachel, Who's this from?
Chandler, Oh  that's Ross's.
Rachel, Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe, Remembered what?
Rachel, It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store  and I saw this pin in the window  and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler, Well  sure  but can you play it on a plane? 
Phoebe, Oh  it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica, I can't believe he did this.
Chandler, Come on  Ross? Remember back in college  when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel, What did you just say?
Chandler,  ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel, No  no  no.... the  um  the... 'love' part?
Chandler,  F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel, Oh.... my God.
Chandler,  Oh  no-no-no-no-no....
Joey,  That's good  just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Rachel, I mean  this is unbelievable.
Phoebe, I know. This is really  really huge.
Chandler, No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe, Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Chandler, OK  is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica, I think this is so great! I mean  you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel, No! None! I mean  my first night in the city  he mentioned something about asking me out  but nothing ever happened  so I just... : W-well  what else did he say? I mean  does he  like  want to go out with me?
Joey, Well  given that he's desperately in love with you  he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel, Ross? All this time? Well  I've got to talk to him. 
Chandler,  H-He's in China!
Joey, The country.
Monica, No  no  wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler, What about the time difference?
Monica, From here to the airport?
Chandler, Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
Monica, Rachel  what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel, I-I-I don't know.
Chandler, Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Joey, He's right  cause if you're just gonna  like  break his heart  that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Monica, Yeah  but if it's good news  you should tell him now.
Rachel, I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe, Here  look  alright  does this help?
Rachel, Noooo... look  all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean  this is just too big. Y'know  I just  I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK  I'll see you later. 
Chandler, Rachel  I love you! Deal with me first! 
Ross, 
Ross, Ni-chou chi-ma! 
Rachel, Ross! Excuse me  pardon me  excuse me....
Rachel, Hi.
Rachel, Oh  no  no  I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Rachel, No  I know  but I—he just went on. He's right there  he's got the blue jacket on  I... can I j-just...
Rachel, OK  alright  OK  um... then could you please  uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Rachel, Uh... I don't know.
Joey, Heh  heh. It was nothin'.
Joey,  Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's  uh... let's give you another turn.
Joey, Sure! Why not?
Joey, How do you mean?
Monica, Uh  so  uh  Rach  uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper  I mean  it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Rachel, I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there  and I thought about it all the way back... and  uh  oh  you guys  y'know  it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean  it's Ross.
Rachel, I don't know  I mean  this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh  I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica, Oh my God  me too! Oh! Oh  we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean  it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe, Yeah  but  y'know  it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Monica, Another good point.
Phoebe, No  I mean  I mean  when you're at the fifteenth date  y'know  you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know  it's... you're committed.
Rachel,  Huh?
Phoebe, Well  I mean  then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica, Why isn't it working out?
Rachel, I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica, Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel, No!
Monica, Does he not make enough money?
Rachel, No  I'm just....
Phoebe, Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel, Wha...
Monica, Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel, No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica, Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Chandler, Hey  big...
Joey, Shhhh!
Chandler,  ...spender.
Joey, She's still asleep.
Chandler, So how'd it go?
Joey, Oh  it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler, The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey, Well  it's like  last night  I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man  oh man  it was like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler, Yes  I know  as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Joey, It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me  too. It's like  all of a sudden  I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened  y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler, I didn't know you had another level.
Joey, I know! Neither did I!
Monica, Hey  great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Oh  from who?
Rachel, From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica, Well  it's the thought. Hey  doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel, Uh  yeah. Uh  Monica  y'know  honey  I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing  it's just not a good idea.
Monica, Oh  why?
Rachel, Because  I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh  and there would just be all this pressure  and I don't wanna...
Monica,  No  no  no  no  no  no pressure  no pressure!
Rachel, Monica  nothing has even happened yet  and you're already so...
Monica, I am not 'so'! OK  I was a teensy bit weird at first  but... I'll be good. I promise.
Rachel, Who is it?
Rachel, C'mon up.
Monica, Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Joey, Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler, Alright  you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey, Man  hell of a two weeks  huh? Y'know what  though? I really feel like I learned something.
Chandler, Really? So  you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey, What  are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back  does he walk around like this? 
Ross, I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel, Would you excuse me  please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross, Fine  just stop thinking about me.
Ross, Can't do it  can you?
Rachel, So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross, I don't get it. What do you see in this guy  anyway?
Rachel, Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Ross, Rachel  come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel, Ross  it's too hard.
Ross, No  no  no... why  because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look  I-I've been in love with you since  like  the ninth grade.
Rachel, Ross  you're like my best friend.
Ross, I know.
Rachel, If we broke up  and I lost you...
Ross, Whoa  whoa  whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel, Well  have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross,  No. But... it only has to happen once. Look  you and I both know we are perfect for each other  right? I mean... so  the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Rachel, I don't know... I mean  I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross, Well  start looking.
Rachel, Wow.
Rachel, Right! You're right!
Rachel, You know what?
Rachel, I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay  and finish your drinks  please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
Rachel,  Excuse me  pardon me  excuse me  excuse me  sorry. Hi.
Ross, Oh  hey  hey  I got that.
Ross, No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, No  no  they will. I just... uh...
Ross, Come on  they're gonna love you.
Phoebe," Ok  so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since  you know  forever  but every time he tried to tell her  something kind of got in the way  like cats  and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig  Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like  ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back  but what she didn't know was  that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So  that's pretty much everything you need to know. But  enough about us. So  how've you been?"
Rachel, Oh my god. Oh my god.  Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! 
Ross,  Rach!
Rachel, Oh  there you are! Hi! Oh  so  so  how was China  you? 
Ross, It was  it was great. Oh  what happened?
Rachel, What?
Ross, You're bleeding.
Rachel, I am? Oh  look at that  yes I am. Enough about me  enough about me  Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything. 
Ross, Well  where do I start? This is Julie. Julie  this is Rachel.
Rachel, These are  these aren't for you.  These are for you.  Welcome to our country.
Rachel, Ok  well  not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
Chandler,  No way!
Monica, I'm telling you  she went to the airport  and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Phoebe, Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like  all right  what's bigger than huge?
Joey, Um  this?
Phoebe, Yes.
Monica, Guys  you got your hair cut.
Chandler, Yes  yes  we did  thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Phoebe, 'Cause  you know   if you don't look good  we don't look good. I love that voice.
Rachel,  Airport  airport. Ross  not alone  Julie  arm around her. Cramp  cramp.
Chandler, Ok  I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick  get the verbs.
Rachel,  You  you  you said he liked me.  You  you slowpokes!
Ross, That's all right  Rach  we got the bags. Hi  hello. Julie  this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey  what up?
Joey, What up?!
Ross, Everyone  this is Julie.
Rachel,  Julie.
Ross, And bus.
Ross,  The screaming guy?
Ross, You gotta hear this story.
Ross, 200 at least.
Rachel, And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh  I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending  didn't I? Oh! It's just  I just heard this story in the cab  and it is all I can think about.
Monica, This is amazing. I mean  how  how did this happen?
Ross, But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China  guess who's in charge of the dig.
Rachel, Julie! Julie  isn't that great? I mean  isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch  spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Monica,  It's an expression.
Ross, Well  we just wanted to say a quick hi  and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Ross, Yeah  it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Chandler, Well  listen  don't tell us what's gonna happen though  'cause I like to be surprised.
Rachel, Bye. 
Ross, Hey  Rach  can I get some coffee?
Rachel, Yeah  sure.
Ross, Thank you.
Chandler, Hey  Rach  can I get...
Rachel, Did you talk to him?
Chandler, Not yet.
Rachel, Then  no.
Chandler, So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean  when last we left you  you were totally in love with  you know.
Ross, I know  I know I was  but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen  move on. You know whose voice that was?
Chandler, God?
Ross, It was you  pal.
Chandler, Well  maybe it was God  doing me.
Ross, Look  you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend  that's all. But then I met Julie  and I don't know  we're havin' a great time. And I have to say  I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Chandler, Well  you owe me one  big guy.
Rachel,  Here's your lemonade.
Ross, I didn't order lemonade.
Rachel, Oh. Well then  you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Ross, But...
Rachel, Go-go-go-go  come on!   So uh  what did you find out?
Chandler, He said...he said  he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But  the silver lining  if you wanna see it  is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
Rachel, How is that the silver lining?
Chandler, You have to really wanna see it.
Ross, Ironically  these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Monica, Pheebes  you know what I'm thinking?
Phoebe, Oh  ok. How  it's been so long since you've had sex  you're wondering if they've changed it?
Monica, No  although now that's what I'm thinking.
Phoebe, All right  so what were you thinking?
Monica, Well  I was thinking  that you gave the guys such great haircuts  I thought  maybe you'd like to do mine?
Phoebe, Ohh! No.
Monica, Why not?
Phoebe, Because  I'm just  I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Monica, No you're not.
Phoebe, I know I'm not  but you are  and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Joey,  Hello? Oh  hi. Yeah  hold on a second. Ross  it's Julie  for you. 
Ross,  Hello? Hi.
Chandler,  Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Joey, Needs some clothes altered?
Chandler, No  no  I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Joey, Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait  16. No  'scuse me  15.  All right  when was 1990?
Chandler, Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
Ross,  Ok  ok  sweetheart  I'll see you later. Ok  bye. What?  Oh  that is so sweet. No  no  ok  you hang up. Ok  ok  one  two  three.  Well you didn't hang up either.
Rachel, She didn't hang up either!
Ross, Ok  no  no  you hang up. You  you  y...
Rachel,  Sorry  I thought you were talking to me.
Ross, Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Rachel, Okay!
Ross,  Hi?  Sorry  we got disconnected... 
Rachel,  Ok  ok  ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago  two weeks ago  I was fine. Ross was just Ross  just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss  oh  this really great guy that I can't have.
Monica, Sweetie  I wanted you to have him too.
Rachel, I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it  I'm just gonna deal with it.  I gotta get out of here. 
Chandler, Ok  I don't care what you guys say  something's bothering her.
Joey,  You know  I think I was sixteen.
Monica,  Please  just a little bit off the back.
Phoebe," I'm still on ""no."""
Rachel,  Uh  morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
Joey, No-no-no-no-no   I'm not fallin' for that again.
Phoebe, What's goin' on?
Rachel, Well  I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
Chandler, What stupid thing did you do?
Phoebe, Ewww! 
Rachel, Ok  Paulo  why don't you just go get dressed  and then you be on your way  ok  bye-bye. 
Monica, Rachel  how did this happen?
Rachel, I don't know  I just kinda ran into him last night.
Phoebe, Where?
Rachel, At his apartment. Is this juice?
Joey, Whoa  whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Rachel, Oh God  I know I'm a pathetic loser.
Monica, Honey  you're not pathetic  you're sad.
Chandler, People do stupid things when they're upset.
Monica, My god  if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...  but this is about your horrible mistake.
Ross, Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well  there was touching.
Ross, Hey  Paulo. What are you doing here?
Ross,  So  uh  he's back.
Rachel, Yeah  he's back. Is that a problem?
Ross, No  not a problem.
Rachel, Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
Phoebe,  Ok  you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Chandler, Well  in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension  I've got pants that need to be altered.
Joey, Hey  Chandler  when you see Frankie  tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Chandler, Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Monica,  You know it's funny  the last time Paulo was here  my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Phoebe, All right. Ok  but  but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Monica, I promise.
Phoebe, All right.  Now some of you are gonna get cut  and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Phoebe, All right  that's it  I quit.
Monica, What? I didn't say anything.
Phoebe, Yeah  but this  isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok  this  is the face of a person who  you know  doesn't trust a person.
Monica, I'm sorry. I'm sorry  Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Phoebe, Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Monica, How who wears it?
Phoebe, Demi Moore.
Monica, Demi Moore is not a he.
Phoebe, Well  he was a he in Arthur  and in Ten.
Monica, That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Phoebe, Oh.  Oh!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Oh my God! I'm sorry  I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Monica, She's the actress that was in Disclosure  Indecent Proposal  Ghost!
Phoebe, Oh  she's got gorgeous hair.
Monica, I know!
Chandler, At least as long as I have the pants.
Rachel, How is she?
Phoebe, It's too soon to tell. She's resting  which is a good sign.
Ross, How's the hair?
Phoebe, I'm not gonna lie to you  Ross  it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side  which seems to have stopped the curling.
Joey, Can we see her?
Phoebe, Your hair looks too good  I think it would upset her. Ross  why don't you come on in.
Ross,  Yeah. 
Joey, How're you doing?
Rachel, I'm okay.
Joey, Ooh  that bad  huh?
Rachel, What?
Joey, Look  I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Rachel, When I saw him get off that plane with her  I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today  it's like there's rock bottom  50 feet of crap  then me.
Joey, You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Rachel, Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey, What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Rachel, I don't know  I don't know.
Joey, Look  Rach  Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact  I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is  I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Chandler,  Yo  paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!
Joey, Frankie? What're you talking about?
Ross,  Hey  what's goin' on? 
Chandler, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross, What?
Joey, No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler, Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam  and he ran his hand up my leg  and then  there was definite...
Ross, What?
Chandler, Cupping.
Joey, That's how they do pants! First they go up one side  they move it over  then they go up the other side  they move it back  and then they do the rear.  What? Ross  Ross  would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Ross, Yes  yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Joey, What? That's not?  Oh my God.
Monica, Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross, I like it. I do  I think it's a Ten. 
Monica, Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler, Come on  Monica  things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy  but it's true.
Phoebe,  Thank you.
Ross, Well  I gotta go. Bye. Bye  Rach.
Rachel,  Wait  are you leaving?
Ross," Yeah  that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
Rachel, Well  can I talk to you for a sec?
Ross, Okay. 
Joey, Hey  when the doctor does that hernia test...
Chandler, That's ok.
Ross, What's goin' on?
Rachel, Well  first of all  Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did  and if I could go back in time and do it again  well  I wouldn't. Um  second of all   what?
Ross, Ok. Well  before I say anything  I just need to know  is this one of those things where you break up with a guy  and then I tell you what I think  and then the next day you get back together with the guy  and I look like a complete idiot?
Rachel, No. No-no-no-no.
Ross, Well  then  I think  I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Rachel, Really?
Ross," You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you  and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing  and adorable  and sexy you are  you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god  I'm with Rachel"". You know  someone who makes you feel good  the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?"
Rachel, No  I think that was the whole all.
Ross, Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Joey, I swear to god  Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Phoebe, Oh yeah!  Oh  I can do that.
Phoebe, You wanna do it right now?
Phoebe,  Ok  I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral  right?
Rachel, No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah. Ok  thank you.
Rachel, You're welcome.
Monica,  Ok  these were unbelievably expensive  and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like  20 minutes  but I couldn't resist. 
Phoebe, Oh  look at these! Hey  Ben. Just do it.  Oh my God  oh  ok  was that too much pressure for him?
Chandler, You know  it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. 
Joey,  I gotta get one  too.
Ross,  What are you guys doing?
Chandler, We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Ross, Look  would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Joey, Yeah  we know  but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Ross, This is my son having lunch  ok? It's gonna happen a lot  so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it  if you're uncomfortable  just ask questions. Carol's fine with it  now come on.
Ross, Carol?
Chandler, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Joey, Uh  does it hurt?
Joey, Chandler?
Chandler, So  uh  how often can you do it?
Joey, Ok  I got one  I got one. Uh  if he blows into one  does the other one get bigger?
Rachel, Yeah  I forget which ones.
Rachel,  Thank you.  What a bitch.
Phoebe, I can't  I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Monica, Ok  um  I'll go with you.
Ross,  Hi  honey.
Chandler, Hey  sweetums.
Ross, Hello to the rest.
Joey, Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Monica, It's gonna be a problem  isn't it?
Chandler, Come on  you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica, But I'm...
Phoebe, Monica  she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Ross,  So  uh  Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Monica, Yeah  uh  it's actually not that big a deal.
Ross, It's a big deal to me. This is great  Monica. I really appreciate this.
Monica, You're welcome.
Phoebe, Woof  woof.
Joey,  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Hey Annabelle.
Joey, Who?
Joey, What's he doin' in my section?
Joey, Well  he's gonna. I'll see you a little later  ok?  Hey  how ya doin'?
Joey, Listen  I know you're new  but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Joey, Yeah. Bijan for men?
Monica, Phoebe  listen. You were with me  and we were shopping all day.
Phoebe, What?
Monica, We were shopping  and we had lunch.
Phoebe, Oh  all right. What did I have?
Monica, You had a salad.
Phoebe, Oh  no wonder I don't feel full.
Rachel,  Hey  guys  what's up.
Phoebe, I went shopping with Monica all day  and I had a salad.
Rachel, Good  Pheebs. What'd you buy?
Phoebe, Um  we went shopping for um  for  fur.
Rachel, You went shopping for fur?
Phoebe, Yes  and then I realized I'm against that  and uh  so then we bought some   uh  boobs.
Rachel, You bought boobs?
Phoebe,  Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Joey,  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?  Bijan for...   Hey  Annabelle  Uh  listen  I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Joey,  Hey  it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.  Bijan for men?  Bijan for men?!
Ross, Carol  we've been through this before  ok? We have a good time. We laugh  we play. It's like we're father and son.
Rachel, Oh  this is so cute.
Ross, My mommies love me. That's clever.
Monica, Hello? Oh  Hi  Ju——Hi  Jew!   Uh huh?  Uh huh?  Ok.  Um  sure  that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. 
Rachel, Did you just say Hi  Jew?
Monica, Yes. Uh  yes  I did. That was my friend  Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah  he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Phoebe, Ben  dinner!
Ross, Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey  you didn't microwave that  did you  because it's breast milk  and you're not supposed to do that.
Phoebe, Duh  I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. 
Chandler, What did you just do?
Phoebe, I licked my arm  what?
Ross, It's breast milk.
Phoebe, So?
Rachel, Phoebe  that is juice  squeezed from a person.
Joey, What is the big deal? 
Chandler, What did you just do?
Ross, Ok  would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Phoebe, You won't even taste it?
Ross, No!
Phoebe, Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Ross, Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Monica, Hey  where is everybody?
Rachel, They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Monica, Just out. Had some lunch  just me  little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Rachel, Oh  no problem. You can borrow it  by the way.  Here are your keys  hon. 
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Mon  if uh you were at lunch alone  how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Monica, You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Rachel, And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica, That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Rachel, Monica  what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Monica, Judy.
Rachel, Who?
Monica, Julie.
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Jody!
Rachel, You were with Julie?
Monica, Look  when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then  one thing led to another and  before I knew it  we were...shopping.
Rachel, Oh. Oh my God.
Monica, Honey  wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Rachel, Yeah  right.  Sure!
Monica, Really  Rachel  I was thinking of you the whole time. Look  I'm sorry  all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Rachel, Oh  please  you wanted to get caught. 
Monica, That is not true!
Rachel, Oh  so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Monica, Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Rachel, Ok  Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?  Oh! Ok  ok  ok  I just really  uh  I just really need to not be with you right now. 
Monica,  Hi  who's this?  Hi  Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.  Yes  I know I did a horrible thing.  Joanne  it's not as simple as all that  ok?  No  I don't care what Steve thinks.  Hi  Steve.
Phoebe, Oh  I tasted Ben's milk  and Ross freaked out.
Ross, I did not freak out.
Ross, Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Ross, No  no  Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just  I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Chandler, Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Ross,  That would be no.
Phoebe, Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Joey, Yeah  it's kinda sweet  sorta like  uh...
Joey, Exactly.
Ross,  You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Ross, Oh  you've tasted it.
Ross,  Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel. 
Chandler, Howdy.
Joey,  Gimme a box a juice. Well  they switched me over to Hombre.
Chandler, Well  maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Joey, Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy  Chandler  he goes through two bottles a day.
Chandler,  What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Joey, I know  but  I was the best  you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Chandler,  All right  say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Joey, Yeah I guess you're right.
Chandler, You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Joey, I'm gonna do it. 
Chandler, All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Monica, I don't know what else to say.
Rachel, Well that works out good  because I'm not listening.
Monica, I feel terrible  I really do.
Rachel, Oh  I'm sorry  did my back hurt your knife?
Monica, Rachel   say that I'm friends with her  we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Rachel, Yes.
Monica, It's that terrible?
Rachel, Yes. Monica  you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with  but now  she's actually   but now she's actually stealing you.
Monica, Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean  just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean   you're my...We're  we're...Oh  I love you.
Rachel, I love you too. 
Phoebe, You guys  um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me  but um I love you guys too.  Oh  I really needed that. 
Monica, Look  I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts  but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean  she was just a girl who met a guy  and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance  you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance  for me?
Rachel,  I'd do anything for you  you know that.
Monica,  I'd do anything for you. 
Phoebe, Wait  wait  wait  wait! 
Joey, Mornin'.  I said  mornin'.
Joey, Yeah  I'm ready.
Joey, These new kids  they never last. Sooner or later  they all...stop lastin'. Listen  uh  what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Rachel, So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean  you know  we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that  being one of the two of us  though  right?
Rachel, Really? Me?
Rachel, Well  you're not totally paranoid.
Rachel, Um  ok  uh  oh god  um  when you and uh Ross first started going out  it was really hard for me  um  for many reasons  which I'm not gonna bore you with now  but um  I just  I see how happy he is  you know  and how good you guys are together  and um  Monica's always saying how nice you are  and god I hate it when she's right.
Rachel, Yeah  that'd be great. I'd love it.
Rachel, All right  Julie.
Rachel, Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
Ross,  That's not bad.
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
Chandler, Huh. 
Ross, I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Rachel, Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Phoebe, See  I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for  um  that guy on Who's The Boss.
Rachel, What song was that  Pheebs?
Phoebe,  Hold me close  young Tony Dan-za.
Phoebe, Hi Monica!
Ross, Hey Mon!
Rachel, Hey Mon!
Phoebe, Oh my God  has she slept at all?
Ross, Nope.
Rachel, No  it's been three nights in a row.
Ross, Yeah  she finally stopped crying yesterday  but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace  so.
Phoebe, Oh  okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning  but all I could hear was  like  this high squeaky sound  so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Chandler, Morning.
Joey, Morning  hey  you made pancakes?
Chandler, Yeah  like there's any way I could ever do that.
Joey,  Good morning.
Chandler, Hey  you know what  here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Chandler, I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Chandler, Well  maybe I won't kiss you  and then you'll have to stay.
Joey,  Kiss her! Kiss her!
Joey, B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler, Nope  not this time.
Joey, Come on  quite yankin' me.
Chandler, I'm not yanking you.
Joey, This is Janice.
Chandler, Yeah  I know. She makes me happy.
Joey, Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me  without blinking  that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Chandler,  I'm not breaking up with her! 
Monica, God  look what I found in the drain.
Rachel, What?!
Monica, It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this?
Ross, Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica, It's weird  but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him  gross  drain hair. Ooh! 
Phoebe, Ooh. Oh. It looks like  like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. 
Monica, God  what is wrong with me.
Ross, You need to get some sleep.
Monica, I need to get some Richard.
Rachel, Monica  you broke up with him for a reason.
Monica, I know  I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
Phoebe, Maybe  because you told him not to.
Monica, What are you the memory woman?
Joey,  Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel, Well  you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together  they're really cute.
Joey, Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel, Yes  Joey  I remember  she's annoying  but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
Joey, There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross, Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy  so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
Joey, Yeah  we'll call that Plan B. All right?
Rachel,  Honey  I was wondering....
Ross, Hmm?
Rachel, Do you still have that  um  Navy uniform?
Ross, Nooo  I had to return it to the costume place.
Rachel, Hmm.
Ross, I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Rachel, You remember not having sex in high school  right?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Well honey  what about you?
Ross, What?
Rachel, I mean do you have any fun  you know  fantasy type things?
Ross, No.
Rachel, Come on you gotta have one!
Ross, Nope.
Rachel, Ross  you know what...
Ross, What?
Rachel, ...if you tell me  I might do it.
Ross, Okay  umm. Did you ever see  um  Return Of The Jedi?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Do you remember the scene with  um  Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as  as his prisoner  um  Princess Leia.
Rachel, Oooh!
Ross, Princess Leia  was wearing this  um  gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Phoebe, Yeah  oh  Princess Leia and the gold bikini  every guy our age loved that.
Rachel, Really!
Phoebe, Um  um. It's huge. Yeah  that's the moment  when-when  you know she stopped being a princess  and became  like  a woman  you know.
Rachel, Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  um-mm. Oh!
Rachel, Really! That-that great huh?
Phoebe, No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi you guys!
Ross, Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Rachel, Mon. Hi!
Monica, Hi.
Rachel, Why aren't you at work?
Monica, Oh  they-they sent me home.

Monica, Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Ross, Okay.

Monica, I know I do.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, Guess what?
Rachel, What?
Ross, They published my paper.
Rachel, Oh  really  let me see  let me see.
Phoebe, Rach  look!  Oh  hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Wheel!
Chandler, Of!
Joey, Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!
Chandler, You know  you should really go on this show. All right  listen  I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
Joey, I say  'I am there!' Cool! Aw  is Ross going to?
Chandler, No  Janice.
Joey, Jan-ice. 'Cause I  just  I feel bad for Ross  you know  we-we always go together  we're like the three hocke-teers.
Chandler, You know  I may be way out on a limb here  but do you  do you  have a problem with Janice?
Joey, No  Yeeees. God  how do I say this. . Oh  hi  you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
Chandler, Ooh  that girl that I hate  eww  drives me crazy  eww  eww  oh!
Joey, Look  I don't hate Janice  she's-she's just a lot to take  you know.
Chandler, Well  there you go.
Joey, Oh  hey. Come on man  don't look at me like that  she used to drive you nuts before too  remember?
Chandler, Well  I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry  those are the right letters.
Joey, Look  what do you want me to say?
Chandler, I want you to say that you like her!
Joey, I can't. It's like this chemical thing  you know. Every time she starts laughing  I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Chandler, Thanks for trying.  Oh  and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Joey, Yeah  then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? 
Ross, How could you have told her?
Rachel, Ross  I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Ross, Oh  she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
Rachel, Okay  who are you talking to when you do that?
Ross, Look  that was supposed to be like a private  personal thing between us.
Rachel, Okay  Ross  Phoebe is my girlfriend  okay  we tell each other everything. You know  I mean  come on  guys do the same thing  I mean  what about all that locker room stuff.
Ross, That's different  okay. That's like  uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
Rachel, Were both of those Joey?
Ross, Yeah. Look  you don't  you don't talk about like  you know  your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you  you do with her.
Rachel, Not even with your best friend.
Ross, Noo!
Rachel, That is so sad. Your missing out on so much  Ross. I mean  the bonding and the sharing  you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Ross, Hmph. So what you  you tell each other everything?
Rachel, Pretty much.
Ross, Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Rachel, Uh  honey  yeah that was with Carol.
Ross, I know  but it's still worth mentioning  I think.
Phoebe,  Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay  now close you eyes  and think of a happy place. Okay  tell me your happy place.
Monica, Richard's living room  drinking wine.
Phoebe, All right. No  no  no  not a Richard thing  just put down the glass. And get out!
Monica, I'm sorry  but that's my happy place.
Phoebe, Well  okay  fine  use my happy place. Okay  I'm just gonna  I have to ask that you don't move anything.
Monica, All right  I'll try not to.
Phoebe, Okay  all right  so  your in a meadow  millions of stars in the sky....
Monica, Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Phoebe, All right  there are no questions in the happy place. Okay  just  the warm breeze  and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
Monica, I'll bet he's totally over me  I'll bet he's fine.
Phoebe, All right  betting and wagering of any kind  are  I'm sure  not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just  you know  the-the lovely waterfalls  and the  the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Monica, Okay  this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
Joey, I  ah  I never said hate  I was very careful about that.
Joey, And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Joey, But what does that gonna do...
Joey, Okay. I'm in.
Joey, Does it have to be a whole day?
Joey, Yeah  I know  I sleep in the next room.
Monica,  So  I went down to the post office  and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
Phoebe, Monica  do you want us to take you home?
Monica, Uh  huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far  far away. 
Ross, Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Chandler, Umm  yeah.
Ross, No Chandler  everything! Like stuff you like  stuff she likes  technique  stamina  girth....
Chandler, Girth? Why  why  why  wh-why  why  why  why would they do this?
Ross, Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly  you know  we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
Chandler, We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Ross, Nooo!
Chandler, Yeah  okay.
Ross, Yeah?
Chandler, Yeah! All right! You go first.
Ross, Okay  okay  I'll go first.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, So  uh  the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies  and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
Chandler, Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Ross, Yes!
Chandler, I know!
Ross, Yes! Wow  well  that-that was easy. Okay  you-you go.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, Okay.
Chandler, Okay  you know  you know when your in bed  with a woman.
Ross, Hmph.
Chandler, And  ah  you know  your fooling around with her. And you get all these like  mental images in your brain  you know  like Elle MacPherson  or that girl at the Xerox place....
Ross, With the belly-button ring? Oh  muhawa!
Chandler, I know  And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom  get outta here!' You know  but of course  like  after that you can't possibly think of anything else  and you can't  you know  stop what your doing. So it's kinda like  you're  you know. You know.... You don't know!
Ross, Your Mom  your telling me  your telling me  about your Mom  what is the matter with you?
Chandler, You said...
Ross, I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, What are you guys doing together?
Chandler, Really.
Joey, Yeah  yeah. We went to a Mets game  we got Chinese food  and you know  I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
Chandler, You still can't stand her can you?
Joey, I'm sorry man  I tired  I really did.
Chandler, Well  you know  I appreciate you giving it a shot.
Joey, But  hey  look  you know the good thing is  is that we spent the whole day together and I survived  and what's even more amazing  so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
Chandler, Well  I guess that's something.
Joey, No man  that's huge! Now  I know I can stand to be around her  which means I get to hang out with you  which is kinda the whole point  anyway.
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, Oh  hey  Chandler  we  ah  we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Chandler, Oh God!
Joey, Hey  if it makes you feel any better  I do it too.
Chandler, Really?
Joey, Oh yeah  I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.
Monica, Hi  Dad  what are you doing here?
Monica, I don't  I just  I just like the smell of them. So  uh  what are you really doing here Dad?
Monica, What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Monica, Oh.
Monica, I'm fine  just a little tired  I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Monica, No  I really  really do.
Monica, Really!
Monica, You're not just saying that are you?
Monica, Was he crying?
Monica, Well  do you think he was waiting 'til after you left  so he could cry?
Monica, I think so.
Rachel, Okay  here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner  and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey  what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
Ross, No  no it's  um  it's not you  um  it's um  it's 
Ross, I hate Chandler  the bastard ruined my life. 
Joey, All right they got water  orange juice  and what looks like cider. 
Chandler, Taste it.
Joey,  Yep  it's fat. I drank fat!
Chandler, Yeah  I know  I did that two minutes ago.
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey  mister tux!
Ross, Why aren't you guys dressed?
Joey, We have a half hour.
Ross, No  four minutes ago you had a half hour  we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Joey, Relax Ross  we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Ross, Well  you know  I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Rachel,  Hey-hey! Oh  look at you  all sexy.
Ross, Really.
Rachel, Ooooh! Wow!! Oh  hi.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, How come you didn't come over earlier?
Ross, 'Cause  I'm a stupid  stupid man.

Ross, No.  So  um  let's see your pretty close  huh. Make-up's on  hair's done.
Rachel, Yeah  I just have to get dressed.
Ross, Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Rachel, Yeah! Once  I figure out what I'm wearing.
Joey, Glass of fat?
Joey, What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
Ross, No! Do you wanna hear it?
Joey, Am I in it?

Joey, How is this your seat?
Chandler, 'Cause I was sitting there.
Joey, But then you left.
Chandler, Well  it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom  you knew I was coming back.
Joey, What's the big deal  sit somewhere else.
Chandler, The big deal is I was sitting there last  so  that's my seat.
Joey, Well  actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
Ross, You guys  you know what  you know what  it doesn't matter  because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
Chandler, All right  Ross  I just have to do one thing  really quickly  it's not a big deal.  GET UP!!

Ross, Look  our table is down in front  okay  my boss is gonna be there  everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Monica, Has somebody been drinking my fat? 
Rachel,  You guys   does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
Phoebe, I don't know  you might be the first one.
Monica, Rach  did you check the machine?
Rachel, Uh  no. Wait  you know what  this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Chandler, Well  Joey  I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
Joey, All right! You can have the chair.
Chandler, Really!
Joey, Oh my  would you look at that! 
Phoebe,"  ""Hi  it's me  I'm coming over now. Hey  what if I'm already there when your playing this message?""  Is that too spooky?"
Ross,"  ""Hi Rach  are you there? It's me  pick up. Rachel. Rach!"""
Rachel,  What?!
Ross, Nevermind.
Monica, Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!
Ross, It's old  it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the  the double beep?
Monica, What if it's new? I mean  we agreed not to talk again  unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Chandler, Honey  you did call him back. 'Cause  it's  it's really old.
Ross, Yeah  see Mon  listen  listen. When Carol and I broke up  I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Monica, Huh?
Ross, I.....got.....dressed. Really  really quickly. Okay  okay.  There we go  there we go.
Chandler, You know what  okay  fine. Don't get up  you just sit right there. I just hope  you don't mind  you know  my hand right here.  Op  not touching  can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! 
Phoebe, Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Joey, I'm so sorry.
Phoebe, What am I gonna do?
Ross, No  no  don't  don't  rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
Phoebe, Monica  Monica  you know what gets out hummus.
Monica, If it is a new message  what is he calling to say?
Phoebe, Okay  thanks. Yeah  I'll try that.
Chandler, Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Monica, So  should I call him back?
Chandler, All right  fine  you know what  we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo  comfortable.
Joey, Me too. In fact  I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Chandler, All right! 
Ross, Okay  look  we have nineteen minutes. Okay  Chandler  I want you to go and change! Okay. And then  when you come back  Joey will go change  and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Chandler, All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting  and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! 
Rachel,  Is this a little too...  Pheebs  what happened?
Phoebe, Hummus. I got the hummus.
Rachel, Ooooh! Honey  well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Phoebe, That won't go with this dress though.
Rachel, No  you're right. Well  we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Ross, No  no  no  no  no  no  not out of that  not out of clothes.
Rachel, Monica  can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Monica, I called him.
Monica, Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay  it's okay  it's okay  because you know it was like a casual  breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God  what if it wasn't breezy?
Phoebe, Well  how could it not be breezy  no  'cause  you're  you're in such a breezy place.
Monica, Here  I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys  and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Joey, Monica  how are you gonna do that?
Monica, I know the code to his answering machine.
Ross, Okay  Mon  I really don't think this is the... Okay  you're dialing  you are dialing.
Joey, Wow  what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please  pass the pie.'
Monica,"  ""Hi  it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So  I'm just checkin'. So let me know  or don't  whatever. I'm breezy."""
Joey, Hey  you can't say you're breezy  that  that totally negates the breezy.
Joey, Now she sounded breezy.
Monica, He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Phoebe, Monica  you don't know that.
Monica, Well  who's voice was that?
Chandler, Maybe it was his sister's. You know  maybe it was his daughter's.
Monica, Michelle! Of course  it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
Ross, Oh  great. It's starting to rain  that will make it easy to get a cab.
Monica, It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Rachel, Pheebs  you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work  you can wear my gray silk one. Oh  gosh  what am I wearing?!
Ross, You don't  you don't know what your wearing?
Rachel, Well  hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
Ross, Yeah  which  which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right  come on  I'll just pick something out for you.
Chandler," All right  you will notice that I am fully dressed. I  in turn  have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne  ""Get out of my chair  dillhole!"""
Joey, Okay. 
Chandler, What are you doing?
Joey, You said I had to give you the chair  you didn't say anything about the cushions.
Chandler, The cushions are the essence of the chair!
Joey, That's right! I'm taking the essence.
Chandler, Oh-ho  it'll be back. Oh-ho  there's nobody in the room.
Ross, Look  I'm sorry  I thought it looked pretty.
Rachel, Ross  that was a Halloween costume  unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
Ross, Look  I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Rachel, Yeah  which  by the way Chandler  I would like back one of these days.
Phoebe, Oh Rach  good  listen isn't this perfect for me! 
Rachel, Oh  it's perfect! But not for tonight.
Phoebe, Well  of course not for tonight. Yeah  hi!
Ross, Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what  what  what  are you doing?
Rachel, No honey  we're sorry  we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
Chandler, We used them as pillows when we went camping.
Ross, What?
Chandler,  The sheep.
Ross, Hey  what you do on your own time...
Joey,  Where's my underwear?!
Ross, Whoa  whoa  whoa. Come on  come on  what. You took his underwear?
Chandler, He took my essence!
Ross, Okay  now hold on. Joey  why  why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Joey, Because  I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Ross, Okay  then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Joey, It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Chandler, Well  then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Joey, Okay  you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Chandler, What are you  what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Joey, Hey  opposite  is opposite! 
Chandler, He's got nothing!
Phoebe,  Okay  I'm ready.
Phoebe, Rachel  didn't have anything that I liked  so  but she had this Christmas ribbon  and I thought  'All right  fine I'll be political.'
Chandler, What are you supporting?
Phoebe, Duh!! Christmas!
Ross, Okay  hey  that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha  my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay  see  the  the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7:33  I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
Rachel,  Okay  Pheebs  quick  what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
Ross, Just  just  just pick one!
Phoebe, Okay  okay  okay  the black. But  oh  do you have black  with the little strappys?
Rachel, Yeahh  but  but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
Ross, Yeah  pants  what  what an idea. Or better yet  um  how 'bout you go without any pants. Look  I don't know what you're trying to do to me  but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet  okay. No  no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
Rachel, But I...
Ross, No  no  no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
Rachel, All right.
Ross, Thank you!
Monica,  Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry  I just have to.
Ross, It was  it was her voice.
Chandler, Monica  I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Monica, Okay. That was her right?
Phoebe, Definitely.
Monica, See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay  I'll get dressed now.
Ross, Yay!
Phoebe, I'll get it  okay.  Hi  Monica and Rachel's.  Yeah  just a second  can I ask who's calling.  Oh  ew  it's Michelle! Ew! She  she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Monica,  Uh  Michelle. Yeah  that was me  I-I dialed your number by mistake.  Oh  you're so sweet. Yeah  we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well  you know how it is  it's that....
Chandler,  You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower  he always put a towel around his waist. I mean  what is that about?
Monica,  Michelle  I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look  yeah  you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean  you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
Ross, No  no  no  no. Tick  tick  tick  tick.
Monica, Okay  fine. 
Chandler, They got a phone in there  right?
Phoebe, Okay  we're on it. We're on it.
Ross, Um. I know it says black tie optional  but  um this may be pushing it a little  um.
Rachel, I'm not gonna gooo.
Ross, You're not going to go.
Rachel, No  I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Ross, How  how  um how can you not be going?
Rachel, I'm not gonna gooo  so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Ross, Um  you know  just out of curiosity...
Rachel, Well  ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends  I'm just  I don't know  not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Ross, Right. Right  okay  okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Rachel, It's fine.
Ross, No  but  your-your mad.
Rachel, I'm not mad.
Ross, No.
Rachel, I'm just not going.
Ross, Your not going.
Rachel, Right.
Ross, Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Rachel, Um  hum.
Ross, Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Rachel, No.
Ross, No  because your not upset.
Rachel, Right.
Ross, About the yelling.
Rachel, Right  and the humiliating.
Ross, Oh  well of course  the humiliating. So  so wee  we're okay.
Rachel, Um  hum.
Ross, We're good.
Rachel, Right.
Ross, Okay. Honey?
Rachel, Yes  Ross. 
Ross, I love you. 
Phoebe,  Get away from that! No!  She's just getting dressed.
Chandler, Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Joey, Okay  buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes  I'm wearing everything you own.
Chandler, Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Joey, Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Chandler, Oooo-ooh!
Joey, Yeah. Whew  it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah  I better not do any  I don't know  lunges. 
Ross, Okay  okay. Enough  enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Chandler, Jeez  what a baby.
Joey, Yeah  Ross  way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Ross, You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed  is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach  I'm sorry. Okay. Look  I-I wa  I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there  I need you there. Look  what  what can I do that can show you how much  how much I want you to be there.
Joey, You could drink the fat.
Ross, Hi  welcome  to an adult conversation.
Rachel, No  no  no  now wait  wa  wa  waa-it a minute  wait a minute  wait a minute  wait a minute. That actually  uh  that sounds interesting.
Ross, What?
Rachel, I think you should drink the fat.
Joey, Yaaaay!
Ross, Okay  okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me  and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Phoebe, Oh  wait  let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Ross, I think this will be fine. Okay  vanilla milkshake  just a vanilla milkshake  with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. 
Rachel, No  no  no  wait! Okay  okay. Don't! I'll go  I'll go!
Ross, You will?!
Rachel, You were really gonna do that  weren't you?
Ross, Well  yeah.
Rachel, You were gonna drink the fat.
Joey, Let's see what else he'll do!
Ross,  How 'bout instead you  go get changed!  You  give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab  and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Chandler, Stop it. Stop it!
Phoebe, Ross  went to get a cab so we can all... No  wh-what are you doing! No  Monica  no!
Monica, Not any more!
Monica, Hi  uh  Richard it's Monica  um  listen I did something kind of crazy tonight  um  maybe I'm getting my period or something  I don't know. Um  anyway  I  I  I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that  that freaked me out  and um  you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I  I  um  I'm sorry  okay  I  I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay  bye.
Monica, Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not  outgoing!!!
Monica,"  ""Hi  uh  Richard it's Monica  um  listen I did something kind of crazy tonight  um  maybe I'm getting my period or something  I don't know."" Nooo!!"
Phoebe, How did you do that?
Monica, I don't know!
Monica, Noooo!!!!
Ross,  Okay  okay  okay  I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Monica, Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
Phoebe, Yeah  after this  I think he'll be doing that himself.
Ross, Rachel!!  Wow! You  uh  you look  wow!
Rachel, And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay  that was about seven seconds.
Ross, So we're a little late.
Rachel, Come on.  Oh! And  uh  by the way....
Ross, What?
Rachel, I'm going commando  too.
Ross, Awwww!!!
Ross, Wow! What a pleasure.
Chandler, Excuse me. Hi.
Chandler, Well  your kind of sitting in my seat.
Chandler, I mean  I was sitting there.
Chandler, But  I never left the room!
Chandler, All right  that's it  give me your underwear.
Joey,  WHOAA!!
Chandler,  See Joe  that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Monica, Hey  look at me. I'm making jam  been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
Ross, Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Monica, Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel, I didn't know there were docks.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, Aww  is it broken?
Joey, No  I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. 
Rachel, Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Joey, Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Chandler, Well  I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Joey, What is this? Fruit?
Rachel, Monica's making jam.
Joey, Whoa  jam! I love jam!  Hey  how come we never have jam at our place?
Chandler, Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica, I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan  a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. 
Joey, This will just be my batch.
Phoebe,  Um  that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean  all week long everywhere I look there's you.
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe, Oooh. Oh  well this is awkward.
Phoebe, Um  yeah  you want Ursula  and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
Phoebe, Oh  you're not a dingus.
Phoebe, Well  I mean look it's  it's not your fault  you know. I mean this is just what  what she does to guys  okay.
Phoebe, Wait   you know what  I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me  that I think will help you a lot. He said okay  'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
Phoebe, Um  well  get over it. So  I mean you  you just seem to be a really nice guy  you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
Phoebe, Oh  thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
Phoebe, Okay.  Okay  you don't have to walk behind me any more.
Rachel, Mon?
Ross, Mon?
Rachel,  'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
Ross, Wait a minute  look.
Rachel, What?
Ross, Look  look  look.
Rachel, What  what  what?
Ross, It's an empty apartment.
Rachel, Oooh.
Ross, We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Rachel, Honey  come on  I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh  all right  well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. 
Ross, There it is.
Rachel, Oh  oh  that's what you're talking about.  Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Chandler, Do I look fat?
Chandler, Okay  I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no  she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Rachel, Okay  walk us through it  honey  walk us through it.
Chandler, Okay  well. Janice said 'Hi  do I look fat today?' And I  I looked at her....
Ross, Whoa  whoa  whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer  it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Rachel, Nooo!
Ross, And it works both ways.
Chandler, Okay  so you both just know this stuff?
Rachel, Well you know  after about thirty or forty fights  you kinda catch on.
Ross, Okay  for instance. Let's say  Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Chandler, That's easy  baggage claim.
Ross,  Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three  you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Chandler, Okay  this is good  this is good. All right listen  I have one. Janice likes to cuddle  at night  which  you know I'm all for. But  uh  you know when you want to go to sleep  you want some space. So  uh  how do I tell her that without  you know  accidentally calling her fat or something.
Rachel, Oh honey  I'm sorry we can't help you there  'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay  I'm late for work.
Ross, Oh.
Rachel, All right are you guys gonna come down?
Ross, Uh  yeah  yeah I'll  I'm right behind you.
Rachel, Good luck Chandler.
Chandler, Thank you Rachel.
Ross, Bye sweetie.
Rachel, Bye hon.
Ross,  Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business  but there is something you can do.
Chandler, Well  I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Ross, Noo! No  not cuddlily  not me  just her. I'm like you  I need the room. Okay  come here.  Okay  you're in bed...
Chandler, Yeah. 
Ross, I'm gonna use the cushion.
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross, Okay  you're in bed. She's over on your side  cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off  and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Chandler, Okay  the old hug and roll.
Ross, Yep.
Chandler, Okay  one question.
Ross, Shoot.
Chandler, You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Joey, Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
Rachel,  You're so pretty.
Phoebe,  Hi!
Phoebe, Hey  oh  you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
Joey,  You talked to him. Are you crazy?
Phoebe, Okay  first I'm not crazy. And second  say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom  and he wasn't following me  I mean he was  but 'cause he thought I was Ursula  ick. And  that's why  that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
Chandler, Umm  not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
Phoebe, Ooh! No  no  no  no  he's not like a kook  no. He's just like this  this very passionate  incredibly romantic guy  that got like a tinsy bit carried away  you know. And we just get along really well  and he's so cute.
Ross, Oh my God  you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
Phoebe, No  I'm just gonna help him  you know  get 'de-Ursula-ized'  like you know  like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
Joey,  Hey  I didn't stalk her. I mean 
Phoebe, Okay  I asked for the news  not the weather.
Monica,  Hey guys.
Monica, Joey  this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.
Joey, Aww.  Ohh!
Chandler, Hey  Joe  I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked   or  or a big tub of jam. 
Joey, Put your hands together.
Monica, Joey  take your time with that. That's my last batch.
Joey, No more jam?!
Rachel, Well  what happened to your jam plan?
Monica, I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So  I've got a new plan now. Babies.
Chandler, Well  your gonna need much bigger jars.
Ross, What are you talking about?
Monica, I'm talking about me having a baby.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Are you serious?
Monica, Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was  I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself  what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Ross, Well  aren't you forgetin' something? What  what  what is uh  what is that guy's name? Dad!
Monica, It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with  if I have to wait another 28 years then  I'll be 56 before I can have a baby  and that's just stupid.
Chandler, That  that's what's stupid.
Monica, I don't need an actual man  just a couple of his best swimmers. And there  there are places you can go to get that stuff.
Rachel, Down at the docks again?
Chandler, Night-night.....Janice.  'Look at all that room on her side  you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay  hug and roll time. I'm huggin'  I'm huggin'  your rollin'  and....yes! Freedom!  Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay  time for the old table cloth trick  one fluid motion. Quick like a cat  quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' 
Phoebe, Oh  great. Great. You're doing great  you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah. What's this? 
Phoebe, Um  not even a little bit.
Phoebe, Oh  okay then.
Phoebe, Good. So what were you thinking?
Phoebe, Really?
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Oh  okay. 
Chandler, No  that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
Monica,"  Okay  sperm donor number 03815  come on down! Okay  he's 6'2""  170 pounds  and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
Chandler, You mean there's more than one of us.
Ross, Look  you can't do this Mon. All right  if you do this  I'm  I'm gonna  I'm  I'm gonna.....
Monica, You're gonna what?
Ross, I'm gonna tell Mom.
Rachel, Honey  I'm sorry  but he's right. I love you  but you're crazy.
Ross, Crazy.
Monica, What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
Ross,  Oh  it's not the ideal way...
Monica, Lips moving  still talking. I mean it may not be ideal  but I'm so ready. No  I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache  you know?
Joey, Check it out!! Jam crackers!
Monica, Okay  all right  how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor  born in Queens. Wow  big family  seven sisters  and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God  under personal comments: 'New York Knicks  rule!'
Joey, Yeah  the Knicks rule!
Monica, Joey  this is you!
Joey, Let me see.  Oh  right.
Rachel, When did you go to a sperm bank?
Joey, Well  right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey  Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
Chandler, And that's how you bought it?
Joey, Noooo  that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Monica, Well  honey  it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
Joey, Maybe  I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know  juice this puppy up a little.
Phoebe,  Hellooo!
Ross, How's the maniac?
Phoebe, Oh  well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Rachel, Phoebe  what are you doing?
Phoebe, Oh  no  no  no  no. You know what  he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Rachel, Pheebs  this guy has been obsessed with your sister  for God knows how long  okay  you don't just give up something like that.
Phoebe, Look  he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
Ross, You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
Phoebe, What  he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Chandler, Pheebs  wake up and smell the restraining order.
Phoebe, What are you saying I should do?
Monica, I think  that if you really like this guy  you should just trust him.
Phoebe, Thank you  Monica.
Joey, Orrr  you could follow him and see where he goes.
Monica, Oh  that's what I would do  forget mine.
Rachel, Oh my God  what happened? 
Rachel, Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Rachel,  Ross's what?
Phoebe, Yes? Yes! Oh.
Phoebe, Oh  I was just here looking for  um  my um  my part of an old sandwich. Oh  here it is! Oh. 
Phoebe, Um  perhaps. Yes! Yes  I'm sorry  I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
Phoebe, Oh well  what do you know  there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What  is this just like a freakish coincidence  or did you know she takes this train?
Phoebe, No  no  it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault  'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry  no. Okay  well  I mean  I can't date you anymore  'cause your  you know  Wow! But um  but I will definitely  definitely help you get over my sister. Okay  stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah  and  and  and  I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Phoebe, Yeah  just  okay  look I'm going. Um  come on. Op  op  behind the pillar  which way am I gonna go?
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Joey, Where you going?
Monica, To the bank.
Joey, Sperm or regular?
Monica, Sperm.
Joey, So you're really doing this  huh?
Monica, Oh yeah  picked a guy  37135.
Joey, Sounds nice.
Monica, 'Fraid so. Brown hair  green eyes...
Joey, No kiddin'  hmm.
Monica, What?
Joey, No  I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.
Monica, Really? Why?
Joey, I don't know  I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall  smart blond guys  name like.... Hoyt.
Monica, Hoyt?
Joey, It's a name  yeah. I saw you  you know  in this great house with a big pool.
Monica, Really  is he a swimmer?
Joey, He's got the body for it.
Monica, I like that.  What?
Joey, You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet  so don't pee in our pool.'  you know.
Monica, We do not have one of those signs.
Joey, Sure you do  it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.
Monica, Two girls and a boy?
Joey, Yeah!
Monica, And  and  and they wear those little water wings  you know. And they're  they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Joey, Sure!  But hey  you know this way sounds good too.
Monica, Yeah.
Joey, Oh Monica.  Wow  this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool   for like a day. .
Joey, I called the sperm bank today  they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean  I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.
Rachel, Honey  you got a little thing on your...
Joey,  Did I get it?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross,  Hello.
Rachel, Hello.
Ross,  Hey.  Uh  Chan  can I uh  can I talk to you for a second?
Chandler, Sure. What's up?
Ross, Just one uh  one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with  uh  women talk! 
Phoebe, Oh  oh! It's on again!
Joey, You guys  can we please not watch this all right.
Joey,  Oh  you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Joey, Can we please turn this off?
Rachel, Noo way  Kevin.
Ross,  Are you intrigued?
Chandler, You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Joey,  Wow  it is easy.  Now  I can have milk everyday.
Chandler, Well  it's official there are no good movies.
Monica, Perhaps  you would like me to turn like this   so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Joey,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey.
Chandler, Hey  man. What's up?
Joey, Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Chandler, Well  I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt  but  ah  it wasn't me.
Phoebe, Yes  it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay  it was me!
Joey, How is it you?
Phoebe, Well  it was just  it was all so crazy  you know. I mean  Chandler was in the closet  counting to 10  and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you  and I wrote it all down on my hand. See  all of it. 
Joey, Yep  that's my audition.
Monica, See  now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Phoebe, Yep  and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Joey, Well  Estelle tried  you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Phoebe, That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Joey, Pheebs  you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends  she only talks to agents.
Phoebe, What a sad little life she must lead. Okay  ooh .
Joey, What  what are you doing? What are you doing?
Phoebe, No  no  no  I know  I know  ooh.  'Hi  this is Katelynn  from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um  is um  Ann there for Phoebe  she'll know what it's about.'
Joey, Hang up  hang up. 
Phoebe,  'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani  apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle  no  I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right  so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment  the world does not stop.'
Chandler, Is anybody else scared?
Phoebe,  'Right  well look  um  if Joey loses this audition  that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll  what time can you see him?'  I need a pen. 
Chandler, Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
Monica, Oh  now you want a pad.
Ross, There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah  what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Ross, Yeah  it's  it's  it's cute. Why  why  why does he have it  again?
Ross, You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing  so am I.
Ross, Give daddy the Barbi! Ben  give  give me the Barbi. Okay  how 'bout  don't you want to play with the monster truck?  No. Okay  oh  oh  how about a Dino-soilder? 
Rachel, Ross  you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll? 
Monica,  I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Joey, I love that movie. 
Monica, There it is. Joey  what are you doing?
Joey, I'm sorry  it just felt nice.
Chandler,  Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Joey, Hey  I only got one good arm  you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Chandler, Just do it! Okay  it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh  that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Rachel, What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Chandler, Okay  last night at dinner  when the meals came  she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Ross, And that's bad because...  you hate chicken piccata?
Chandler, Noo.
Ross, You didn't want to share your tomatoes  tomatoes are very important to you.
Chandler, No  it's like all of the sudden  we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Rachel, Men are unbelievable.
Monica, What is it with you people! I mean  the minute you start to feel something  you have to run away?
Chandler, I know  that   that's why I don't want to go tonight  I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Monica, Oh  you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Joey, Hey  you know about that?!
Chandler, Look what do I do? I wanna get past this  I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel  to the other side!
Ross,  Where there is no fear of commitment.
Chandler, Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Joey, Well  I've never been through the tunnel myself  'cause as I understand it  you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car  right. But  it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else  you know  face your fear. It have a fear of heights  you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case  you have a fear of commitment  so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Rachel, Amazingly  that makes sense.
Chandler, You think?
Joey, Oh  yeah. Go for it man  jump off the high dive  stare down the barrel of the gun  pee into the wind!
Chandler, Yeah  Joe  I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun  I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Phoebe, Oh  it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?
Rachel, Sure Pheebs  you know  that's what it's there for  emergencies and pretend agents.
Joey, Come on baby  come on!
Phoebe,  'Hi  I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay  well  um  she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'
Rachel, Very nice touch.
Phoebe,  'Okay  go ahead.'  Um  hi Annie.  Fantastic!  You got it.  Oh  okay  um  'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well  I don't know about that   except that I do and he will. Great  oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you  how about we have lunch next.... Op  went through a tunnel.
Rachel, Unbelievable.
Joey, Thank you so much.
Phoebe, It was really fun  I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.
Joey, You were amazing  could you just do me this huge favor  you see there's this one other audition that I really  really want  and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Phoebe, Oh  I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.
Joey, Come on  please  it'll be just this one more  well actually it's two.
Phoebe, Two?
Joey, Yeah! Well  well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Phoebe, Okay  I'll do it  but just these three  right
Joey, Nooo  four.
Chandler, 'Cause  I wanted to uh  give you this. 
Chandler, Well  wait there's  there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See  the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Chandler, Yes  I did. Yes  I did. Because  you're my girlfriend  and that's what girlfriends should  should get.
Chandler, Well  not me. But that's what's happened  and  ah  and  and there's more. We should take a trip.
Chandler, Yep  we're a couple and that's what couples do. And  I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
Chandler, I am  I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place  and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
Chandler, It doesn't scare me!
Chandler, Oh  no  no  no  don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless  and awkward  and desperate for love!!  Hey  Janice! It's me. Um  yeah  I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street. 
Rachel, Honey  this will help. 
Chandler, So  I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Monica, That is never good.
Chandler, Then I got all needy and clingy.
Rachel, Okay  wait a minute  wait a minute  wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
Chandler, She said she'd call me.
Chandler, Oh God.
Monica, Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler, This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel, Yeah  well that's that lo-cal  non dairy  soy milk junk. We sort of  we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.
Monica, You know  when you start get screwed over all the time  you gotta switch to low-fat.
Rachel, Yeah  you do.
Chandler, So  you don't think I'm terminal?
Monica, Well  no  not at all  you're not terminal  you just  you just need some damage control.
Chandler, Okay  okay. So  should I call her?
Rachel, This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone  then you go shoe shopping  you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.
Monica, She has to know that your not ready.
Rachel, Right. So  what you have to do is  you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.
Chandler, So I'm not  not gonna lose her?
Rachel, Oooh  honey  you're not a total loser.
Chandler, I said  'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land  Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi  drop the Barbi.
Rachel, G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey,  G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross, Look Ben  it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Phoebe,  Helloo! Oh! 
Joey, Pheebs! There you are!
Phoebe, No it's not  sorry.
Joey, But Phoebe  wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe! 
Phoebe, Oh  Joey! Oh  okay  see I didn't recognize you wearing  in those....pants.
Joey, Look listen  that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Phoebe, Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay  I mean you didn't get it  I'm sorry  I'm sorry.
Joey, It's okay  these things happen.
Phoebe, But they shouldn't happen  you know what  you're  you're in a terrible  terrible business. Oh God  I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Joey, I'm  I'm okay. See. 
Phoebe, Oh  now you're sad and creepy  oh. You know what  I  I'm sorry I quit  okay  I just quit.
Joey, No! No  no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs  rejection is part being an actor  you can't take it personally.
Phoebe, Not personal  really  well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Joey, They actually said that?
Phoebe, Yeah. Ooh God  there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Joey, No  no  no  see that's why you have to do this job  agents always lie. You know  Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way'  but this  I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.
Phoebe, Yeah okay  no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Ross,  You'll never get me  Joe!!! 
Chandler,  Hello  Janice.
Chandler,  Oh  just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Chandler,  No. Not anymore.
Chandler, Yeah  huh. I'm just uh  you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. 
Chandler, Well  I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Chandler, Here in Chelsea.
Chandler, A woman's
Chandler,  Chelsea.
Chandler, Can I be that guy?
Phoebe, Okay  so we got some more good rejections  lots of stuff to work on.
Joey, Okay  shoot.
Phoebe, Okay  um  oh  the zoo commercial.
Joey, I didn't get it?
Phoebe, No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So  you can work on that.
Joey, Okay  what else?
Phoebe, Um  the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Joey, Oh.
Phoebe, Oh no wait  I'm sorry  that's 'pretty dumb.'
Joey, Look  it's okay  no  no  no  really  look um  I really appreciate this Pheebs  but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, Yeah  well don't get me wrong  you're a better agent than she is  but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Phoebe, Yeah  no  I understand.
Joey, You do  thanks.
Phoebe, Yeah. Sorry. 
Joey, Wait a minute.
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Wait a minute  did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Phoebe,  Oh  you caught me. I am so busted.
Joey,  That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Chandler, ....And then I just  you know  threw the bag of barley at her  and ran out of the store.
Monica, My God! Chandler  we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
Chandler, I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now  right?
Rachel, Yeah  it is.
Monica, You know what  everything's gonna be okay.
Chandler,  Hello. Hi  Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay  what do I do?
Rachel, Shhh...I don't know what to do  this is totally unprecedented.
Monica, If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, Hello!
Monica, Oh wait  you know what  I got it  I got it  pretend like you just woke up  okay  that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Rachel, Yes  and grumpy.
Chandler, What are you  stop naming dwarves!  Hello  Janice. Hi  I'm so glad that you called  I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And  it's just because I'm crazy about you  and I just got...stupid  and  and scared  and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?!
Rachel, He's soo lucky  if Janice were a guy  she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
Chandler,  I love you too.
Monica, Aw  it's soo unfair. 
Ross, Hey  I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Ross, Look  G. I. Joe's in  Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it  that's your 'too bad.'
Monica, What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi  big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
Ross, What?
Monica, Well  you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
Ross, What are you talking about?
Monica, The big hat  the pearls  the little pick handbag.
Ross, Okay  you are totally making this up.
Monica, How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Ross,  Oh God.
Monica, Wasn't there a little song?
Ross, There was no song.  There was no song!
Monica,  'I am Bea.'
Ross, Okay.
Monica, 'I drink tea.'
Ross, Okay  that's  that's enough. 
Monica, '....Won't you  won't you  won't you.... '
Ross,  Won't you dance around with me.
Monica, A-ha!!! 
Chandler,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Joey, No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
Chandler, Yeah!
Joey, Well  I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Chandler, You’re building a post office?
Joey, No  an entertainment unit  with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job  max.
Chandler, Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
Joey, Oh yeah. These are my old work pants  Sergio Valente’s.
Joey, Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Rachel,  Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Any sign of your brother?
Phoebe, No  but he’s always late.
Rachel, I thought you only met him once?
Phoebe, Yeah  I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery  y'know  ‘Frank’s always late.’
Rachel, Well relax  he’ll be here.
Phoebe, No  I know  I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead  don’t talk to my sister  Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family  y'know  kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.
Rachel, Well  actually Gunther sent me. You’re not allowed to have cups out here  it’s a thing. 
Chandler, Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
Monica, No  but he told me  he thinks your a fox.
Chandler, All right  Janice  likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Joey, Her what?
Chandler, Well  we have a deal  where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with  and the other one can’t get mad.
Ross, Ah  the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty  respect  and sex with celebrities.
Monica, So  Chandler  who’s on your list?
Chandler, Ah  Kim Basinger  Cindy Crawford  Halle Berry  Yasmine Bleeth  and ah  Jessica Rabbit.
Rachel, Now  you do realize that she’s a cartoon  and way out of your league?
Chandler, I know  I know  I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Joey, Hey  Monica  who would yours be?
Monica, First  I need a boyfriend  then I can have a list.
Joey, It’s just a game Mon.  Rach  how about you?
Rachel, Oh  I don’t know  I guess  Chris O’Donnel  John F. Kennedy  Jr.  Daniel Day Lewis  Sting  and Parker Stevenson.
Ross, Spiderman?
Rachel, Hardy Boy.
Chandler, Peter Parker.
Ross, Thank you.
Rachel, What about you honey  who would be on your list?
Ross, Well I-I-I  that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First  I’ll divide my perspective canidates into catergories....
Chandler,  What a geek!
Phoebe,  Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Phoebe, This is everybody. This is Ross.
Ross, Hey.
Phoebe, Chandler.
Chandler, Hi.
Phoebe, Joey.
Joey, Hey-hey!
Phoebe, This is Monica.
Phoebe, And this is Rachel.
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, I’m gonna get coffee.
Chandler, We don’t  really.
Rachel, Well  so  now  do you guys have a lot of big plans?
Phoebe, Oh yeah! Yeah  no  we’re gonna connect  y'know bond  and everything.
Chandler, You know  we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.
Joey, I know.
Joey, Oh  I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?
Chandler, No  you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill  you get me  you kill me!!
Joey, Calm down  do you want this unit or not?
Chandler, I do NOT want this unit!!
Joey, Well  you should’ve told me that before  I’m not a mind reader. Hey  we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.
Chandler, Fine! 
Monica, Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?
Joey, Oh Monica  listen  I ah  I saw down at the hardware store  they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Monica, Why  what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?
Joey, Nothing. It’s just old and dingy  that’s all.
Monica, I highly doubt that. 
Joey, Oh yeah. If you ah  move your hamper  you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.
Monica, I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
Joey, Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off. 
Monica, That’s a little more than I wanted to see.
Joey,  Aw! Look at that  every inch of this stuff is glued down. It’d take forever to pry this up. You should ah  you should just leave it. 
Monica, I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Joey, Eh! There you go.
Monica, You know that’s nice  y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
Phoebe,  Oh  ew!
Phoebe, Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um  can you roll your tongue? Because I can  and my Mom couldn’t  and I thought y'know  I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah. You can do it to. 
Phoebe, Oh right  yeah okay  my Mom could  and I can’t. We don’t have that....
Phoebe, Feburary 16th.
Phoebe, Wow  that’s close. When’s yours?
Phoebe, That’s the same month as Halloween. So  um  what kinda things do you like to do at home?
Ross, Okay  I’ve got three of my five.
Rachel, Three of your five  what?
Ross, Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.
Rachel, Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Ross, Yeah  it’s hard okay  I only have two spots left.
Chandler, All right  so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Ross, Okay  Elizabeth Hurely....
Chandler, Oooh-hoo  very attractive  forgiving.
Ross, Susan Sarandon.
Chandler, Eh  y'know what  she’s to political  she probably wouldn’t let you do it  unless you donated four cans of food first.
Ross, And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler, Ooh-hoo. Very hot  very sexy. But ah  y'know she’s too international  y'know she’s never gonna be around.
Rachel, So?
Chandler, So  you gotta play the odds  pick somebody who’s gonna be in the country like all the time.
Rachel, Yeah  ‘cause that’s why you won’t get Isabella Rosselini  geography.
Phoebe, Okay so  by melting  you meant melting.
Phoebe, So is it like art?
Phoebe, Um  yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?
Phoebe, Oh  well um  not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed  I think the fumes are giving me a headache.
Phoebe, G’night  bro.
Phoebe, Here.  Y'know  just in case.
Monica, What kind of karate is that?
Phoebe, No kind. He just makes it up.
Monica, So how’s it going with you guys?
Phoebe, So far  it kinda blows. I don’t know  I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know  like you and Ross  just like close and connected and....
Monica, Oh honey  we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies  and wedgies  and flying wedgies  and atomic wedgies  and.... That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.
Phoebe, Ah!!
Monica, Oh  we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.
Phoebe, Oh  how do you play the shadow game?
Monica, Oh  how do you play the shadow game?
Phoebe, I just asked you.
Monica, I just asked you.
Phoebe, I don’t have time for this.
Monica, No  that is what the game is.
Phoebe, Which you just gave up really quickly.
Chandler,  Have you seen Joey?
Monica, What’s the matter?
Chandler, Oh  just this!  Y’know what it’s my fault really  because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
Joey,  Hey  does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.
Chandler, What’s going on?
Monica, He’s retiling my floor. 
Chandler, Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Monica, Ah-ah-ah  now you started this  you will finish it.
Chandler, He started mine first!
Phoebe, Build the unit Cinderelly  lay the tile Cinderelly.
Phoebe, Yeah.  ‘Hello.  Oh my God  I totally forgot!  Well can’t someone else do it.  But  I have company.  Yeah  no look  that’s all right I’ll come in.’  Um  Frank  I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.
Phoebe, Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
Phoebe, Well  y'know we don’t call it that  but yeah!
Phoebe, All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
Phoebe, No  no  you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Phoebe, No  no  no  I wouldn’t do you myself  I mean that would be weird. Yeah  no  I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh  this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
Monica, It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?
Chandler, What  like a number?
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hi! Bye! 
Ross, Okay  I’m done with my choices  these are final. 
Rachel, Well  it’s about time.
Joey, Ooh  very official.
Ross, Oh  yeah  well y'know Chandler printed it up on his computer.
Monica, And who laminated it?
Ross, That would be me.
Rachel, All right let me see.  Uma Thurman  Winona Ryder  Elizabeth Hurely  Michelle Pfieffer  and Dorothy Hammel?
Ross, Hey  it’s my list.
Rachel, Okay honey  you do realize she only spins like that on ice.
Phoebe, Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
Phoebe, You can’t have sex with her!
Phoebe, Okay  Jasmine  can you  can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Phoebe,  So that’s what you thought I did!! God! That’s not what I do!
Phoebe, Nooo! Why would you think that?
Phoebe, Whatever  it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Phoebe, You really thought it was perfect?
Phoebe, Yeah  um  which ones in particular were great for you?
Phoebe, I don’t....
Phoebe, Right  okay  um-mm.
Phoebe, Yeah  I guess I do  yeah.
Phoebe, Well  I-I wasn’t hopping mad  y'know.
Phoebe, Okay. All right  this is my favourite part of the weekend  right now  this.
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, She wasn’t a hooker.
Chandler, Okay  on three. One....Two....
Joey, Why don’t we just go on two.
Chandler, Why two?
Joey, Because it’s faster.
Chandler, Yeah  I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.
Rachel, Oh!
Joey, All right  but in the future...
Ross, Okay!! Okay!!
Rachel, Come on!
Ross, Heavy thing  not getting lighter!
Chandler, Okay  one...two...
Joey, So we are going on two?
Chandler, Oh  good job Joe.
Joey, Wow  it’s big!
Chandler, Yeah-yeah  so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Joey, Maybe  my ruler’s wrong.
Phoebe, Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Joey, Look it’s not that bad. So what  it blocks a little of your door  a little of my door.
Chandler, Yeah  y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? 
Joey, Yeah  listen  before I forget that side is still wet.
Rachel, Okay sir  um-mm  let see if I got this right. Ah  so this is a half-caf  double tall  easy hazel nut  non-fat  no foam  with whip  extra hot latte  right?  Okay  great.  You freak.
Ross,  Thank you.
Ross, Isabella Rosselini. 
Monica, Are you serious?  Oh my God.
Ross, Damn! I can’t believe I took her off my list.
Monica, Why? ‘Cause otherwise you’d go for it?
Ross, Yeah  maybe.
Rachel, Oh-oh  you lie.
Ross, What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
Rachel, Ross  it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
Ross, Yeah  well missy  you better be glad that list is laminated.
Rachel, You know what honey  you go ahead  we’ll call her an alternate.
Ross, Okay  hold my crawler.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Rach  are you really gonna let him do this?
Rachel, Honey  he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.
Ross,  Hi! Hi  I’m Ross  you don’t know me  but I’m a big  big fan of yours. I mean  Blue Velvet  woo-oo hoo! Um  I was wondering if I could um  maybe buy you a cup of coffee?  Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Ross, Well  yeah  kinda. Um  but that’s okay  see we have an understanding  um  see we each have this list of five famous people   so I’m allowed to sleep with you. No  no  no  it’s flattery.
Ross, Oh no  no  no  wait  wait  Isabella. Don’t  don’t just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Ross, Um  yeah.
Ross, Um  no.
Ross, But  okay.
Ross, Um  see  but that’s not the final draft.
Ross, Yeah  um  okay see  you were  you were on the list but my friend  Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international  so I bumped you for Wynona Rider  local.
Ross, What?
Ross,  We’re just gonna be friends.
Joey, Y'know what?
Chandler, Umm?
Joey, I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there. 
Chandler, I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
Joey, Get out your checkbook  mister.
Chandler, Oh  I think I have the cash.
Joey, You are dogged man! I totally fit!
Chandler, Yeah  you got me.  I’m out five big ones!  Here you go.
Joey, Thank you. Cha-ching!  Oh  well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy.  And the drinks are on me!
Phoebe, Wow  it’s like a dirty math problem.
Ross, I’m sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Joey, Well  that’s really a different question.
Joey, Well  there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Rachel, Excuse me  there was no time!
Joey, Okay  but let’s say there was. How might that go?
Rachel, Does anybody need more coffee?
Ross, Yeah  I’ll take some.
Joey, Hey  there’s a dog out there!
Phoebe, Oh  that is so unfortunate.
Ross, What?
Phoebe, Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Monica,  Okay  I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh  Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
Phoebe, You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Monica, Oh  then it must’ve been you. Bye. 
Phoebe,  Bye-bye!  That’s why I moved out.
Ross, Hey  y'know while we’re on that  when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
Phoebe, I think on some levels she already knows.
Ross, Phoebe  she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night  she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning  and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
Phoebe, Okay  well maybe not on those levels.
Chandler,  Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Chandler, I’m never gonna find a roommate  ever.
Phoebe, Why  nobody good?
Chandler, Well let’s see  there was the guy with the ferrets  that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho  and yes  the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you  Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing  Bing!
Ross, So how many more do you have tomorrow?
Chandler, Two. This photographer  who seemed really dull. And this actor guy  who I’m not sure about  because when he called and I answered the phone ‘Chandler Bing ’ he said ‘Whoa-whoa  short message.’
Monica,  Ross   foot on the floor or come over no more!

Rachel, Ummm  I think it’s time to see the ring again. 
Rachel, Yeah  I know.
Rachel, Oh  I don’t know. Well maybe it’s just the idea of Barry for the rest of my life. I don’t know I think I feel like I need to have one last fling  y'know  just to sorta get it out of my system. 
Rachel, I’m serious  I really  I think I need just to have some...meaningless  sex y'know  with the next guy that I see.
Chandler, Excuse  I seem to have dropped my ball.
Rachel, Yeah  so?
Chandler,  And now I’ve picked it up again. 
Monica, Oh my God  I went to high school with her.  Rachel! Hi!

Phoebe, So what are they doing?
Ross, I don’t know  something girlie.
Phoebe,  Hey  you’re early.
Monica, What are you doing with the lamp?
Phoebe, I’m just taking it to be re-wired.
Monica, Oh  well don’t take it to the same place you took the stereo  ‘cause they’ve had that thing for over a week.
Phoebe, No  no  Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here.
Phoebe, You don’t play the oboe!
Phoebe, Then I’m gonna have to ask you to keep it down. 
Monica, Hi  again.
Joey, Hey! 
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Thank you soo  much.
Chandler, Oh  don’t thank me  thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay  I gotta get to get to work.
Monica, You want some help with that?
Joey, Oh  no thanks  I got it.  No I don’t!
Monica, Whoa! Are you okay?
Joey, Whew! Stood up to fast  got a little head rush.
Monica, It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Joey, That’s a uh  that’s a tough combination.
Monica, Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey, Like you wouldn’t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
Monica, Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Joey, Gotcha.
Monica, This place is really my Grandmother’s.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida  otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks  I’m 87 year old woman  who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?
Joey, Oh  you bet I am!
Monica,  Okay  here’s your penis!
Monica, Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Joey, You said  you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Monica, So?!
Joey, Whoa  ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Monica, Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Joey, Oh right  right.
Monica, I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade  and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Joey, Well usually...yeah! Well  not just lemonade  iced tea  sometimes juice. Well  sorry  I just  I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.
Monica, It’s okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone  not anyone I know  but... By the way I can still see it.
Monica, Pheebs?
Phoebe, Huh?
Monica, Where’s your bed?
Phoebe, It’s not in the apartment?  Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Okay  enough with the third degree! I-I’ve  I don’t live here anymore.
Monica, What are you talking about?
Phoebe, I’m sorry  I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you  but y'know everybody else knows!
Monica, Everybody knows!
Phoebe, That was supposed to be a good thing  I forget why. Just listen  Monica  I  do you know  okay  do you know  I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Monica, Well  you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Phoebe, Yeah  I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
Monica, What?!?!
Phoebe, Okay  this is what I’m talking about  this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
Monica, You can spill. In the sink.
Phoebe, Aw  honey it’s not your fault  y'know this is who you are  and I love you  and I want us to be friends  and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.
Monica, I love you  too.
Phoebe, Aww  good.  What?
Monica, What? I’m just said.
Phoebe, No you’re not  you’re wondering which cushion it is.
Chandler, So ah  whatcha watching?
Joey, Baywatch.
Chandler, What’s it about?
Joey, Lifeguards.
Chandler, Well  it sounds kinda stupid...  Who’s she?
Joey, Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Chandler, Wow! Look at them run.
Joey, They do that a lot. Hey  you want a beer?
Chandler, Yeah  I’ll go get one.
Joey, No  no  no  don’t get up  I got a cooler right here.
Chandler, Well  hello!
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.
Monica,  Help yourself.
Chandler, You okay?
Monica, Phoebe moved out.
Chandler, Right.
Monica, I don’t understand  I mean am I so hard to live  is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?
Chandler, Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t  I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.
Monica, Well  I think so.
Chandler, Oh-ho  come here.  Listen  you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known in real life.
Ross,  Hi. Where is everybody?
Phoebe, Oh  it’s already closed  Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
Ross, My marriage  I think my marriage is um  is kinda over.
Phoebe, Oh no! Why?
Ross, ‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian.  And  and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.
Phoebe, Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh  you poor bunny.
Ross,  I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it  I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d  she’d see some beautiful woman  and  and she’d be Ross y'know look at her  and I’d think  God  my wife is cool!
Phoebe, Aw! Hey  do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Ross, Well  now I do!!
Phoebe, I’m sorry.
Ross, Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years  she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me  and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....
Phoebe, Aw  God Ross. Oh.
Chandler, Umm  this is nice.
Monica, I know  it is isn’t it?
Chandler, No  I mean it  this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?
Monica, Yeah! And I got it on sale  too.
Chandler, Anyway  I should go  one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
Monica, Well  if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Chandler, Oh yeah  that sounds great.  Oh  and listen  it’s  it’s gonna be....
Monica, I know. Thanks. 
Ross, Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing  or I’d paid more attention  or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!
Phoebe, I know no  no  y'know you don’t deserve this  you don’t Ross. You’re  you’re really  you’re so good. 
Ross, Thanks.
Phoebe, And you’re so sweet.  And you’re kind 
Ross, Thanks. 
Ross, Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait.
Phoebe, Huh?
Phoebe, Okay  it’s okay.
Phoebe, Oh. 
Ross, Wait  wait  wait.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, My foot is stuck in the pocket.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, No  I can’t get it out.
Phoebe, Well  that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
Ross, No  come on don’t start.  Ouch!
Phoebe, What?
Ross, Stupid balls are in the way. 
Ross, Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.
Phoebe, You have chalk on your face.
Ross, Huh? 
Phoebe, Oh  Ross you’re right  I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.
Monica, Hey  are you okay?
Ross, My wife’s a lesbian.
Joey, Cool!!
Chandler, Ross-Joey  Joey-Ross. 
Ross, Hi.
Chandler, I can’t believe you came back.
Rachel, Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak  I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here  right now.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Oh  sorry.
Rachel, Um   Barry.
Ross, So I told Carl  ‘Nobody  no matter how famous their parents are  nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....
Rachel, I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.
Monica, Oh good  another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
Chandler, If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible  that would be the best.
Phoebe, Who’s singing?
Ross, Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days  who were you? I was always Richie.
Monica, I was always Joanne.
Joey, Question. Was ah  ‘Egg the Gellers!’ the war cry of your neighbourhood?
Phoebe, Ewww! Oh! It’s the Mattress King!
Joey, Booo!!
Chandler,  Don’t look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
Chandler, What a wank!
Monica, I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set  who cares about the divorce  those babies will sell themselves.  And I’m appalled for you by the way.
Rachel, ‘Okay.  Okay  daddy we’ll see you tomorrow night.  Okay bye-bye.’ 
Ross, We?
Rachel, Are ah  having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night  I hope that’s okay.
Ross, Oh shoot  tomorrow’s not so good  I’m supposed to um  fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Rachel, Ross  my father doesn’t hate you.
Ross, Please  he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
Rachel, But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay  look  I know  all right  just one dinner  please  just one night for me  please. I just want him to love you like I do.  All right  well not exactly like I do  but  but  if you do come to dinner  I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
Chandler,  I’ll go.
Ross, Fine.
Rachel, Thank you.
Ross, Hi Gunther.
Joey,  Hey  you guys!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Guess what?
Ross, What?
Joey, I got a gig!
Chandler, See  that’s why I could never be an actor. Because I can’t say gig.
Phoebe, Yeah  I can’t say croissant.  Oh my God!
Monica, What’s the part?
Joey, Well  it’s not a part  no. I’m teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Ross, Come on! That’s great.
Joey, Yeah  yeah. It’s like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Ross, Y’know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Joey,  I know!
Phoebe, Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband  that’s like betraying Chandler.
Monica, Not at these prices.
Phoebe,   Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!
Monica,  Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe  come here. Aw  this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Phoebe, Eh  Monica it  it feels so weird  y'know  Chandler’s your friend...  Oh! Oh my God! Aw  all right take this bed  you can make other friends.
Joey, Good evening. I’m Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um  on my first day as  Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives   I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting  this does not mean acting again  it means  you don’t have a line  but someone else just did. And it goes like this.  Thanks  thanks  a lot. Oh  by the way  before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right  moving right along.
Joey, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Joey, Oh it was great. Yeah  you get to say stuff like  ’Hey  the bell doesn’t dismiss you  I dismiss you.’
Phoebe, Ooooh  nice.
Joey, Oh  and guess what  I got an audition for All My Children.
Phoebe, Oh  yay!
Joey, Yeah  it’s this great part  this boxer named Nick. And I’m so  so right for it  y'know  he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer  and has an evil twin.
Phoebe, Oh. 
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, Oh  do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It’s that bedroom there. 
Joey, Hey  Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Phoebe, Yeah  so please  please  please  don’t say anything to Chandler.
Joey, You want me to lie to Chandler?
Phoebe, Is that a problem?
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Oh  hey  hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya  put ‘em up. Come on. 
Joey, Hey  you’re ah  pretty good at this.
Phoebe, Yeah  well I had to learn  I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.
Joey, Ahh!
Joey, Hey now!
Joey, Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.
Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh!
Joey, Okay  great.
Phoebe, Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right  all right  well I’m sorry  we’ll put some ice on it.
Joey, Okay.
Phoebe, ‘Kay  put your head back.
Joey, All right. I can’t see.
Phoebe, All right  I have ya. Oh God.
Phoebe, Oh  it’s the compulsively neat one by the window  okay.
Rachel, Hi Daddy!
Rachel, You remember Ross.
Ross, Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
Ross, Ugh  museum.
Ross, There never was a library. I mean there are libraries  its just that I ah  I never worked at one.
Ross, Yeah  if you’re really hungry.  It was a joke  I made a joke.
Rachel, Yeah  actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
Ross, It’s not a library...
Ross, So  Dr. Green  how’s the old boat.
Ross, It gives it a nice antiquey look.
Ross, Wow. I’m sorry  when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. 
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Okay! 
Rachel, Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
Ross, Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Rachel, Yeah. That’s Daddy.
Ross, That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.
Rachel, Yes  it bothers me Ross  but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house  I’d be serving him sneezers.
Ross, So?
Rachel, So. Ross  I’ve bugged him about this a million times  he’s not gonna change.
Ross, You really serve people sneezers?
Rachel, Well um  I don’t.
Ross, Thanks again  Dr. Green.
Ross, Oh  ah  you don’t need that.
Ross, The carbon  it’s messy  I mean it gets on your fingers and causes  the  the ah  night blindness.
Ross, Oh  yeah  that would be me  um  I have  I have a problem I-I tip way too much  way  way  too much  it’s a sickness really.
Rachel, Yeah it is  it is.  We really  really have to do something about that.
Ross, I know.
Rachel, Oh Daddy  no he didn’t mean anything by that  he really didn’t.
Ross, Nothing I do means anything  really.
Ross, Well Mr. Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’.
Joey, Okay  some tricks of the trade. Now  I’ve never been able to cry as an actor  so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry  I cut a hole in my pocket  take a pair of tweezers  and just start pulling. Or ah  or  let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay  let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news  well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody  class dismissed.
Joey, Hey-hey.
Joey, Awww  one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.
Joey, You bet! What’s the part?
Rachel, You had to do it  didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.
Ross, Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
Rachel, Ross  tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh  would you just see my chiropractor  already.
Ross, Yeah  I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross, Hey Pheebs  what are you doing?
Phoebe, I’m  I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right  I haven’t lived here in a while  so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Rachel, Um. yeah.
Phoebe, I am soo dead. 
Rachel, All right  look  here’s the bottom line Ross  this is fixable  if we act fast  okay. So  I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
Ross, Look  honey  I have tried to make nice  it doesn’t work.
Rachel, Okay  look  Ross  I realise that my Father is difficult  but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Ross, Look sweetie  I could be the bigger man  I could be the biggest man  I could be a big  huge  giant man  and it still wouldn’t make any difference  except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
Rachel, Okay  well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
Ross, Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it  okay we’re never gonna get along.
Rachel, Okay  well you are just gonna have too  okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together  okay  I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!! 
Ross, Okay  okay  okay.  I’ll get the bagels.
Monica,  What’s this?
Phoebe, Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Monica, This is not the bed I ordered!
Phoebe, I know  you must’ve won like a contest or something!
Monica, Phoebe!
Monica, Why is this car in my bedroom?
Phoebe, I’m sorry  okay  I-I wasn’t looking  and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...
Monica, When did I sign for it?
Phoebe, When I was you! Y'know what  it’s all Joey’s fault  ‘cause he left his nose open!
Monica, Did you make brownies today?
Chandler, Knock  knock.
Monica,  Quick  take off your dress  he won’t notice the bed.
Chandler, Hey  I’m going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa  somebody missed the off ramp.
Phoebe, It’s Monica’s bed. What?
Chandler, Okay.  It’s a racecar.
Phoebe, So. This has always been Monica’s bed  what you’re just noticing now  how self-involved are you?
Chandler, Okay  well it this bed isn’t new  how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Monica, Sometimes I have bad dreams. 
Joey, Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Joey, Whoa. That was really good.
Chandler, You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Joey, Well  I-I might’ve said supergay.
Chandler, You totally screwed him over.
Monica, Joey  you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Joey, Because  Monica  the guy’s so good  and I really  really want this part.
Phoebe, Well  if you really  really want it  then it’s okay.
Rachel,  Hi Daddy.
Ross, Dr. Green. How are you? 
Ross, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Ross,  Okay  that’s it  I can’t take it anymore.
Rachel, What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair  he just wants to know how you got here.
Ross, Oh  please. Sweetie it’s hopeless  okay  I’m just gonna go. 
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Look  look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
Rachel, He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
Ross, Thank you! That’s what I keep saying.
Rachel, Excuse me  Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Ross, Uh.
Rachel, Well that’s his last name.
Ross, And his first name.
Rachel, It’s Robert Bobby.
Rachel, And um  excuse me  he helps me.
Ross, Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
Rachel, With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.
Ross, Argue with that.
Rachel, What? It’s true  my right leg is two inches shorter.
Ross, I know that!
Rachel, I’m sorry  let her?
Ross, What can I do  she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
Rachel, No.
Ross, Hey  would you ah  would you like some juice?
Ross, Okay.  Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Rachel, Yeah honey  I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.
Ross, Excellent!
Joey,  There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent  present. And I’m ashamed to say that I took it  I advised a fellow actor to play a role  homosexually. Yeah  we both auditioned for the part  and uh  as it turned out  they ah  they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now  he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi  the first lady of daytime television  and me  me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people  most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I’m sorry  I’m sorry  I’m sorry.  Thank you.
Monica, Yeah  I talked to you on the phone  I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Joey, All right  Jester man  look we wanna see the king.
Joey, Oh-ho-kay  I’m talking to the king. 
Chandler, Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom!  Hey-hey good lookin’!  Varrrrrrrrroom.  All right  I’ll leave. My bed’s so boring.
Rachel, Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Chandler, I will have one. 
Chandler, Okay  I’m not gonna have one.
Ross, Neither will I. 
Phoebe, No  no  it’s just my tooth.
Chandler, All right I’ll have one. 
Ross, So what’s a matter  you need a dentist? I’ve got a good one.
Phoebe, No thanks  I have a good one too. I just  I  I can’t see him.
Chandler, See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross, Why? Why can’t you go to him?
Phoebe, Because  every time I go to the dentist  somebody dies.
Chandler, That is so weird  because every time I go to the dentist  I look down the hygienist’s blouse.
Rachel, Phoebe  what? Umm...what?!
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah  first there was my aunt Mary  and then there was umm  John  my mailman  and then my  my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
Rachel, And all these people actually died?
Phoebe, Yes  while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now  y'know  it’s not about oral hygiene  I floss to save lives!
Ross, Pheebs  come on  you didn’t kill anybody  these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It’s  it’s  it’s just ah  a coincidence.
Phoebe, Well tell that to them. Oh! You can’t  their dead.
Ross, Thanks  Gunther.   Hey!  Umm  can I get a napkin too?
Phoebe,  Ow! Ow! 
Rachel, Phoebe  your in pain  would you just go to the dentist  just go.
Phoebe, All right  fine  fine  but if you’re my next victim  don’t come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
Rachel, I promise.
Phoebe, Although  don’t feel like you can’t visit.
Joey,  Hey  is  is  is Chandler here?
Ross,  No  no he’s not.
Monica, You guys  Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Ross, What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how  how are you going to tell Chandler?
Joey, Well  I was thinking about that and I  I think the best way would be  to not.
Rachel, Joey  you can’t keep this to yourself  if you know about this  you have to tell him.
Joey, It’ll kill him. I mean it’ll  it’ll just kill him.
Phoebe, Well  you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist  maybe I’ll kill him.
Joey,  Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Phoebe, Well  I’m going to the dentist  so listen  okay  just be on the look out for anything that  that  that you can fall into  or  or that can fall on you  or... All right  just look out! Okay  And um  I also just wanna  I just wanna tell you all that um...... 
Ross, Okay  I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours  some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Joey, What did they do?
Ross, Well  they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing  then they rearranged the figures  let’s just leave it at that.
Monica, So  do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Ross, Yes  that’s what I was going to ask  thank you.
Rachel, Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Ross, You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That’d be great  no  I just wanted to ask Monica  because I know how empty her life is. 
Joey, Hey-hey  Ross?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, I’ve got a science question.
Ross, Hmm?
Joey, If the Homo Sapiens  were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’  is that why there extinct?
Ross, Joey  Homo Sapiens are people.
Joey, Hey-hey  I’m not judging.

Rachel, Okay  okay  okay.
Monica, I got it!
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, The second that Ross walks in that door  I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go   rweee!!
Rachel, Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Monica, A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Rachel, We need a hat..
Monica, Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Rachel, Oh  oh  oh  I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!! 
Monica, Because he’ll know what to do?  Oh my God  you’re a genius!
Rachel, Oh God  oh God  it’s sowed on though.
Monica, Give it. Give it.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Oh  it’s just like a bloodbath in here today.
Chandler, Hey! Hold on a minute  hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Joey, I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
Chandler, Janice’s birthday is coming up  I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
Joey, Whoa  whoa  whoa  wait  whoa. Do you ah  want to get her something speacial  get her flowers  get her candy  get her gum  girls love gum.
Chandler, That’s a good idea  ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.
Joey, Oh  you want something serious. Y'know what you should do  you should get her one of those um  barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Chandler, All right. Look  I’m gonna go in here  and you don’t buy me anything ever. 
Joey,  No  no  you can’t  you can’t  okay  you can’t  you can’t buy her pearls  you just can’t  you can’t  you can’t.
Chandler, Why not?!
Joey, Oh God. Uh  okay  here’s the thing  this is the thing  okay  the thing is...
Chandler, What is the thing?
Joey, Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and  and I saw Janice  kissing her ex-husband.
Chandler,  What?
Joey, They were in his office.
Chandler, Well she  she wouldn’t do that  she’s with  she’s with me.
Joey, I’m telling you man  I saw it.
Chandler, Yeah  well  you’re wrong! Okay  you’re wrong.
Joey, I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now  huh?
Monica, It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Rachel, Right.
Monica, Besides  it takes the focus off the hat.
Phoebe,  No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!
Rachel, See Pheebs  I promised you no one would die  didn’t I?
Phoebe, Yeah  well  we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.
Monica, Sure  we have no money  go ahead.
Phoebe,  ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay  see ya!’
Monica, Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Rachel, Okay  I heard that.
Monica, Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Monica, Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!
Monica, Oh-ho-ho  sweetie  sweetie  you gotta stop saying that  now. It’s no big deal  it’s not even worth mentioning  you see we all do it all the time. See watch this  Ben  Ben  Ben.  Ow  Monica bang!  Everybody bang.  Ben bang.  Rachel bang.  Bang  Rachel bang! Oh  isn’t that fun?
Rachel,  Look at that!  Look at that!  We all do it.  Okay  I’m stopping now.
Monica, You okay?
Rachel, Oh yeah! Y'know  if it’s not a headboard  it’s just not worth it.
Chandler, Ah  I don’t know  you tell me. Anything you ah  wanna tell me  because  if you ah  you should  if you  you would  tell me.
Chandler, You tell me! Maybe  it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no  no-no-no-no  that was you!!
Chandler, All right!
Chandler, Joey told me  he saw you two kissing.
Chandler, No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Chandler, Wh-wh-why  wh-why  why  why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Chandler,  Here.
Chandler, I’ll take it! All right look  I gotta know. Are you finished with me?  Are you finished with him?  Do you still love him?  Do you still love me?  All right look   I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay  so which is it  him or me? 
Phoebe,  Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!
Monica, Okay  Ben  I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner  if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.
Rachel, Monica  number one  I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery  and number two  I...   What?!
Joey, You said number two.
Rachel, I also said number one.
Joey, I know. 
Ross,  Hey! Everyone.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, How’s my little boy?
Rachel, He’s perfect  he’s never been better.
Ross,  What’d you do  take him whaling?
Ross, Oh my God  he just said your name  that’s great! Good job Ben.
Monica, Oh that’s right  that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.
Phoebe, Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know  and everyone is alive.
Joey, Uh.
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. 
Phoebe, Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too  to bring down something that big.
Rachel, Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
Joey, I’m tellin’ ya  he hasn’t moved since this morning.
Monica, All right  we should call somebody.
Ross, And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.
Rachel, Well  we have gotta find out if he’s alive.
Monica, How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.
Joey, Well  there is one way. His window’s open  I say  we poke him.
Joey, Hey! Y'know how we ah  save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Well  now we got a reason.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Well  we’re fashioning a very long poking device.
Chandler, All right.
Joey, Hey uh  what’s a matter?
Chandler, I talked to Janice.
Joey, Oh my God  is she going back to him?
Chandler, She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love  well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them  because she choked on the reciept!
Joey, What are you ah  what are you gonna do?
Chandler, I don’t know  y'know. What  what  would you do?
Joey, Well  it doesn’t matter what I would do.
Chandler, Come on  tell me.
Joey, All right  you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah  if it was me  and this is just me   I would ah  I would bow out.
Chandler, What?  What are you  what are you talking about?
Joey, They have a kid together  y'know. They’re like  they’re like a family  and if  I don’t know  there’s chance they could make that work  I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah  come poke a nude guy?
Ross, Well  he’s finally alseep. About that ah  bump on his head?
Rachel, Are you  are you  are you sure it’s ah  a new bump? I mean  no offense  I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
Ross, It’s okay if he bumps his head  kids bump their heads all the time  y'know  it was your first time babysitting  I figured you did the best you could.
Rachel,  I did!
Ross, I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rachel, I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Ross, Monica did it?
Ross, Monica?
Monica, Yeah.
Ross, Umm  did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Monica, No. Why?
Ross, Well  I was just playing with him  and y'know we were doing the alphabet song  which he used to be really good at  but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah  I don’t know  fell out of his head.
Monica, Really?!
Ross, Oh  and also  he’s  he’s walkin’ kind of funny  his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg  and he’s in there just sort of y'know... 
Monica, Oh my God  I wrecked your baby!! 
Rachel, I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.
Monica,  You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! 
Ross, Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!
Rachel, I’ll get the hat.
Chandler, Janice  I have something I need to tell you  and I want you to let me get through it  because it’s  it’s  it’s not gonna be easy.
Chandler, I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family  y'know when my parents split up  it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason  you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was  or how happy he made my Dad.
Chandler, Yeah  well. It’s the right thing to do.
Chandler, Then don’t leave me!
Chandler, Forget what I said  I was babbling! Pick me!
Chandler, No you don’t! No  no  no  I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
Chandler, Ohhh. Don’t go.
Chandler, No. No! No! No!
Chandler, I don’t care!  I don’t care!!
Chandler, You can’t leave! I have your shoe!
Joey, All right now remember  something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver  fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Ross, Can we please focus here  a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
Phoebe, I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Joey, All right  ladies and gentlemen  let’s poke.  Steady. Steady. Okay  a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay  okay  we’re approaching the window  Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
Phoebe, He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
Monica, And yet  we’re still poking him.
Joey, Okay  retract the device  retract the device.
Ross, He does not look happy.
Rachel, Hey-hey  now he’s showing us his poking device.
Joey, Hey  that’s never gonna make it all the way over here  buddy!
Chandler,  I’ll hold you close in my arms.  I can’t resist your charms. And love....
Phoebe,  Love....
Chandler,  No you know I don’t mind.
Chandler, I know.
Phoebe, I know.
Chandler, I’ve found.
Phoebe, I’ve found....
Phoebe, Hey  it’s your Thanksgiving too  y'know  instead of watching football  you could help.
Monica, Okay  Rachel  you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.
Rachel, No Mon  you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Monica, Every year.
Phoebe, Y'know  for once  I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .
Ross, Halftime.
Joey, Hey  who wants to ah  throw the ball around a little  maybe get a little three on three going?
Rachel, Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Phoebe, Oh  can I play too? I’ve never played football  like ever.
Joey, Great  you can cover Chandler.
Chandler, No  no  no  I don’t  I don’t really wanna play.
Joey, Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Chandler, That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!
Joey, Chandler  you have to start getting over her. All right  if you play  you get some fresh air  maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice  and if you don’t play  everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.
Chandler, Yeah  all right  I’ll play.
Phoebe, Yay!!
Rachel, Let’s do it! Ross?
Ross, What?
Rachel, Do you wanna play football?
Ross, Um  Monica and I aren’t supposed to play football.
Joey, Says who? Your mom?
Monica, Well  every  every Thanksgiving um  we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl.’
Chandler, No  no  no  you say that proudly.
Monica, Anyway  Ross and I were always captains  and um  it got kind’ve competitive and one year  Geller Bowl VI  I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.
Ross, It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her  so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Monica, To score the winning touchdown  by the way.
Ross, Whoa  whoa  whoa  ho  ho  ho  you did not win the game  the touchdown didn’t count  because of the spectacularly illegal  oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Monica,  I won the game.
Ross, Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
Rachel, Um  there was a Geller Cup?
Ross, Yes  it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said  ‘nobody won that game  ‘ and he was sick of our fighting  so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
Chandler, And was the curse lifted?
Ross, Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.
Monica, Y'know what  I think we should play a game. I mean come on  it’s been twelve years.
Ross, Can I see you for a second?
Monica,  Once!!
Ross, All right  we’re gonna play.
Chandler, But wait a minute though  how are we gonna get there  though  because my Mom won’t let me cross the street.
Monica, Okay. Let’s bring it in.
Rachel, Wait no  honey  honey throw it to me  throw it to me.
Ross, Here you go. 
Rachel,  That almost hit me in the face.
Joey, All right  we have to pick captains.
Chandler, And then Tineals.
Phoebe, Okay  so how do we decide that?
Monica, Well  why don’t we just bunny up.
Monica, Okay  looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay  so um  I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey, Thank you.
Rachel, Monica  I’m your best friend.
Ross, Sweetie  don’t worry you’ll get picked. Chandler.
Rachel, Ross!
Monica, Phoebe.
Ross, Sweetie  now I pick you.
Rachel, You don’t pick me! You’re stuck with me!
Ross, Okay. All right. So let’s see  let’s play from the trash can  to the lightpost. Right. Two hand touch  we’ll kick off.
Monica, All right people listen  I’ve got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again.

Ross, Okay  it’s second down.  Take all the second downs you need.
Monica, I heard that!
Ross, Well  I said it loud.
Chandler, Well  that went well.
Joey, I think so.
Chandler, Y'know  I was thinking about ah  asking her for her number.
Joey, Thanks man  but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself  y'know.
Chandler, Whoa-ho  whoa! No  I was thinking about y'know for me  as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Joey, Oh  yeah  that. All right  means that much to ya  I’ll let you have her.
Chandler, Thanks. What  let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?
Joey, Well I don’t like to say it out loud  but  yeah! Don’t feel bad man  we all have our strengths. You’re better with numbers and stuff.
Chandler, Math!! You’re giving me math! All right  look y'know what  forget about it  you go for the girl  we’ll see who gets her.
Ross, Chandler  I want you to run a post pattern to the left  okay. And sweetie..
Rachel, Yeah  I know  go long. Y'know  it’s like all I’m doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Ross, Well ah  you wanna just stay out there?
Rachel, Can I see that for second.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Okay. Hut! Hike!
Joey, Fumble!
Joey, What the hell’s the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
Chandler, Well now you have two. Hey  I am good at math.
Joey, All right  that’s it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now  forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself.
Chandler, Hey! Well  I’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that’s mean!

Rachel, Now  does it really matter?
Phoebe, Well  okay  I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Ross, Oh Pheebs  that’s great. It doesn’t count.
Monica, Does so count!
Ross, Cheater  cheater  compulsive eater.
Phoebe, Oh my God!

Ross, Oh-ho  okay.
Monica, Dead leg!! 
Ross, Ow! Ow! Okay  okay  fine  fine! All right  you wanna win by cheating  go ahead  all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count  you win.
Phoebe, Woo-yay!!
Monica, No! Listen  I’m not gonna go through this with you again  okay. Just once I wanna beat when you can’t blame it on the broken nose  the buzzer  or the fact that you thought you were getting mono. Let’s just call this  tie score and it’s halftime.
Ross, Okay  first of all  I don’t play with cheaters  and second of all  you know I had swollen glands!!
Monica, Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.
Ross, Oh really! Why is that?
Monica, Because the winner gets this!
Ross, The Geller Cup.
Chandler, Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
Chandler, Okay  good.
Ross, Okay  where in the hell did you get that?!
Monica, When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed  I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Ross, That cup is mine!
Monica, No it’s not! You want it  you’re gonna have to win it!
Rachel, All right  so are we not having dinner at all?
Monica, Come on Phoebe  let’s go! Come on  it’s time to get serious  huddle up. Joey  keep your head in the game.
Joey, It’s hard  y'know  his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.
Monica, All right look  if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Joey, What are you gonna do?
Monica, All right  you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball  I’ll take care of the rest.
Joey, Okay.
Monica, Break!
Joey, Here you go!
Ross, Chandler! Chandler!
Chandler,  Hi.
Monica, Whoa! Whoa!! Tackled by a girl! Bet ya don’t see that everyday  do ya?
Ross, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?
Monica, What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Ross, Okay  you wanna play rough  we can play rough.
Phoebe, I love this game!!
Ross, Hey  where’d you get that?
Rachel, I went really long.
Monica, Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey  Ross is done!
Ross, It’s no surprise that your winning  ‘cause you got to pick first  so you got the better team.
Monica, You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it  we’re winning because I’m better than you.
Monica, Oh  what a great argument  exhaling! All right  y'know what  I’ll prove it to you  okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel  and I’ll still win the game.
Ross, What?! The guys against the girls? See  that’s ridiculous Monica  because I’m only down by three touchdowns.
Monica, Oh  then bring it on! Oh  unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Ross, Fine  fine  Rachel your with Monica  Joey you’re with me.
Rachel, I can not believe your trading me!!
Monica, Come on Rach  come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.
Rachel, Are you gonna let me play?
Monica, All right then.
Chandler, No-no-no-no  the game’s not over  we’re just switching teams.
Joey, Yeah  Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.
Ross, Right. Okay  let’s play. Let’s go.
Chandler, No ah  hold on a second Joe  where do Dutch people come from?
Joey, Ah well  the ah  Pennsylvania Dutch  come from Pennsylvania.
Chandler, And the other ah  Dutch people  they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands  right?
Joey, Nice try.  See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Ross, Enough with geography for the insane  okay? Let’s play some ball  guys.
Joey, Whoa  whoa  no  no  I-I’m not playing with this guy  now.
Chandler, Fine with me.
Ross, Okay  y'know what  let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi  which of my boys do you like?
Ross, Yeah  y'know for dating  general merriment  taking back to your windmill...
Chandler, Yes!!
Joey, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.
Chandler, Well  you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.
Chandler, You hear that! That is her chose  mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! 
Chandler, Wh-what?
Joey, Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Chandler, Y'know what  it doesn’t matter  ‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready  Set  Cook!
Ross, Save the breakthroughs for therapy  okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time  and we are losing  we are losing to girls.
Chandler, We’re not gonna lose to girls.
Ross, Hey! It’s 42-21!
Joey, This sucks  I was just up by that much!
Monica, Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Monica, We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay  just think about every lousy date that you ever had  okay  every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...
Phoebe, Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Monica, Come on  okay  come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!
Rachel, Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!
Phoebe, All right  no  well I want to kill them to  but their boys  y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Monica, All right  we still have a minute and a half to go  and we’re down by two points. Two points....  Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel  you go long.
Rachel, No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Monica, Honey  there’s a reason.
Rachel, God  I’m not lame  okay. I can do something. I can throw  would you let me throw  come on this is my game too.
Phoebe, Come on Mon  let her throw the ball.
Monica, All right Rachel  you sweep behind  I’ll pitch it to you  you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.

Monica, Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
Rachel, I’m so sorry! Are you okay?

Chandler, Hey-hey-hey Rachel  funny thing. Actually  the ah  end zone starts at that pole  so you’re five feet short  so we win!
Phoebe, Wait-wait-wait-wait! So  explain something to me though  if  if nobody tagged Rachel  then isn’t the play still going.
Ross, Let go! Let go!
Monica, Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!
Chandler, Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving  it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is   the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you  Amsterdam! Good night!!
Monica, Ow!!
Rachel, We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.
Phoebe, Isn’t there a national football league.
Chandler, Yes. Yes  there is  they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Rachel, Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Phoebe, Umm  this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Joey, When they’re hungry enough  they’ll come in.
Monica, Let go!
Ross, No! You let go!
Monica, No!
Ross, How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
Monica, I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.
Ross, Hey! It’s starting to snow.
Ross, Gimme the this!
Monica, Let go!
Chandler,  Eh...  I don’t  I don’t know.
Rachel, What?
Chandler, Well  as old as he is in dog years  do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Oh  sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Rachel,  Eh  do you believe that?
Chandler,  Yeah?
Ross, Just admit it Chandler  you have no backhand.
Chandler, Excuse me little one  I have a very solid backhand.
Ross, Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Chandler, I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Ross, All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache. 
Monica, You broke a little girl’s leg?!!
Ross, I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Chandler,  Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Ross, Well  I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something  what do you think she’ll like?
Monica, Maybe a Hello Kitty doll  the ability to walk...
Rachel, I’m gonna get back to retraining. 
Ross, All right  see you guys. 
Chandler, Look out kids  he’s coming! 
Joey, And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe, Have fun. Oh wait  no  don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Joey, What? Me having a job?
Phoebe, No  no  I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime  and their  their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey  how do you sleep at night?
Joey, Well  I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey  Phoebe listen  you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees  their fulfilling their life purpose  by  by making people happy.
Phoebe, Really?
Chandler, Yes. Yes  and ah  ah  the trees are happy too  because for most of them  it’s the only chance to see New York.
Rachel, Gunther  Gunther  please  I’ve worked here for two and a half years  I know the empty trays go over there. 
Rachel, Huh. Well  y'know that’s actually a really good idea  because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what  you should have the other waitresses do that too.
Rachel, Gee  I always heard them talk about that  I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God  I’m  I’m sorry. 
Ross, So  this must be kinda neat for ya  huh? I mean  your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school  and you  you ah  don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.
Ross, Wow  you ah  you really like all this space stuff  huh?
Ross, I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Ross, Huh. Well  good luck to Dad. Say  how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Four hundred  huh? Well  that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?
Ross,  And what is second prize?
Ross, Well  that makes sense.
Ross, Yeah  Sarah  anything.
Ross, Hi  I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.
Ross, No  hi  I’m  I’m an honorary Brown Bird 
Ross, Ah  well  it means that I can sell cookies  but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
Ross, No  please  please  um  it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
Ross, Okay  okay! I’m going. I’m going. 
Ross, All right!!
Phoebe,  Hey.
Joey, Hey. What  what are you doing here?
Phoebe, Well  I-I thought a lot about what you said  and um  I realilized duh  all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah   oh  but oh...
Joey, Look now  Phoebe remember  hey  their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Phoebe, Destiny.
Joey, Sure.
Phoebe, Yes.
Joey, All right.
Phoebe, Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.
Joey, Oh  that’s  that’s ah  one of the old ones  he’s just taking it to the back.
Phoebe, You keep the old ones in the back  that is so ageist.
Joey, Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Phoebe, So  what happens to the old guys?
Joey, Well  they go into the chipper.
Phoebe, Why  do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!! 
Joey,  Hey! Hey!! 
Ross, ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters  Santa  Rudolph  and Baby Jesus.
Joey, All right  I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.
Ross, Wait a minute  one box! Come on  I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp  I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler  what about you?
Chandler, Ahh  do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Ross, No  but ah  there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what  I’ll put you down for eight boxes  one for each night.
Ross, Mon?
Monica, All right  I’ll take one box of the mint treasures  just one  and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember  how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ross, Ah  no Mon  Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah  y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time  why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.
Monica, No.
Ross, Oh  come on  now you know you want ‘em.
Monica, Don’t  don’t  don’t  don’t  don’t do this.
Ross, I’ll tell you what Mon  I’ll give you the first box for free.
Monica,  Oh God! I gotta go! 
Ross, Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! 
Rachel,  I’m training to be better at a job that I hate  my life officially sucks.
Joey, Look Rach  wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
Rachel, Well  yeah! I’m still pursuing that.
Chandler, How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what  two years ago?
Rachel, Well  I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.
Joey, If you ask me  as long as you got this job  you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
Rachel, The fear?
Chandler, He’s right  if you quit this job  you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Rachel, Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate  I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?
Chandler, Because  I’m too afraid.
Rachel, I don’t know  I mean I would give anything to work for a designer  y'know  or a buyer.... Oh  I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.
Chandler, Yeah  that’d be much worse than being 28  and still working here.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Can’t I just look at the handles on them?
Rachel, Okay  fine. Gunther  y'know what  I am a terrible waitress  do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because  I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf  I don’t care where the tray spot is  I just don’t care  this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.
Rachel, Gunther  I quit.
Chandler,  Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? 
Ross, ....and 12  22  18  four...  What?
Chandler, I spelled out boobies.
Monica,  Ross  but me down for another box of the mint treasures  okay. Where  where are the mint treasures?
Ross, Ah  we’re out. I sold them all.
Monica, What?
Ross, Monica  I’m cutting you off.
Monica, No. No  just  just  just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal  all right  I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Ross, Mon  look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
Monica,  Oh God! 
Chandler, So  how many have you sold so far?
Ross, Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
Chandler, Oh my God  how did you do that?
Ross, Okay  the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium  without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me  the key to my success  ‘the munchies.’ So I ah  started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
Rachel,  Okay  stop what you’re doing  I need envelope stuffers  I need stamp lickers.....
Ross, Well hey  who did these resumes for ya?
Chandler, Me! On my computer.
Ross, Well you sure used a large font.
Chandler, Eh  yeah  well ah  waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Rachel, Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Chandler, Something else I might have said?
Rachel, I don’t know  I don’t know  weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Ross, Sweetie  calm down  it’s gonna be okay.
Rachel, No  it’s not gonna be okay Ross  tomorrow is my last day  and I don’t have a lead. Okay  y'know what  I’m just gonna  I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him  I’m not quitting.
Chandler, You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.
Rachel, You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
Joey,  Hey! I got great news!
Chandler, Run  Joey! Run for your life! 
Joey, What? Rachel  listen  have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
Rachel, No.
Joey, Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So  you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
Rachel, Oh my God! Yes  I would love that  oh  that is soo sweet  Joey.
Joey, Not a problem.
Rachel, Thanks.
Joey, And now for the great news.
Ross, What  that wasn’t the great news?
Joey, Only if you think it’s better than this...  snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon  you want me to decorate the window  give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Monica, Christmas cookie?
Joey, Okay  and ah  this one here is a Douglas Fir  now it’s a little more money  but you get a nicer smell.
Phoebe,  Wait  wait  wait  wait  wait! No  no  you don’t want that one. No  you can have this cool brown one. 
Phoebe, Okay but that’s why you have to buy it  so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny  otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him  Joey
Joey, Yeah  the ah  trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
Joey, Pheebs  you gotta stop this  I working on commission here.
Monica,  Hey  guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Phoebe, Well look no further   this one’s yours! Ahhh.
Monica, Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Phoebe, All right y'know what  nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry  I’m sorry  I didn’t mean to get so emotional  I guess it’s just the holidays  it’s hard.
Monica, Oh honey  is that ‘cause your Mom died around Christmas?
Phoebe, Oh  I wasn’t even thinking about that.
Monica, Oh. 
Ross,  Hi there. How many  how many ah  did you sell?
Ross, Hey now! That was an accident  okay.
Ross, What’s a scrud?
Ross, I don’t have too. I can just look at you.
Ross,  Not nice enough.
Ross,  Good for a scrud.
Ross, That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird.  Good going. 
Ross, Hi there!
Ross, Um  that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
Chandler, Tell us what happened  Brown Bird Ross.
Ross, Well  I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister  who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz  and sold over 2 000 boxes.
Chandler,  Hey! How’d the interview go?
Rachel, Oh  I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.
Ross, Oh  come here sweetie  listen  you’re gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.  That’s not how that was supposed to come out.
Phoebe, This is the worst Christmas ever.
Chandler, Y'know what Rach  maybe you should just  y'know stay here at the coffee house.
Rachel, I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  Look at her  she’s even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
Ross, That word was swans.
Chandler, Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself  really perked up my Christmas.
Phoebe, Oh! Oh my God!
Phoebe, You saved them! You guys! Oh God  you’re the best!
Chandler, It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’
Rachel,  Hello?  Yeah  this is she.  Oh! You’re kidding! You’re kidding!  Oh thank you! I love you!
Chandler, Sure  everybody loves a kidder.
Rachel,  I got the job!
Phoebe, Oh  God bless us  everyone.
Rachel, Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee.  There you go.  Enjoy. 
Chandler,  Should I tell her I ordered tea?
Ross, No.
Rachel, Um  excuse me  everyone. Ah  this is my last night working here  and I ah  just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here  and ah  it’s just time to move on.  Ah  and no offence to everybody who ah  still works here  you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
Ross, I’m  I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp  and I’m hoping that maybe somehow  this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! 
Ross, Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
Joey,  Ten  ten..  nine  nine  nine....  eight  eight  eight...  Okay  Blast off!
Chandler, I’m an alien. I’m an alien.
Ross, Oh no! An asteroid! 
Joey, Okay  pick a card  any card.  All right  now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
Monica, Um-mm.
Joey, All right  give it back to me.  5 of hearts.
Ross, Real magic does exist.
Rachel, Wow.
Monica, Wow. Joey   how do you do it?
Joey, I can’t tell you that  no.
Ross, Ah  somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
Rachel, Noo  that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
Monica, He took up the carpet  and now you can hear everything.
Phoebe, Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly  please?’
Monica, I have like five times  but the guy is so charming  that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
Phoebe, Ooh  that is silly.  I’ll go up there  I’ll tell him to keep it down.
Monica, All right  be my guest.
Rachel, Good luck.
Joey, All right  all right  all right  all right  all right  you really wanna know how I did it  I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card  what you didn’t see was  I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.  I just did it.  I just did it  again. Here  I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. 
Phoebe,  Yeah  look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do  and I am sick and tired... .
Phoebe,  Oh  thank you.
Chandler,  Hey  anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Monica, Honey  what’s the matter?
Chandler, I just saw Janice.
Chandler, Yeah  she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband  she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.
Joey, Man  I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine  after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna  just laughing and talking. God  it killed me.
Chandler, Yes  but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Joey, Sorry  I just  any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Ross, Hey Chandler  there’s a party tomorrow  you’ll feel better then.
Chandler, Oh  y'know what  I’m gonna be okay  you don’t have to throw a party for me.
Monica, It’s Joey’s birthday.
Chandler, Oh  well then  if anybody should have a party it should be him.
Monica, Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Chandler, Okay  well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know  it’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
Rachel,  Yeah  right away Mr. Kaplan.
Rachel, I know!
Rachel, Op.
Rachel, Oh  you got me.
Rachel, Oh  that sounds great.
Rachel, Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan  thank you so much.
Rachel, Oh God  I hate my job  I hate it  I hate my job  I hate it.
Monica, I know honey  I’m sorry.
Rachel, Oh  I wanna quit  but then I think I should stick it out  then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job  just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.
Monica,  Gee  I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup  a James Beans  and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Rachel, Oh honey  come on  I’m sorry  I didn’t.... I don’t mind paying my dues  y'know  its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira  the arthritic seamstress  to the bathroom.
Rachel,  Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Rachel, It’s not funny  this is actually my job.
Rachel, Oh well then  so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Rachel, Yes?!
Rachel,   Do you want my pickle?
Monica, Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Phoebe, Well  he’s very charming.
Monica, I know  he’s too charming  but if you two start going out  then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Phoebe, Well  you’re just gonna have to try.
Monica, Joey  where are the Jell-o shots?
Joey, I don’t know  Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...
Joey, Chandler!
Chandler, Hello-dillillio!!
Ross, Oh  somebody’s feeling better.
Monica,  Stick out your tongue.
Chandler,  Take off your shirt!
Monica, Oh my!!
Joey, Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Chandler, Yeah  Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Rachel,  The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me  and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Ross, Wow!
Rachel, I know!
Ross, What  so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Rachel, Uh-huh!
Ross, And he’s  he’s a total stranger?
Rachel, Yeah! His name is um  Mark something.
Ross, Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Rachel, What!?
Ross, Well  I’m just saying  I mean why else would he just  y'know  swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Rachel, To be nice.
Ross, Hey  Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Joey, No  only for sex.
Ross, Thank you.  So did you ah  did you tell Mark Something about me?
Rachel, I didn’t have to  because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Ross, Uh-huh.
Joey, Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler,  Okay  how many of that girl are you seeing?
Monica, How hammered are you? Huh? These  these are Joey’s sisters.
Chandler, Hi Joey’s sisters!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Phoebe, Well  I have ah  vodka and cranberry juice.
Phoebe, Wow. Okay  I don’t know how to talk to you.
Chandler, Oh  I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Chandler, No-no-no-no  no  it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.
Ross, Hi.
Monica, Hi.
Ross, Yeah. So um  I-I heard about this ah  Mark guy that ah  Rachel met today.
Monica, Isn’t that great?
Ross, Oh yeah! So ah  kinda pretty  pretty good. He sounds like a nice  good guy.
Monica, Oh  he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean  y'know what  when he left I actually used the phrase  ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ 
Ross, That’s excellent.
Ross,  So  he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?
Rachel, Well  I assume I’ll have to take showers with him  but y'know  that’s true of any job.
Monica, How ya feelin’?
Chandler, Well  my apartment isn’t there anymore  because I drank it.
Phoebe, Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Yeah  I ended up in the storage room  and not alone.
Chandler, Ow  no ‘woo-hooing ’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
Phoebe, Why  what happened?
Chandler, Ah  I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well  that’s not the worst part.
Monica, What is the worse part?
Chandler, I can’t remember which sister.
Ross,  You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!
Monica, Are you insane? I mean Joey  is going to kill you  he’s actually going to kill you dead.
Chandler, Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
Phoebe, How can you not know which one?
Rachel, I mean that’s unbelievable.
Monica, I mean  was it Gina?
Ross, Which one is Gina?
Rachel, Dark  big hair  with the airplane earrings.
Monica, No  no  no  that’s Dina.
Chandler,  You see you can’t tell which one is which either  dwha!!
Phoebe, We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
Chandler, Veronica. Look  it’s got to be Veronica  the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
Monica, That was me.
Chandler, Look  when I’ve been drinking  sometimes I tend to get overly friendly  and I’m sorry.
Monica, That’s okay.
Rachel, That’s all right.
Ross, That’s okay.
Joey,  Can I talk to you for a second?!
Ross, Hey  Joey.
Rachel, Hey. 
Joey, Come on!! 
Chandler, Why can’t we talk in here? With  with  witnesses.
Joey, I just got off the phone with my sister.
Ross, Ah  which  which one?
Joey, Mary-Angela.
Ross, Mary-Angela.
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, Y'know which one was she again?
Joey, Why don’t you ask Chandler  ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.
Chandler, It’s gotta be the first one.
Joey, Really? That’s great! You and my sister  sittin’ in a tree.
Chandler, Yep  I’m in a tree.
Rachel, Did he call? Did Mark call?
Monica, No honey  I’m sorry  but the weekend’s not over yet.
Rachel, Oh.  Oh my God  is that Phoebe?
Monica, I guess they’re back from their date.
Rachel, Music. Very nice.
Monica, Oh my God!
Rachel, So  how are you?
Monica, I am good. I finished my book.
Rachel, Oh yeah  what’s it about?
Monica, I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Rachel, Yeah  I do. 
Ross, Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write.  What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Chandler, Well  that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
Ross, All right  look  look  you’ve got to do this yourself  okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela  okay  when which ever one she is comes to the door  you take her for a walk  you let her down easy.
Chandler, What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross, Where in Cuba?
Chandler,  Joey  what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Joey, Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Chandler, I’m here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey, You are so the man!  Now look  listen  listen  you got to be cool  ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet  and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Chandler, Where’s Mary-Angela?
Joey, She’s right in there. 
Rachel, I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night  and he didn’t call.
Ross, Bummer.
Rachel,  Yeah  right. Look at you  you’re practically giddy.
Ross, No  I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look  Rach  I want only good things for you.
Monica, Wait a minute  why don’t you just call Mark.  I mean  who says you have to sit here and wait for him  you’ve got to make stuff happen.
Ross, But  you  you don’t want to seem too pushy.
Monica,  Honey  it’s not pushy  he gave her his home number.
Ross,  What  he gave you his home number? As in like  to  to his home?
Rachel, Yeah  and you don’t mind if I call  because you only want good things for me.
Ross, That’s right good things  that-that is what I said. 
Rachel,  Hello  Mark? Hi  it’s Rachel Green.  Oh no  don’t you apologize.  Yeah  I’ll hold.  He left my number at work  but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
Ross, That is so made up!
Rachel,  Yeah  oh my God  tomorrow! That  no  it’s perfect. Oh God  thank you soo much. Great! Bye!  I got the interview!
Monica, Yay!
Ross, There you go.
Rachel, He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
Monica, Oh  that is amazing!
Ross, Yeah well  if I know Mark  and I think I do  I’d expect nothing less.
Rachel, I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.
Ross, High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
Rachel, Yeah! Right! Okay  I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!
Ross, You go get ‘em.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
Monica, What?
Ross, ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well  thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her  y'know prep her  as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Monica, Are you crazy?!
Ross, Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
Monica, What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right  what if he wants to sleep with her  does it mean he gets too?
Ross, No.
Monica, I mean don’t you trust her?
Ross, Well  yeah!
Monica, Then get over yourself! Grow up!
Ross,  You grow up.
Chandler, This teramisu is  is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Chandler, Well  it’s  it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Chandler, So um  Mary-Angela  what’s your second favorite?
Chandler, Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.
Chandler, So will I.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.
Chandler, Will you excuse me I have to um..... 
Chandler,  Hey!
Chandler, Look  I may have jumped the gun here.  Um  I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a  in a commitment kind of place.
Chandler, Ahhhh  you’re not Mary-Angela.
Chandler, This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela  then-then who is?
Chandler, Oh  this is soo bad. 
Chandler, No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!
Joey, What’s goin’ on?
Chandler,  You’re it! Now run and hide!
Joey, What?! How could you do that  how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
Chandler, I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look  I’m sorry okay  I was really drunk  and you all look really similar.
Chandler, Y'know what  we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me.  Are ya?
Joey, Well  that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Chandler, Joey if you wanna punch me  go ahead  I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family  you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
Joey, No! No! No! No  I’m not going to punch Chandler.
Joey, No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him  he’s sorry. But   you’ve got one more apology to make  all right  you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Chandler, Okay  absolutely!
Joey, All right.
Chandler, You’ve got it. 
Joey, Cookie  now you can punch him!
Chandler, What?! 
Rachel,  Hey!
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, What are you doing here?
Ross, Ah y'know  this building is on my paper route so I... 
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Hi. 
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, How’d did it go?
Rachel, Oh well  the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough  but y'know thank God Mark coached me  because once I started talking about the fall line  she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.
Ross, I’m so proud of you.
Rachel, Me too!
Ross, Listen  I’m ah  I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and  it’s just that I like you a lot  so...
Rachel, I know.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Yeah.  Hi Mark!
Rachel, Oh  I did!
Rachel,  Oh my God!! 
Ross, Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
Monica, So ah  Phoebe  how was your date?
Phoebe, Oh well y'know. 
Monica, Yeah  I do know.
Phoebe, Ick  you were eavesdropping.
Rachel, Eavesdropping. Pheebs  the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Phoebe, Oh  I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Ross, Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Ross, Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Joey, All right  that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But  is he a big guy?
Ross, Ah  we’ll all go.  Come on. 
Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Chandler, Don’t worry.
Phoebe, God  I hope they kick his ass!
Rachel, Honey  I’m sorry.
Monica, Y'know if it’s any consolation  he really did sound like he was having more fun with you. 
Rachel,  Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
Chandler, Oh yeah  but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Rachel,  Tell him.
Ross,  It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Chandler, All right  I suppose I can wait a day. Hey  what are you doing Friday?
Ross, Why?
Chandler, I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert  y'know he's the botanist.
Ross, Oh God. Y'know  botanists are such geeks.
Chandler, Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
Ross, Hmm? Oh  yeah. 
Phoebe,  Morning. Rach  I'm here with the purses!
Chandler,  It must take you forever to find your keys.
Rachel,  Thank you  thank you  thank you  Pheebs.
Phoebe, Your welcome  oh please not the one with the turtles.
Rachel, No  no  no  no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
Ross, Honey  just relax  it's gonna be fine. Hey  umm . why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Rachel, Oh honey  thank you  but Mark's taking me out.
Ross, Mark is that ah  the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Rachel, Yeah  it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing.  Is this actually a lunchbox?
Phoebe, Umm  no  it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Rachel, Oh.
Chandler,  Hey  so can you make it on Friday?
Ross, What? Oh yeah  yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Chandler, Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
Phoebe, A stripper at a bachelor party  that is so clich�. Why don't you get a magician?!
Chandler, Well  if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks  then all right.
Ross, She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And  and  and   he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do?
Chandler, Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud.
Joey,  Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Chandler, I want to say you but  that seems like such an easy answer.
Joey, It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York  New York  and ah  oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
Ross, Ah Joey  I don't think you get to pick the cities.
Joey, What?
Ross, Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Joey, Who?
Chandler, I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Joey, The what?
Chandler, The abridgment.
Joey, Oh  okay.  The what?
Rachel, Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Rachel, Oh!! I love this job!  Wow! My first call.
Ross,  Hi  is Rachel there?
Ross, This is Ross?
Ross, Of Ross and Rachel.
Ross, Oh hey  hey Mark.
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, Hi honey!
Ross, Hi! What's ah  what's Mark doing answering your phone?
Rachel, Oh  he's just goofing around.
Ross, Ohhhhh yeah  that's  that's funny. Why ah  why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
Rachel, Oh honey  this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
Ross, Why does Joanna need two assistants  how  how lazy is she?
Rachel, Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
Ross, What?
Rachel, I think I just shipped 3 000 bras to personnel. Oh honey  I gotta go.  Mark  I need you!
Ross, Okay  bye-bye. 
Rachel, Ow! Ross!!
Ross, Oh  oh  I'm  I'm  I'm sorry sweetie  I was just trying to ah  I'm dialing another number. 
Monica, Please  I'm not going for anything.
Monica, Would you please go?
Monica, Look Julio  someone left their book here.
Monica, Oh yeah  what are you reading?
Monica, Have I read it?  No  are you enjoying it?
Monica, Your a poet and don't know it. 
Monica, Oh  then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
Monica, Mine?  Right here?
Monica, How would that go?  Well  it didn't rhyme  but I liked it.
Joey,  You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss   you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
Joey, Really? Thanks.
Joey, Excellent  I'll be there.
Joey, Ahhh! My ah  my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
Chandler, ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Joey, Hey  everybody lies on their resume  okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Phoebe, Well  can you dance at all?
Joey, Yeah  I can dance  y'know. 
Chandler, Oh no  no  no  no.
Phoebe,  What  what is that?
Joey, Sure  it looks stupid now  there's no music playing.
Chandler, All right  I have to get that  but no-no.  Hello?   Hi! Yeah listen  I'm  I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that.  Let me ask you this  what  what do you do for the extra hundred?  So would I  would I have to provide the grapes?
Monica,  Hi!
Phoebe, Oh  how was last night with Julio  senorita?
Monica, It was soo amazing  he is so sexy  and smart  which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh  I gotta so you this. Last night  we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
Joey, Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
Chandler, Okay  we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
Joey, Well sure  you name a kid that  what do you expect them to grow up to be?
Monica, Anyway um  when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now  I am like totally dense about poetry  but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out. 
Joey,  The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
Chandler, To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey  y'know what that's pretty good.
Monica, Oh good  I think so too. Pheebs?
Phoebe, Oh yeah.
Monica, Oh  I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work. 
Joey, Whoa  I'm not done.
Monica, All right  just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
Chandler, Bye-bye.
Phoebe, Oh my God  oh my God! Poor Monica!
Chandler, What  what  what?!
Phoebe, What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look   'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you  you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty  she is the empty vase!
Chandler, You really think that is what he meant?
Phoebe, Oh  totally. Oh  God  oh  she seemed so happy too.
Joey, Done.
Rachel, Oh  yeah  sure  it's umm... 
Ross, It's from Ross  it's a love bug.
Rachel, Oh no  no-no-no  that's not  not  not  what he is doing. He's just  he's just really romantic.
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt  that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!
Rachel, All right Ross!! I get it!!
Ross, I mean my God...
Rachel, You're hurt!
Ross, ...can't  can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
Rachel, Oh  please  Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
Ross, I would never do that!
Rachel, Look  I know what's going on here  okay  Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Ross, Yeah well if  if  if Mark said that  than Mark's an idiot.
Joey, Mark's a genius!
Ross, Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Chandler, Look  don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away  he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
Ross, What am I going to do?
Chandler, Well  why don't you send her a musical bug  op  no you already did that. All right look  you're going to have to go there yourself now  okay  make a few surprise visits.
Ross, I don't know you guys.
Chandler, All right fine  don't do anything  just sit here and talk to us  meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive  and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me  because he understands me.'
Joey, And before you know it  she's with him. And you'll be all  'Ohh  man!' And he'll be all  'Yes!' And us  we'll be like  'Wh-whoa  dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like   'Hhiii ' and  and  and  'I can't go  Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like  'Man get over it  it's been four years!!'
Chandler, He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Rachel, Ohhh! That is soo sweet! 
Ross, All right that's  that's it!! Get off her!
Ross, What's going on?!  That's what's going on!!
Rachel,  Ross!
Ross, I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?!  Hi Rach. 
Joey, So  does that mean the audition is off?
Joey, What?!
Joey, It's ah  step-ity  step and jazz hands.
Joey, Bye. 
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey.
Phoebe, What are you wrapping?
Monica, Oh-ho  look what I got Julio.
Phoebe, Yeah  it's a vase.
Monica, Yeah  just like the one in the poem.
Phoebe, Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Monica, What do you mean?
Phoebe, Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh. 
Monica,  So! I'm just an empty vase  huh?
Monica, Y'know  so I don't read as many important books as you do  and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what  I get excited about stupid stuff  like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday  and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty  I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
Monica, You don't even know me...
Monica, What?
Monica, I'm sorry  my friend Phoebe...
Monica,  Oh yeah.
Joey, I know  it was the best I could get out of them.
Joey, People  people  people.
Rachel, So ah  did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Chandler, Oh yeah  yeah! Look what I got  look what I got.  See  she's fully dressed  right?
Rachel, Right.
Chandler, And then you click it and  uh-oh  she's naked. And then  and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman  she's walking down the street  she's window shopping  and  whoa-whoa-whoa  sh-she's naked! 
Ross,  Hi.
Rachel, Hello.
Chandler, Y'know what  I'm  I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Ross,  I'm sorry  I was an idiot.
Rachel, A big idiot.
Ross, A big idiot. Just you have to realize is  this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Rachel, Honey  why is it hard  I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
Ross, Well  I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So  it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna  well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Rachel, Honey  that's very sweet  it just seems to me though  that if two people love each other and trust each other  like we do  there's no reason to be jealous. 
Ross, I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Chandler, Oh  okay Ross. Listen  this pen is kinda getting boring  so can you pick me up some porn?
Rachel, Where ya going?
Ross, Oh  I've got to go pick up Ben  we've got a play date this afternoon.
Rachel, Ohh  with who?
Ross, Oh  just this woman that I met last night at the party.
Rachel, There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, You have a play date with a stripper?!
Chandler, Man  I gotta get a kid. 
Ross, Ah  yeah  yeah. Umm  we started talking after she y'know  did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age  so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why  is that okay?
Rachel, Sure  is she married?
Ross, Ahh  no.
Rachel, Oh. 
Ross, Are you jealous?
Rachel, Noo  I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you  that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
Ross, You are totally jealous.
Rachel, I'm not jealous. All right this is about  umm  people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know  and um  I...
Ross, Honey  I love you too.
Rachel, Ugh. Wait  wait  wait.
Ross, What?
Ross, Huh.
Rachel,  Well  there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours  y'know.
Chandler, Yeah. Either that  or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Monica,  Hi.
Monica, Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.
Monica, Y'know in a weird way  you have too much power. Look  you’re gonna have to help me out here  ‘cause I only have three.
Monica, Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!
Monica, Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey  thanks.
Monica, Right.
Monica, What?
Monica,  That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer  and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.
Monica, It’s good to see you too.
Monica, You see that guy? He’s in classics now  but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.
Monica, Yeah.
Monica, Me too.
Monica, Oh  um  I don’t know if that’s a good idea.
Monica, No  I just I think that it’s too soon.
Chandler, Yeah  baby!
Ross, What are you doing?
Chandler, Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
Ross, No thanks. I’m 29.
Rachel,  Oh my God  I gotta go to work!
Ross, Oh sweetie  when do you think you’re going to get off tonight?
Rachel, Oh I don’t know honey. It’s gonna be really late.
Ross, Oh come on  not again.
Rachel, I know. I’m sorry. Look  I’ll make a deal with you all right? Okay?
Ross, Hmm.
Rachel, For every night that you’re asleep before I get home from work...
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, I will wake you up in a way that’s proved very popular in the past.
Ross, Now  if you need to stay late  I want to be supportive of that.
Rachel, Right.
Phoebe,  Hi.
Joey,  Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
Phoebe, Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know  jogs  and blades  and swims  and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Ross, And what are you going to do for him?
Phoebe, I’m going to let him.
Ross, Okay.
Joey, Cool.
Monica,  Morning.
Rachel, Somebody got in late last night.
Monica, Yeah well  I ran into Richard.
Rachel, When did this happen?
Monica, Oh  um  around 8:02. We ah  talked for a little while  and then um  we went out for an innocent burger.
Phoebe, Oh  there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.
Ross, So  are you gonna see him again?
Monica, Tomorrow night.
Rachel, Monica  what are you doing?
Chandler, Well  she spent the last six months getting over him  and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Monica, It’s not a date  okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Joey, Well  you might wanna make a little extra  y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.
Monica, We’re not gonna have sex! Okay  nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do  so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.
Ross, Naked friends.
Rachel,  Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Rachel, Do you have any ice?
Joey, Check the freezer. If there’s none in there  then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.
Rachel, Yeah  I know. I had the greatest day though  I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie  she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?
Joey, I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Rachel, Hmm.  Umm  why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
Joey, Oh  I was reading it last night  and I got scared  so.
Rachel, But ah  you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?
Joey, Well  safer. Y'know  I mean I never start reading The Shining  without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer  y'know.
Rachel, How often do you read it?
Joey, Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel, Well  umm  I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic  what’s so great about The Shining?
Joey, The question should be Rach  what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.
Rachel, Okay. Ah  well we’ll just see about that  okay. I will read The Shining   and you will read Little Women.
Joey, All right  you got it.
Rachel, All right.
Joey, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, Ah  now Rach  these ah  these little women.
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, How little are they? I mean  are they like scary little?
Phoebe, Um  Chandler  Ross  this is Robert.
Chandler, Oh  hey.
Ross, Hey.
Phoebe,  You’ve have lipstick right here . That’s okay  it’s mine  we just kissed.
Ross, Oh.
Chandler,  So ah  isn’t a bit cold out for shorts?
Chandler, Right  right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Chandler,  I’m up! I’m up  I’ve gotten up now! Anybody ah  want anything?
Phoebe, I’ll have coffee.
Ross, Yeah  make that three.
Chandler, Okay Ross  why don’t you come with me?
Ross, Okay.   What ah  what is the matter with you? What’s going on?
Chandler, Robert’s coming out.
Ross, What  what do you mean  what? Is he gay?
Chandler, No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
Ross, What?!
Chandler, The man is showing brain.
Ross, Are you sure?  Hold on.  I’m sorry you guys  that was a coffee and a....
Ross, Okay.
Ross, No  no  that won’t be ah  that won’t be necessary 
Chandler,  Wellll?
Ross, Yeah  yeah  yeah!
Chandler, What do we do? What do we do?
Ross, Well  I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Chandler, Like an eclipse.
Monica, You say ‘Thank you very much ’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on  we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl  and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Monica, You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Monica, Oops.
Monica, Gotta keep squishing.
Monica, Okay.
Monica, Oh  gosh  you got some on your shirt.
Monica, Hold on a second  just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm  be.....
Monica, Umm  you’ve got some on your pants.
Joey, These little women. Wow!
Chandler, Your liking it  huh?
Joey, Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.
Ross, Umm  Jo’s a girl  it’s short for Josephine.
Joey, But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
Chandler, No  actually Laurie’s a boy.
Joey, No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, Hey! How’d the ah  basketball go?
Phoebe, Oh  okay  I learned how to shoot a lay-up  a foul shot  and a twenty-three pointer.
Chandler, You mean a three pointer?
Phoebe, Oh  I get more because I’m dainty.
Phoebe, Yeah  in the back. You want a quarter?
Joey,  What are you doing?  Get back over on your side of the...  Hello!!  Hi  I’m Joey  we haven’t met.
Phoebe, What?  What? You guys  what is going on? You not like Robert?  Why are you laughing?!
Ross, Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.
Phoebe, You guys!! Come on!
Chandler, I’m sorry  I’m sorry  it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area  as ah  one may have hoped.
Phoebe, What do you mean?
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, Hey Robert  could you ah  ha  pass me those cookies?
Monica, So  how’d the lasagne go over?  Really?! Good. So you owe me three pretty things.  Yeah  I’ve been thinking a lot about you too.  I know. It’s hard this whole platonic thing.  It’s a word!
Monica, Yeah  I do think it’s better this way.  Yeah  we’re being smart.   Yes  I’m sure.
Monica, I’ll call you back. 
Monica, So we can be friends who sleep together.
Monica, Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um  just out of curiosity  um  do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
Monica, Oh.
Monica, No!  No!
Monica, ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me  and we’re just friends.
Phoebe, Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!
Phoebe, Yeah. And  first here’s a gift.
Chandler, Stretchy pants! Why  those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day  every day!
Phoebe, That’s all right  that’s well  I figured.... 
Joey, Hey!  How’s it going?
Ross, Good.
Joey, Hey  Rach  how you doing with The Shining?
Rachel, Oh  Danny just went into room 217.
Joey, Oooh  the next part’s the best  when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Rachel, Oh  no  meh-nah-nah-nah  come on you’re gonna ruin it!
Joey, All right I’ll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Chandler, Hmmm  that’s very cool.
Joey, Oh  all blank  and no blank  make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no  no  the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank  but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Rachel, Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!
Chandler, I can’t believe she cracked your code!
Rachel, All right  okay  Laurie proposes to Jo  and she says no  even though she’s still in love with him  and then he ends up marring Amy.
Joey, Hey! Mine was by accident! All right  the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel  and kills the dad.
Rachel, Eh. Beth dies.
Joey, Beth  Beth dies?
Rachel, Um-hmm.
Joey, Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Chandler, No  Beth doesn’t die  she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?
Rachel, No. She doesn’t die.
Joey, Then why would you say that?!
Rachel, Because  I wanted to hurt you.
Rachel,  Oh my....
Monica, Hi.
Rachel,  Sorry. I’m sorry.
Monica, You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts  and then to top it off  I lost one of my fake boobs   in a grill fire.
Monica, What are you smiling at?
Rachel, I’m sorry  I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.
Monica, Yeah  right.
Monica, I love this friend thing!
Phoebe, Listen  Robert’s gonna be here any second so  will one of you just tell him?
Ross, Oh.
Phoebe, Please  right now  no  every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’
Chandler, We can’t tell him  you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Ross, He’s right  even if it’s to say something complementary. 
Phoebe, Hey.
Phoebe, No  I can spot you from here.
Phoebe, Okay  listen Robert...
Ross,  Hey  don’t we have to...
Chandler, Yeah  we got  um-hmm.
Phoebe, Umm  I think you’re really  really great...
Phoebe, I-I-I-I-I don’t know  I don’t know what to say.
Monica, Ow!
Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God! 
Monica,  So um  who was she?
Monica,  Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend  because I am totally fine with this.
Monica,  Okay  y'know what  I’m not fine  I’m not. I mean how can I be fine  hearing you come in with her  she wants to see your bedroom....  Y'know what  what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?
Monica, Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or  maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends  and vowed to be friends forever.
Monica, That’s not true  you don’t have a moustache.
Monica, Y'know what  I’ve got to walk out of here right now  ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.
Monica, How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?
Monica, Watch the thorns!
Rachel, What?
Joey, Beth is really  really sick.
Rachel, Awwww.
Joey, Jo’s there  but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.
Rachel, Joey?
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel, Do you want to put the book in the freezer?
Joey,  Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, Wow! This girl is good.
Phoebe, Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo  I never thought of that before.
Chandler, I like her.
Phoebe,  Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Chandler, Well  that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
Monica,  Look at you. All jealous.
Ross, Yeah Pheebs  come on  you two have completely different styles. Y'know  she’s more.. y'know  and you’re more 
Phoebe, Okay  see  see  everyone else is happy she’s done.
Phoebe, Oh no  one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
Phoebe, Hey Leslie  how’d you know I’d be here?
Chandler,  All right listen  I have to go to the bathroom  but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.
Joey,  So ah  Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Phoebe, Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Joey,  Ah  anything we might of heard of?
Phoebe, Hmm  bummer.
Phoebe, No. But thanks.
Phoebe, Okay. No. But thanks.
Joey,  Wow  that was kinda brutal.
Phoebe, Well okay  let this be a lesson to all of you  all right. Once you  once you betray me  I become like the ice woman  y’know. Very cold  hard  unyielding  y'know nothing  nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.  Can I have a tissue  please?
Monica, Yeah  sure.
Chandler, No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
Chandler, Jeez  man did you fall.. Hi! So ah  did ya  did-did-did ya fall high?
Chandler,  Y'know what Gunther  go ah  go ahead  I’m-I’m talking to ah  .  This is the part where you say your name.
Chandler, Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger  so....
Chandler, Nope  nope  I’d just ah  I’d rather talk to you.  Yes  I do. Yes  I do have to go to the bathroom. 
Phoebe, Where’s Chandler?
Joey, Ah  he can’t make it  he said he had to his...  Whoa-oh! 
Joey, Phew  close one.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi  sweetie!
Ross, Hello.
Ross, Yeah  huh.
Rachel, I’ve got some bad news.
Ross, What?
Rachel, I can get a quick bite to eat  but then I have to come back up here.
Ross, Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks  what is it this time?
Ross,  But work comes first!  Oh hey  but that’s sad about you though  what happened? Burn out? Burn all out  did ya?
Rachel, Nooo  he’s leaving for a better job.
Ross, Oh well that’s great  so I guess this is ah  this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
Rachel, Yeah  you bet.
Phoebe, Oh. 
Monica, Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Phoebe, Yeah  that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!
Monica, Wow  she must have hurt you pretty bad  huh?
Phoebe, Well  yeah. Y'know  we were best friends  ever since we were little  our Moms worked on the barge together.
Monica, Oh  you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
Phoebe, You never run on a barge!
Joey,  Hey.
Joey, Is ah  is Chandler around?
Monica, No  umm  he met some girl at the coffee house.
Joey, Oooh.
Monica, Yeah  Ginger something.
Joey, Nooo. No  no  ah  are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger  like ah  Gingeer?
Monica, No  it was Ginger. I remember  because when he told me  I said   ‘the movie star.’
Joey, Aww  man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate  she’s gonna tell him what I did.
Monica, Well  what did you do?
Joey, What  oh  oh  oh  no  no  I can’t  I can’t tell you that  it’s like the most awful  horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.
Monica, Y'know what  don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home   because it’ll be more fun that way.
Joey, All right!! Okay  it was like four years ago. Okay  Ginger and I had gone out a few times  and then this one weekend  we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me  her  and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night  I cooked this really romantic dinner....
Monica, You gave her food poisoning!?
Joey, I wish. No. After dinner  me  her  and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So  I picked up a log and threw it on. Or  at least what I thought was a log.
Phoebe, Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Joey, I wish. See  I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah  artificial leg.
Monica, Oh my God! Joey  what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Joey, I ran!!
Chandler, Well  that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.
Chandler,  Op  foot in a puddle  foot all in a puddle.
Chandler, Yeah  we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Chandler, No  really you’re gonna freeze.
Chandler, You’re not  what do you  what do you got a bionic foot?
Rachel, Funny book?
Ross, Hmmm. Oh  no  no  I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm  Mark  Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’
Rachel, Yeah  at the lecture  I told you that last week  you said you didn’t mind.
Ross, Oh  no  no  no  it’s-it’s not the lecture ah  I mind  umm....
Rachel, Oh  please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.
Ross, Oh  well...
Rachel, Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Ross, Well  I’m sorry  but ah  look if you’re not working with him anymore  why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Rachel, Because  he’s my friend.
Ross, Okay  but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Rachel, Okay  well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler  can I play with Mark?
Ross, Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Rachel, I don’t know  you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey  Mark is in fashion okay  I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.
Ross, Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Rachel, Really!?
Ross, Yeah  hey I-I have clothes  I even pick them out. I mean for  for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Rachel, Okay. Honey  I would love for you to go with me.  What?
Ross, What should I wear  now I’m all nervous.
Monica, Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe, It’s just y'know  been a couple of hours  and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care  y'know.
Monica, Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.
Phoebe, You think you know me so well.
Monica, Well  don’t ‘cha wanna?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, Okay  well I do know you.
Phoebe, That’s what I said.
Monica, Well so?
Phoebe, I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me  I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay  bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is  when we were playing together  that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
Phoebe,  I stepped in something icky.
Ross,  I’m really glad we came.  You’re so pretty. I love you.
Rachel, Oh. 
Phoebe,  Smelly cat  smelly cat  what are they feeding you? Smelly cat  smelly cat  it’s not your fault.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah!
Phoebe, I...  a jingle? No  no-no-no  no.
Phoebe, Okay  well if I was in this for the money  I’d be a millionaire by now  y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.
Phoebe, That’s okay. All right  I’m gonna play song that’s really  really sad. It’s called Magician Box Mix Up. 
Monica,  Hi!
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Oh  can I borrow this?  My milk’s gone bad.
Chandler, Oh  I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half  stole my car.
Monica, So umm  how was your date with Ginger?
Chandler, Great. It was great. She’s ah  she’s great  great looking  great personality  she’s greatness.
Monica, Sounds like she’s got the ah  whole package.
Chandler, Joey told you about the leg  huh?
Monica, Uh-huh.
Chandler, Oh God  it freaked me out. Okay  I know it shouldn’t have  but it did. I mean I like her  I don’t want to stop seeing her  but every so often it’s like ‘Hey  y'know what  where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
Joey,  Morning.
Chandler,  Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
Joey,  Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
Chandler, It came up.
Joey, Listen  I ah  I know it’s a longshot. But  by any chance did she find that funny?
Ross,  So I nodded off a little.
Rachel, Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Ross, Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Rachel, Well okay  how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
Ross, First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all  that little bone  proved that  that particular dinosaur had wings  but didn’t fly.
Rachel, Okay  see now  what I just heard: blah-blah-blah  blah-blah-blah-blah-blah  blah-blah-blah  blah  blah.
Ross, Y'know what  100 million people went to see a movie about what I do  I wonder how many people would go see a movie called  Jurassic Parka.
Rachel, Oh  that is so...
Ross, No-no-no  a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island. 
Rachel, Y'know if what I do is so lame  then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
Ross, No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know  I feel like lately  I feel like you’re slipping away from me  y'know. With this new job  and all these new people  and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb  but I hate that I’m not a part of it.
Rachel, It’s not dumb. But  maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it’s like  I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
Ross, That’s a little clearer.
Rachel, Honey see  it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you  I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know  I’m out there  on my own  and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it  because it’s mine. I  but  I mean is that okay?
Ross, Sure  I-I-I... 
Chandler, No. No. Actually I forgot  what is the deal with that again?
Chandler, No. No. I don’t think so.
Chandler, That’s-that’s my nubbin.
Chandler, It’s kinda a ah  a third nipple kinda thing.
Chandler, Well  y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh  what?
Chandler, You ah  you have  you have to leave  now? How come?
Phoebe,  Oh  I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?
Phoebe, Okay  don’t give me a reason to get mad  okay
Phoebe, No  look  I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it  and you just  you big fat did it anyway. God  y'know what  I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but  I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.
Phoebe, Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right  if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then  okay you can have Smelly Cat  but we won’t be partners. So what’s it gonna be?
Monica, Sorry  Pheebs.
Joey, Yeah. You okay?
Phoebe, Yeah. I actually am  yeah. Y'know life-life’s gonna had you all kinds of stuff  y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, We’d love too.
Phoebe, Okay.  ‘Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.’ That’s all I have so far.
Chandler,  Well hello!
Joey, Where have you been?
Chandler, The doctor.
Ross, Is everything okay?
Chandler, Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples  no waiting.
Monica, Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.
Rachel, What?!!
Monica, Come on! Come on  I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!
Chandler, That was an obvious joke  and I didn’t think of it. Why didn’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God  what have I done!
Joey,  Hey  how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
Monica, I won’t give you anything  but you’ll owe me 2.95.
Joey, Done.
Phoebe,  Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
Monica, Why?  Do you have a report due?
Phoebe, I have a date with this diplomat I met while I was giving free massages outside the UN and  I don’t know where his country is.
Monica, Okay  let’s start with the free messages outside the UN.
Phoebe, Oh!! That’s my new thing. I figure bodies at peace  make peace.
Monica, Wow! You might just get the first Nobel prize in rubbing. So what country is this guy from?
Phoebe, Ick-neck-tree-anis..... There’s a ‘g’ in there.
Monica, Where’s that?
Phoebe, In your atlas!
Monica, I don’t have an atlas.
Phoebe, Oh.
Monica, Oh  but wait I do have a globe.
Phoebe, Oh.
Monica, Hold on.
Joey, So Pheebs what’s this guy like?
Phoebe, Umm  well he’s very dashing  y'know  and umm  very  very sophisticated  and he doesn’t speak any English  but according to his translator  he totally gets me.
Monica, ‘Kay  here you go. 
Phoebe, What is this?
Monica, It’s a globe and  a pencil sharpener.
Chandler,  Hey  does anybody need anything copied? I’m going down to the Xerox place.
Monica, Oh  no thanks.
Chandler, Okay listen  just give me anything I can make two of.
Monica, Well  if you don’t have anything to copy  why are you going down there?
Joey, Yeah  are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?
Chandler, Yeah! You wanna come?
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Chandler, Uh-oh.
Joey, Uh  y'know what  we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.
Chandler,  Okay  that hurt us.
Chandler, Well ah  ........y'know.
Joey, Both of us? 
Joey, We’ll be there.
Chandler, All right  rock on. 
Phoebe, Me too. Although this city is my home  so. So that’s dumb what I said  don’t tell him I said that. Umm  you make something up.  Nice   thank you. This is me. Here.
Phoebe,  Thank you  very much! Oh!  Thank you!
Phoebe,  Okay  y'know what  you don’t have to do that now.  No-no-no-no!! Not him  you don’t!  Well the moment’s over.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe,  See there it is right there.
Monica, Wow! It’s small.
Phoebe, Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Monica, So you had fun  huh?
Phoebe, Yeah. Except for  y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.
Monica, No.
Ross,  Hey.
Ross, What is ah  Rach in her room?
Monica, Oh no  she’s still at work  but she told me to tell you to call her.
Ross, Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn’t she know it’s our anniversary?
Monica, All right ah  Ross  this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.  Call Rachel.
Ross, What’s that on the bottom?
Monica, Oh that’s my doodle of a ladybug  with a top hat.  She’s fancy.
Rachel,  Hello.
Ross, Hey  honey.
Rachel, Oh  hi.
Ross, Hey  what’s going on?
Rachel, Well  there was a disaster in shipping and I’ve got to get this order in. Honey  I’m so sorry  but it looks like I’m gonna be here all night.
Ross, What  do you  well umm  oh how about I come up there?
Rachel, No-no-no  no  honey please  I’ve got  I’ve just have so much to deal with.
Phoebe,  Anyway  I’m going out with Sergei again tonight  and um  could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we  it’s time for our alone time  you two could split off. Y'know  he’s really  he’s kinda cute.
Monica, Yeah  well kinda cute  like really kinda cute  or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Phoebe, Hey  don’t call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!
Chandler, Hey  y'know what  maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Joey, Uh  10:30.
Chandler, What time is it now?
Joey, 4:30.
Chandler, Yeah all right  so we’ll hang out.
Joey, Yeah. Hey  remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Chandler, Yes. Vividly.
Joey, She was kidding about that right?
Chandler, Yeah  I-I-I think so.  Yeah  I-I think so...
Joey, God  that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight  huh?
Chandler, Yeah. Yeah  I mean what  what would we do?
Joey, Dude  I don’t know.
Chandler, She was kidding.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, She was.... But y'know what  just in case  maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Joey, Yeah  for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be  never open your eyes. Y'know  because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.
Chandler, Yeah. Good call  nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed  and  and my hand is out there.... 
Joey, Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh  hey  how do we decide where we...  y'know each would   y'know  be?
Chandler, Right. Right. Well ah  y'know we could flip for it.
Joey, Yeah  I guess  but what’s like heads and what’s tails?
Chandler, Well it you don’t know that  then I don’t want to do this with you.
Rachel,  No  no  no  I’m looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And....  What does it matter  what I’m wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor?  Thank you.  We’re holding.

Ross, Yeah  well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary  boy what an ass am I.
Rachel, But I told you  I didn’t have the time!

Ross, No  but it’d be nice if you realised  it’s just a job!
Rachel, Just a job!
Ross, Yes.
Rachel, Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
Ross, No  hey  I get that  okay  I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya  but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay  I don’t know what to do anymore.
Rachel, Well neither do I!

Rachel, Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again  Ross  no  you’re  you’re  you’re making this too hard.
Ross, Oh I’m  I’m making this too hard. Okay  what do you want me to do.

Monica, Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Phoebe,  Knock  knock  knock  knock  hi. Um  could you please tell Sergei that um  I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.

Monica, Well  I was having a conversation.
Phoebe, Yeah but  Mischa is so interested in you  that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.

Joey, Yeah  tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Chandler, Why? What happened to him?
Joey, Nothing  he’s just really believes in that.
Rachel, Oh  and then  we got into this big  stupid fight. I just  it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger  or something  oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break  I don’t want to take a break.

Phoebe, Well  tell him  apology accepted.
Phoebe, Excuse me  but umm  isn’t he paying for your dinner?
Monica, Hey  the man’s dog just died.
Monica, It will be my pleasure.  My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can’t even say coupons. 
Phoebe, Plate! Yes  plate.
Phoebe, See  we don’t need them.

Joey,  Previously on Friends.
Ross, I mean  I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Rachel, You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?
Ross, Is this about Mark?
Rachel,  Oh my God.

Monica, Rachel  you and Mark?!
Rachel, No  no-no  it’s okay  calm down. Mark and I talked  and I realised how much I love your stupid brother  and  yeah  we got our problems  but I really want to make it work.
Rachel,  Hi  it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please  Ross  you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.

Ross, Chloe  Chloe how’s it coming?!!
Ross, Umm  oh  hey  I don’t know. How about a big one?
Ross, Well then a small one!! Listen  let’s  we kinda have to get going!
Ross, You  you sure you need shoes?  Okay. 
Ross, Yeah  y'know the ah  the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah  she wants to get back together with me. Oh  I found it!!
Ross, Yeah!
Ross, Yes  yes I am  one of the many things I’m feeling. Well.... 
Ross, Oh  thank you.  Hey  hey.  Rachel!!!!
Rachel, Hi. Ohhh  you got my message.
Ross, Yeah  oh hey  you are right on time.
Rachel, So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross, Yes  you can  very much.
Ross,  Ahhhh!! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey  why are you mopping your ceiling?
Monica, Oh  there’s banana on it.
Phoebe, Wow  I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Monica, So then you know? 
Phoebe, The mailman was downstairs  so I brought up your mail.
Monica, Oh  good. Thanks.
Phoebe, Now what is Fabutec?
Monica, Okay  all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um  but I saw this info-mercial  and um  I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before  except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing  it just  it looked so amazing....
Phoebe, Waxine!!
Monica, Yes! Have you seen it?
Phoebe, Oh  it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Monica, I know!!
Phoebe, God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?
Monica, Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Phoebe, They have the best stuff in there.
Chandler, Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey, Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you  you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Ross, You think?! God  I  ah  I’m in hell. I mean what  what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like  ‘I love you and  and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is  ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
Chandler, Well  before we answer that  I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Ross, What?! Look  we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here  right. How am I supposed to do that here  without being totally honest with each other?
Joey, Look  Ross look  I’m on board about this totally honesty thing  I am  just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.
Chandler, He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit  and you’re just gonna hurt her.
Joey, Yeah  and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.
Ross, Yeah  but don’t you think....
Chandler, All right look  if you absolutely have to tell her  at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.
Ross, Yeah  okay. 
Joey, All right  okay  now  we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?
Ross, What trail?
Joey,  The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!
Ross, Oh  I-I don’t think there’s any trail.
Chandler, Okay  okay-okay  ah  Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel. And that’s the trail  I did it!
Phoebe,  After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one 
Monica, Did that!
Phoebe, Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Monica, Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe, Was it not pain-free?
Monica, No. It was painful. Oh my God   they should call it Pain-zine  now with a little wax.
Phoebe, Huh  well  the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.
Monica, That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey  y'know if you don’t believe me  please  by my guest.
Phoebe,  Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica, Now  are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?
Ross,  Chloe? Hi..
Ross, You took my watch?
Ross, Just you keep it  listen did you  did you tell anyone about us?
Ross, Exactly. So you didn’t  didn’t mention anything to Issac right?
Ross, You tell  of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey  Issac. Issac  hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...
Ross, Yes  I suppose I am a dog. But Issac  see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Ross, Yeah  that’s the one. Listen  I don’t want to hurt her.
Ross, Yeah. Listen  can you keep this information to yourself?
Ross, Actually  no  we’re not.
Ross, No  we’re not.
Ross, No  we’re not!!
Ross, Right.
Ross, Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.
Ross,  Jasmine?
Ross, We met at Phoebe’s birthday party  I’m  I’m Ross Geller.
Ross, Yes  I did.
Ross, Very bad.
Ross, I’m agreeing with you. Did you  listen  did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Ross, Okay  Jasmine  please  please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much  and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Ross, Thank you  thank you.
Ross,  Who’s your roommate?
Ross, Gunther! Gunther. Gunther  please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Monica, Ow!
Phoebe, Oh!!
Monica, Ow!! Ow!!
Phoebe, Ow!!!
Phoebe, We’re all right.
Monica, It’s okay  it’s okay.
Phoebe, We’re all right.
Monica, We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler, Off?!!
Phoebe, For your information  this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Chandler, Yeah  well I don’t think you can make that statement  unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Joey, Yeah  I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men  that’s all. I mean  come on  it’s just a little wax.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  come here. 
Chandler, Oh  that’s mature.
Joey, Okay  fine  so now what  I just pull it off?
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Monica, That’s right.
Ross,  Come on  Rachel  come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Rachel, I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!
Monica, What?
Chandler, Nothing  nothing.
Monica,  Rachel said everything was okay.
Phoebe,  What  what are they talking about?
Ross, Rachel?
Rachel, Just get away from me!
Ross, No  it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Rachel, A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Phoebe, Whe-where did he put it?!
Rachel, Ross  you had sex with another woman!
Monica, Oh my God.
Phoebe, Oh  I knew something had to be wrong  because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Chandler, Yeah  well  I guess they had a fight  and he got drunk....
Monica, Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!
Chandler,  He has sex  and we get hit in our heads.
Rachel,  Y'know what  I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ross, No!!
Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler, Uh-oh.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Was she good?
Joey, Don’t answer that.
Rachel, Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it  let’s talk about it!! How was she?
Ross, She was...
Joey, Awful! Horrible!
Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
Ross, She  she was different.
Joey, Ewwwww!
Chandler, Uh-oh.
Rachel, Good different?
Ross, Nobody likes change.
Ross, What? Okay  okay  okay  okay.
Phoebe, Should we do something?
Chandler, Yeah  never cheat on Rachel.
Ross, I’m sorry  okay  I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself  and this morning I was so  I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy  and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Rachel, Whoa!! Whoa  whoa  wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there  when I was in there?!
Ross, Listen. Oh hey  hey  the important thing was that she meant  she meant nothing to me!
Rachel, And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Ross, Look  I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Rachel, We were on a break!
Ross, That  for all I knew would  could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Rachel, You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Ross, Look  I’m not trying to get out of anything  okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Rachel, Well  you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Joey, Y'know what  I don’t think we should listen to this anymore. 
Monica,  What  what are you doing? You can’t go out there.
Joey, Why not?!  I’m hungry.
Monica, Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
Rachel, God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Ross, Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you  I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
Rachel, Oh  that is so sweet. I think I’m falling in love with you all over again.
Chandler, Y'know what  I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Joey, Yeah  we’ll be fine.
Ross, Look Rachel  I wanted to tell you  I thought I should  I-I did  and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Chandler,  Wax the door shut  we’re never leaving  ever.
Phoebe, Hi  it’s Phoebe. Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack  ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now  and I’m not there.
Ross, Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?
Rachel, All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Ross,  Yes I would.
Rachel, You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me  and been naked with me  and made love to me?
Ross,  Yes.
Rachel, You knew that our hot  sweaty  writhing bodies were....
Ross,  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay  okay  yeah  I would have been devastated but  I would still want to be with you. Because it’s  I mean it’s you.
Ross, What? Come on Rach  tell me what you’re thinking?
Rachel, I’m thinking  I’m gonna order a pizza.
Ross, Order a pizza like  ‘I forgive you?’
Joey, Oh man  pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.
Phoebe, We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
Chandler, Oh great  food with hair on it.
Phoebe, No  not the used wax.
Chandler, Because that would be crazy?
Ross, Hey  can I  can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.
Rachel, Fine.  Hi! Yes  I’d like to order a large pizza.
Ross, No anchovies.
Rachel, With ah  extra anchovies.
Ross, That’s okay  I’ll just pick ‘em off.
Rachel, Yeah  and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
Ross, You can have the last piece  if you want.
Rachel, Well  I should think so. You slept with someone.
Phoebe, They’re gonna get through this  aren’t they?
Chandler, Yeah  come on  it’s Ross and Rachel  they’ve got too.
Monica, What if they don’t?
Joey, You think I need a new walk?
Chandler, What?
Joey, Well y'know  I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know  y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.
Chandler, Are you actually saying these words?
Ross, What  now you’re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel  I-I’m sorry  okay  I’m sorry  I was out of my mind. I thought I’d lost you  I didn’t know what to do. Come on! Come on  how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don’t cheat right  I  that’s not me  I’m not Joey!
Joey, Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah  okay.
Monica, Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Phoebe, Yeah  y'know  people can be so self-involved.
Ross, Y'know what  y'know what  I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that  that break  okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that  that ran when things got just a little rough!
Rachel, That’s....
Ross, That’s what?!
Rachel, That is neither here nor there.
Ross, Okay  well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again  Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or  do you wanna bail?  Look  I   I did a terrible  stupid  stupid thing. Okay? And I’m sorry  I wish I could take it back  but I can’t.  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel  I love you so much.
Rachel, No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away  okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
Ross, Okay  okay  okay.
Rachel,  I think you should go.
Ross, What?
Rachel,  I really think you need to go now.
Ross,  Okay  okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...
Rachel, Yeah  what the hell did I know!
Ross, Look  look  there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay   I can’t imagine  I can’t imagine my life without you.  Without  without these arms  and your face  and this heart. Your good heart Rach   and  and....
Rachel,  No. I can’t  you’re a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never  ever hurt me  ever. God  and now I just can’t stop picturing with her  I can’t   it doesn’t matter what you say  or what you do  Ross. It’s just changed  everything. Forever.
Ross,  Yeah  but this can’t be it  I mean.
Rachel, Then how come it is?
Phoebe, They’ve been quiet for a long time.
Joey, Maybe she killed him?
Chandler, Let’s go.
Chandler,  Is that your new walk?
Joey,  No  I really have to pee.
Joey, Can I see the comics?
Chandler, This is the New York Times.
Joey, Okay  may I see the comics?
Monica, Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?
Chandler, We are. He’s meeting us here.
Monica, No! Rachel is meeting us here.
Phoebe, Oh come on  they can be in the same room.
Joey, Yeah  you shoulda been there last night.
Phoebe, Why? What happened now?
Joey, Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place  Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
Chandler, Yeah y-you  how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Joey, Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Phoebe, Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
Joey, Well  I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened  that she should of forgiven him by now.
Phoebe, Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God  although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God  this is like 60 Minutes  okay  when  when  at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
Chandler, Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man  I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Phoebe, Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together  they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out  and everyone was happy....
Joey, I had the same dream!
Phoebe, Yeah  and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
Joey, Oh  I had the opposite dream.
Chandler, Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay  I mean it’s been a week.
Joey, Yeah  I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Monica, It’s never taken you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Monica,  Okay  let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, Let’s get the show on it!
Rachel, Okay  let me just get a cup of coffee.
Monica, Oh Rachel  I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.
Rachel, Closer than here?
Phoebe,  Oh  hey  look  I found coffee!  Okay  let’s skedaddle.
Rachel, Wait  I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.
Phoebe, Okay  your highness.
Phoebe,  Um  Rachel I’m really sorry.  That’s okay  do you wanna get back together?  Yeah  okay.  Did anyone else hear that?!
Rachel,  Is he here?
Chandler, No.
Rachel, Oh.  Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!
Rachel, You guys are gonna love meee! Okay  check it out  Thursday night  five tickets  Calvin Klein lingerie show  and you guys are coming with me.  Okay  I said that out loud right?
Chandler, Yes  yes  it’s just that we ah  we kinda all ready  made plans with Ross.
Rachel, Oh  well okay. Well  there you go.
Phoebe, No  it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie  and he wants y'know  us to check it out.
Rachel, Hm-mm.
Chandler, Yeah  he’s really excited about it too  he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Rachel, Ohh!
Monica, We’re sorry honey.
Rachel, Oh  it’s okay. 
Joey, Rach  it’s  it’s ah  it’s not that we don’t want to  really.  Are we talking models in their underwear?
Rachel, And heels.
Joey,   Ross  did ask us first  and we set that night aside.
Rachel, No  hey  come on  if he asked you first  that’s only fair. 
Phoebe, Ohhh boy  do I feel bad.
Joey, Oh yeah.
Monica, Very bad.
Phoebe, Chandler what are you doing?!
Monica, Chandler!!
Chandler,  Oh my God!
Joey, You’re smoking again?!
Chandler, Well  actually  yesterday I was smoking again. Today  I’m  I’m smoking still.
Phoebe, Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
Chandler, Look  I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce  which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Monica, Weren’t you nine?!
Chandler, Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something  that ah  first smoke after nap time....
Chandler, Oh that’s great  with my luck  that’s gonna be him.
Phoebe, Him? Him  Ross?
Chandler, Nope  hymn 253  His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. 
Rachel, Hi! Uhh  do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold  and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first  right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.
Rachel, Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!
Chandler, Hey  shut up!! You’re not my real Mom!!
Joey,  Hey  can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!
Phoebe, Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Ross, Look  you guys I just wanna say  I really  really appreciate you spending this time with me. It’s been a pretty hard time right now  so I just wanna say thanks.
Chandler, Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Ross, Oh hey  hey  huh  how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay  and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh  huh  what do you think?  Two days of darts  it’ll be great!
Joey, It’ll be great for next weekend.
Ross, No  no  no  this weekend guys!
Joey, It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean   it’ll be grrreat.
Ross, What’s going on?
Phoebe, Well  we were um  sorta invited to go skiing  y'know Rachel’s sister’s cabin. 
Ross, So  for the whole weekend?
Monica, We’re really sorry  but um  she did ask us first.
Ross, Yeah  that’s okay  I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself  y'know then I totally  totally understand.
Phoebe, Y'know what  I can stay  I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift  I just went around and around.
Joey, Uh  Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab  but y'know what  I’ll stay.
Monica, Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.
Ross, What a pity stay?
Monica, No! We’re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Ross, Pity food? Y'know what that’s okay  all right  I don’t need any of you to stay  okay nobody stays.
Chandler, Well  then  I might as well offer to stay.
Joey,  Hey  does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
Monica, Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
Chandler,  Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Joey, What? Mine aren’t tinted.
Phoebe, Chandler!!
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, What does the sign say?
Chandler, Beam me up Jesus.
Phoebe, No  the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.
Chandler, Okay  well  then  I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Phoebe, Please!
Monica, No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Chandler, Oh  come on  there’s a rest stop right up there! Come on  I really have to goooooooooo.
Joey, Oh  now I have to go!!
Chandler, Here we go. Okay  brace yourselves.
Monica, What?
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Ow!
Phoebe,  Aren’t you gonna go?
Rachel, No. Thank you.
Monica,  No  Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
Rachel, Well  they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is ‘no tissue  no tuschy.’  Well  if everybody’s going. 
Phoebe, No  y'know what don’t close it  ‘cause the... keys...are in there.
Chandler, Oh  no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Joey, What’s going on?
Chandler,  My lighter’s in there! 
Chandler, Damn!  The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!
Joey, Relax okay  I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Chandler, Oh I do! Op  no  wait a minute  I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
Monica, So  if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced  you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Joey, Look  I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey  one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Monica, What?!
Rachel, What?!
Joey, Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
Monica, Please!!
Joey, Whoever has the biggest boobs  has the biggest bra  therefore has the biggest wire.
Joey, If you wanna get back in the car  we need the wire  your call.
Phoebe, Okay  Monica’s are the biggest.
Monica, These tiny  little non-breasts?! Please  it’s gotta be Rachel.
Rachel, What  no  no  no  mine are deceptively small I mean  I-I-I actually sometimes  st-stuff my bra.
Monica, All right then  your bra would still be big.
Rachel, No  I stuff outside the bra.
Chandler, Ladies  ladies  let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe  Rachel take off Monica’s bra.
Phoebe, All right  forget it  nevermind  you can have mine.
Rachel,  Chandler  what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.
Chandler, Well  I thought if I littered  that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Phoebe,  Okay  there.
Joey, Thank you Phoebe  that is very  very generous.
Chandler, Okay  now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
Joey,  And there you go!
Monica, Chandler!!
Chandler, At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Phoebe, Okay.  Oh  no!
Rachel, What  what’s it  what’s going on?
Phoebe, Yeah  this has happened before.
Rachel, So you know how to fix it?
Phoebe, Yep. Put more gas in.
Ross,  Hey.
Ross, Well  oh just ah  I was just wondering  when you and I split up  did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Ross, Where’s Ben?
Ross, Ahh.  Ooh  is this a ah  is this a bad time?
Ross, Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh  January?
Ross, Ah!  Oh.
Ross, Umm  candles  champagne  yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever  y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime  money in the bank  so Rachel and I broke up.
Ross, Yeah  well.
Ross, Oh yeah  I’d love that.
Ross, I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. 
Phoebe, Okay  yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.
Rachel, Great!
Phoebe, Yeah  what town are we near?
Monica, Freemont. West-Westmont  ah Westburg?
Phoebe,  Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?
Rachel, Yeah  we are definitely on Route 27.
Phoebe, Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay  either 93 or 76?
Rachel, I don’t know  I’m sorry  I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Phoebe, Okay.  Hey  can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop  and  and also 93?  Okay!  Yeah  no they don’t do that.
Rachel, Ugh  okay  well somebody will come and save us.
Monica, Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross  maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Rachel, No! No  I am not getting in a car with Ross  we will just have to live here!
Phoebe, But if...
Rachel, No you guys  I am not getting in a car with him  you’ll have to think of something else.
Phoebe, Oh good  oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Monica, So the going for help went well?
Joey, Oh yeah  Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Chandler, I have the lung capacity of a two year old. 
Monica, Then why are you smoking?
Chandler, Well it’s very unsettling.
Ross, ....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know  I mean they just took off  took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t  I don’t need them  huh  I’ve got you guys now as friends  you and Susan.
Ross,  717?  Where’s 717?  Hey  you’ve have more of these for Susan right?
Phoebe,   Ross  thank God.
Ross, Pheebs? What  why are you whispering?
Phoebe, I ate a bug.
Monica,  Hey Rach  the tampons here are only a penny. Let’s stock up. 
Phoebe, Listen Ross  we ran out of gas  and we don’t know where we are  so we can’t get a tow truck.
Ross, Oh  now you want a favour?
Phoebe, Yes  please.
Ross, Well  oh  I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs  but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now  but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?

Ross, No  Rachel doesn’t want me to....
Ross, Yeah  you’re right.
Ross, We were on a break!!! Okay!!  We were  we were...   yeah. Where are you? I’ll find you. 
Ross, Oh  you-you’re-you’re one to talk.
Joey, Okay  done.
Monica,  What’s ‘pleh’?
Joey, That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
Monica, Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
Rachel,  Op  op  car! Car!!  Ugh!!!
Phoebe, Oh  it’s Ross on one of his drives!
Phoebe, Hi!
Rachel, What is he doing here?!
Ross, He is saving your butt  ah  unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here  in which case I can just mosey on  I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Rachel, All right!! Fine! Fine.
Joey, Arrrghh!!
Chandler, Oh no  now it’s not gonna make any sense!
Phoebe,  You guys  what  what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?
Chandler, Oh  this is horrible  it’s just horrible.
Joey, Guys  do you think we should ask Ross to come along?
Monica, I know  what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Rachel, Ask me what?
Monica, Umm  if ah  it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Rachel, You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Ross, Excuse me?
Chandler, It’s horrible.
Ross,  Oh please  can’t I come to your special  magical cabin?
Rachel, Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
Ross, Oh-oh  hitting me where it hurts  my ski skills.
Monica, Here we go again.
Joey, I-I can’t handle this  you guys.
Chandler, Y'know what  I can handle it  handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah  middle part of my first name.
Ross, All right Pheebs  your cab’s ready.
Rachel, All right  let’s go!
Ross, You’re welcome.
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry  were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
Ross, We were on a break!

Ross, Hey-hey  it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so  Monica agrees with me.
Rachel,  What?!
Monica,  I don’t know.
Ross, That’s what you said last night.
Monica, What I said was  was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, Really Joey?
Joey,  What?
Phoebe, Y'know what  but there is  there is no right or wrong  here.
Rachel, No  I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
Ross, Obviously not to Joey.
Joey,  What?
Ross,  Look both  Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.
Chandler, Guys  guys  guess who I am?! 
Phoebe, Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  Look what you’re doing to Chandler!!   Yeah  look  we know this is really  really hard for you guys. Okay?  You don’t  all right you don’t have to love each other  okay? You don’t  you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please  you have to figure out a way to be around each other.
Joey, Yeah  and not put us in the middle.
Phoebe, Yeah  otherwise  I mean that’s  that’s  that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want?  Can you be civil?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, I can.
Phoebe, Okay. Good  all right  let’s get back in the car  ‘cause it’s freezing  and my chest is unsupported.
Joey, Oh what  wait  wait a second  I mean  what are we doing? Who’s going with who?
Ross, Look  you guys  you guys should go.  No  I’m  you  you planned this all out  and I don’t want to ruin it  so you guys should just go.
Joey, Come on man  you drove all the way up here.
Ross, No  no  really  I’ve got to take the car back anyway  I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben  It’s fine  no guilt I promise.
Rachel, Thank you.
Monica, All right  we’ll call you when we get back.
Ross, Okay.
Phoebe, Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.
Ross, Okay.
Phoebe, Or  or the rodeo!!
Ross, That would be great.
Phoebe, Okay!
Chandler, I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Ross, I know!
Phoebe, Bye!!!
Ross,  Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
Ross, Oh  great! Listen  oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could  ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
Ross, Yeah  well it came to about $112  but what the hell  just call it an even 110?
Ross, Okay.
Ross, So they ah  they all took off  it was pretty hard watching them go  y'know?
Ross,  So I’m gonna take off then!
Monica,  What’s so funny?
Joey, Oh  nothing  no. It’s an acting exercise  I’m practising my fake laugh.
Monica, Oh. 
Joey, What-what’s so funny?
Chandler, Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, No-no  why don’t you hang on to that one.
Chandler, Okay  that’s like the least fun game ever.
Rachel, Well  I’m really sick of your smoking  so I brought something that is going to help you quit. 
Chandler, Oh.  Nope  that patch is no good. 
Rachel, Come on  it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
Ross, Pffhah.
Rachel,  What’s your problem?
Ross, Nothing  it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Rachel, Ross  I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Ross, Hey  that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Rachel, Oh right  ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Phoebe, All right  y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather  and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Chandler, Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Ross, Here you go.
Rachel, Oh  y'know what  I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
Ross, Sorry. 
Phoebe, Oh my God!!
Phoebe, Frank! Hi!
Phoebe, What are you doing here?
Phoebe, What happened?
Phoebe, But  also  what happened between you and your Mom?
Phoebe, Your getting married?!
Phoebe, My little brother’s getting married!!
Phoebe, Do I?
Phoebe, Yeah  I do  yeah.
Chandler, Y'know  I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
Phoebe, Yeah  isn’t it fantastic?
Monica, Yeah  ah  but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?
Phoebe, What  he’s 18.
Ross, Exactly  it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Joey, Yeah  or-or to get a hooker.
Chandler, Always illegal Joe.
Phoebe, Yeah  I’m a big surprise.
Monica, So  um  how-how did you guys meet?
Chandler, If that doesn’t keep kids in school  what will?
Ross, And so now you guys are gonna be married?
Rachel, Oh my God!! Great!
Phoebe, Wow  kids. Frank  are you sure you’re ready for that?
Phoebe, Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.
Monica, And y'know what  I just realised  in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys  Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here  you gotta set me up  you gotta get me back in the game.
Rachel, Well  that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Monica,  Pete  can I get you something else?
Monica, Haven’t you and I covered that topic?
Monica, Aww  the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig  and the big boobs  and the fact that I serve you food.
Rachel,  Well  I mean  are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning  y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray  and boobs flung over the night stand  y'know.
Monica, I mean really  think about it.
Phoebe, No  I know  I know  that this is Frank’s life   y'know. Y'know  I don’t want to be all judgmental  y'know  but this is sick  it’s sick and wrong!
Ross, Pheebs  what  is it the age thing?
Phoebe, No-no  oh  I’m fine with the age thing y'know  until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!
Joey, Pheebs  he seems to enjoy it.
Phoebe, But  I mean  do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank   and it-it’s not fair to the babies  and y'know what  it’s not good home economics.
Joey, Well  have-have you told him how you feel?
Phoebe, Yes. Not out loud.
Ross, Pheebs  if you don’t tell him  soon he’s gonna be married  and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
Phoebe, Yeah  but if I do tell him  then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom  I can’t.  But  you guys can  please you gotta talk him out of it.
Phoebe, Come on  you guys  you have nothing to lose  I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
Phoebe, Okay  I’m gonna go get Frank. 
Joey, So  we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say  “Hey  let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes ” remember? And then  and then  you turn to me and say  “Nah  let’s just hang out at your place.” Well  that was a nice move dumb ass.
Rachel, I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
Monica, Nah  he doesn’t do anything for me.
Rachel, Monica  last Saturday night  what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
Monica, Well  umm  Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….  All right  I get your point.
Rachel, All right.
Chandler,  Hi.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Y'know  I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Monica, Uh  yeah.
Rachel, Hey  how are those tapes working out for ya?
Chandler, Y'know what  pretty good.
Rachel, Yeah?
Chandler, Good! I haven’t smoked yet today  I feel great  and-and-and confident  that is a stunning blouse.
Rachel, Thank you.
Monica, Here you go.
Chandler, Thanks
Rachel, Hey Mon  let’s give Pete a chance Come on  he was funny  he seems really nice  and that check thing was adorable.
Chandler, What check thing?
Monica, As a joke  this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20 000 tip. His number is on the check  he just did so I’d call him.
Chandler,  Pete Becker. Pete…   Is this him?
Monica, That’s Bill Clinton.
Chandler, Who’s he huggin’?
Monica, Oh my God! That’s Pete! But why is Bill huggin’ Pete?
Chandler, This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
Rachel, We use it!!
Chandler, There you go!!
Rachel, Oh my God  Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.
Monica, I’m not gonna go out with him.
Rachel, Oh my God  I can’t believe this is a real $20 000 check  oh this is just so exciting.
Monica, Or incredibly offensive.
Rachel, Oh yeah  sure  that too.
Chandler,  What?
Ross, All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.
Joey, Yeah  come on  think about it. You’re 18  okay  she’s 44  when you’re 36  she’s gonna be 88.
Joey, Look  the point is  there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!
Ross, Yeah  he-he’s right  he’s right. This is your time y'know  yeah  you’re young  you’re-you’re weird  chicks dig that.

Phoebe, Yeah  I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
Phoebe, Y'know what  forget it. It’s ruined.
Phoebe, Or instead  maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
Monica, What the hell is this? 
Monica, Seriously  what is this supposed to mean?
Monica, You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean  what’s-what’s the deal? Are you  are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Monica, What?!
Monica, Okay  umm  you’re a loon.
Monica, I don’t know.
Monica, ‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Phoebe, Okay. Whoa  sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  sure. So  how was your day?
Phoebe, What umm  what happened?
Phoebe, Oh no. Did umm  did she say why?
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah  no  I don’t  I don’t know. But  y'know what  maybe it’s just all for the best?
Phoebe, Oh  sweetie  oh. 
Phoebe, Uh  well I can tell you why. It’s  it’s because of me. But  y'know what  I only did it because I love you. Okay?
Phoebe, Umm  well I  I kinda had a little chat with Alice  and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together  y'know. And you’re gonna see it to  one day  you really  really will.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay  but.
Rachel, Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!
Chandler,  Oh my God! 
Monica, Guys  please  I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
Chandler, Okay  okay  just because he buys you dinner  does not mean you owe him anything.
Monica, I know!!
Chandler, Okay  then get the lobster!
Monica,   Hey!
Rachel, Hi!!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hi!
Joey, Hey  how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?

Monica, Oh come on  it’s only fair  you paid for the flight. Now is  is that enough lire?
Monica, Why  how much is that?
Joey, Every night!!
Phoebe, Hey  Frank. Look  okay  I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing  but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.
Phoebe, Yeah  but not just that.
Phoebe, None the less.
Phoebe, That’s right  exactly.  All right  it’s a good bye kiss  that’s good.  Bye-bye.  Okay  no  the important thing is that you see what I’m saying  y'know  just y'know  this is clearly wrong.  Okay  I’ve decided I’m gonna let this happen! Okay  can I just get my purse?  Okay  all right  good. .
Joey,  Joey’s your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday.  And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Rachel, Thank you.
Rachel, Hi! All right  let’s go shoppin’!!
Rachel, Oh  okay.
Rachel, Wow! Umm....

Chandler, Mr. Millionaire  new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Monica, He’s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He’s so funny  and sooo sweet  and I’m not attracted to him at all!!
Ross, Still?!
Monica, Noo!! It’s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he’s like the perfect guy  he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.
Chandler, Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Monica, Two.
Chandler, Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Joey,  Oh mommie  oh daddie  I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie  oh daddie  I am a big old baddie! 
Ross, I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Chandler, Yeah  either that  or Gloria Estefan was right  eventually  the rhythm is going to get you.
Joey, Good.  Hey.

Joey, Hey  I’ve done plays before. I’m a serious actor.
Joey, See  I actually can pour milk  but I got you believing that I couldn’t. Now  see  that’s acting.
Joey, Yeah  that was real.
Phoebe, Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Rachel, I know.
Phoebe, What  so what are you gonna tell him?
Rachel, Well  I told him I would think about it  but I’m gonna tell him no.
Phoebe, Huh.
Rachel, I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now.  Oh  but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming  cute guy  who’s asking me to go out with him  which I’m allowed to do  and I felt guilty. Y'know  like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
Phoebe, Wow. So  okay  maybe that means that  you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
Rachel, I don’t have any issues with my Father.
Phoebe, Okay  so it’s probably just the Ross thing then.
Joey, I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial  and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay  and whenever I can’t do it  they’re all like-like laughing at me.
Ross,  Hello.
Ross, So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Joey, Wow  what-what do you think she wants?
Ross, Well  maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Chandler, It’s possible. You are very loveable  I’d miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive.
Ross, Then be supportive like a guy.
Chandler,  If I broke up with you  I’d miss you.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, You ah  wanted to see me?
Rachel, Yeah. Ahh  here’s a box of your stuff. 
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Oh  y'know  it’s just like hats  and a shirt  and CD’s  just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
Ross, What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?
Rachel, No. Ross  it  it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know  move on. I mean  I mean don’t’ you think?
Ross, Yes.
Rachel, Yeah?
Ross, Yes  I do.
Rachel, Good.
Ross, Yeah  I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!
Rachel, Ross  you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
Ross, It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!
Rachel, Okay  all right  give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.

Rachel, You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!

Ross, Awwwahuh  no  no  no!!
Rachel, Huh?
Ross, I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! 
Rachel, You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
Ross, Oh  yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...
Rachel,  yeah-yeah-yeah!!
Ross, Oh-oh  okay  okay!  If you don’t mind I’m gonna the rest of my stuff  and relax  in my favourite shirt.  You have a pleasant evening. 
Phoebe, So  you’re like a zillionaire? 
Chandler, And you’re our age. You’re our age.
Phoebe, Y'know what  you should like  you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.
Phoebe, Yeah  or  or  or  Mississ-Pete.
Joey, Oh  oh  I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Chandler, That’s not a state Joe.
Joey, Oh  and Mississ-Pete is?
Chandler, You’re our age!
Monica, Absolutely!  Now get out of here you!!   Okay  I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look  is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old  or they’re too young  and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me  and who’s absolutely perfect for me  and there’s like zip going on! I mean  seriously  does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!
Phoebe, Yeah  kinda.
Joey, Well  why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me  and it’s nothin’.  Nothing.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Oh  hey  how about this one. Ah  it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah  I-I don’t know why my character likes you either  I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
Joey, It does in mine!
Chandler, I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter  I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?
Ross, You bug me.
Chandler, Is there any chance you didn’t see that?
Chandler, Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!
Ross, I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know  she’d say no  but here we are! Right? We just broke up  first thing she does!
Chandler, You didn’t just break up.
Ross, Hey  it’s been like three weeks!
Chandler, You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Ross, Here they come  here they come. Oh-ho  if she kisses him goodnight  I’m gonna kill myself  I swear. I can’t  I can’t watch this.  Come on  date over! Date over! Uh-oh  here we go  she’s going in.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I  I can’t see anything but the door closed!!
Chandler, And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Ross, Okay  I have to do something. I mean  I have  I have to stop it!
Chandler, Stop what?!
Ross, I don’t know  but I ah  I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
Chandler, No!! You can’t!!
Ross, Look  they must be stopped!
Chandler, I am your friend  and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!
Ross, I need juice! People need juice!!
Chandler, Look man!
Ross, People need juice!
Chandler, Listen to me!! 
Ross, Juice  I need...
Chandler, She’s moving on! Okay  if it’s not this guy  it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole  you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay  man? It’s over.
Ross, Yeah  okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, It’s just I miss her so much.
Chandler, I know. 
Rachel, Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing  she can be like  ‘Where’s number 27?!’
Rachel, Y'know what?
Rachel, I can’t do this.
Rachel, Well  oh  Mark  I’m doing this for the wrong reasons  y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry  it’s not very fair to you.
Rachel, Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
Rachel, You sure?
Monica, Sure.
Monica,  Well  with all these doctors and nurses  I’m gonna say  midget rodeo.
Monica, Okay. Umm  y'know  I don’t think  I don’t think I told you this  but umm  I just got out of a really serious relationship.
Monica, So I did tell you. Okay  y'know  that really isn’t the thing. Umm  the thing is that  right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?
Monica, I so wanna be attracted to you.
Monica, I’m sorry.
Monica, It’s not?
Monica, Well  um  look I-I don’t want this to come our wrong  but ah  you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn’t attracted too.
Chandler, I don’t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!! 
Chandler,  I wasn’t doing anything.  Uh-oh  what did she do now?
Joey, Just because she went to Yale drama  she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since  since  sliced bread!
Chandler, Ah  Sliced Bread  a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
Joey, God  I just  I hate her! I hate her!! With her  ‘Oh  I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh  I’m so pretty ’ and ‘Ooh  I smell so good.’
Chandler, I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Joey, Hey  Chandler  can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
Chandler, I’m talking about you. You big  big freak.
Joey, Oh.  Ohh. Ohh  you’re out of your mind.
Chandler, Hey  you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
Joey, Oh  yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Joey, Well  why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me  and nothin’.  Nothing.
Joey, Better?
Joey, Ah  Kate?
Joey, You ah  you forgot your shoes.
Joey, Hey  listen you ah....
Joey, ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Joey, Yeah  yeah sure  goodnight.
Phoebe,  Hey!  Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman  Silverman...
Chandler, ‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
Phoebe, It isn’t?
Chandler, No  it’s not like  like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider  man. Y'know like ah  like Goldman is a last name  but there’s no Gold Man.
Phoebe, Oh  okay. There should be Gold Man!
Rachel,  Hey!
Monica, Hey  Rach  how was work?
Rachel, Oh  great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
Monica, By the way  Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Rachel, Oh  well  I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out  it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... 
Monica, Something wrong?
Rachel,  No. Nothing. 
Chandler, So  ahh  what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Phoebe, Okay well  he would turn things to gold.
Chandler, What about things that are already gold?
Phoebe, Ahh  his work is done.
Chandler, Okay  let’s play my game now.
Phoebe, Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! 
Chandler, Wait a minute  wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!
Joey, Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?
Monica, Wow  you’re really crazy about her  huh?
Joey, Oh  you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her  but then she goes home with the director  and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!
Phoebe, Oh  it’s so great to see you feeling like this!
Ross,  Hey!
Ross, Monica  uh Dad called this morning and ah  Aunt Silvia passed away.
Monica, Yes!! Yes! Yeah  yeah  yeah!
Ross, We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Phoebe, Wait  am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad  in a way.
Ross, Well ah  Aunt Silvia was  well not a nice person.
Monica, Oh  she was a cruel  cranky  old bitch!   And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
Ross, You get the dollhouse.
Monica, I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe, Wow  a house for dolls  that is so cool! When I was kid  I had a barrel.
Joey, Uh  Pheebs  you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Phoebe, No  just a barrel.
Monica, Y'know what  you can play with my dollhouse.
Phoebe, Really?! Really?!
Monica, Any time you want. Y'know  when I was younger  all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse  but no!! It was to be looked at  but never played with.
Chandler, My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Rachel, Hey  Sophie!
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, Thanks for lunch  Chandler. Y'know  you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.
Chandler, Oh  that’s-that’s okay  no problem. 
Rachel, Honey um  honey  you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?
Chandler, Yes  I realise that.
Rachel, Summer catalogue! 
Chandler, That’s the stuff! 
Rachel,  Joanna  this is my friend Chandler Bing  Joanna.
Chandler, Thanks  it’s ah  Gaelic  for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah  I’m gonna go  nice  nice meeting you.
Rachel, Bye  Chandler.
Rachel, Oh  nothing  he’s just goofy like that  I actually  hardly notice it anymore.
Rachel, No!! No! He’s not married  or involved  with anyone!
Rachel, Well  I’ll ask him for you  if you want me too?
Monica, Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded  that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Chandler, Hello.
Phoebe, Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It’s so beautiful.
Monica, I know!!!
Phoebe, So  I’m here  ready to play.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, I brought a bunch of stuff for the house  so check it out. Ha-ha. 
Monica, What’s this?
Phoebe, That’s a dog  every house should have a dog.
Monica, Not one that can pee on the roof.
Phoebe, Well  maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Chandler,  And is this in case the house sneezes?
Phoebe, No  no  that’s the ghost for the attic.
Monica, I don’t want a ghost.
Phoebe, Well  nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one  because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Ross, Wait a minute  the house was built on radioactive waste  and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
Phoebe, Okay  obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.
Rachel,  Hey!
Rachel, I need to talk to you!
Ross, Sure  what’s up?
Rachel, Oh  sorry. I meant Chandler.
Ross, I-I know. Well if something comes up... 
Chandler, Oh  I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Rachel, Okay  my boss  Joanna  when you left  she started asking questions about you...
Chandler, Oh-ho  liked what she saw  huh? Dug my action  did she? Checkin’ out the Chan-Chan man!
Rachel,  That was  surreal. Okay  what do think? Are you interested at all?
Chandler, Yeah  she seemed cool  attractive. I’ll do it.
Rachel, Oh thank you  Chandler  this is so great  she’s gonna love me.
Phoebe,  Okay  dinosaur attack!! Quick  everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh!  Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Monica, Okay  Phoebe  y'know what? That-that’s it  that’s it  all right? No dinosaurs  no ghosts  no giant dogs  okay? They’re not the right size  they’re not Victorian  and they just don’t go.
Phoebe, Okay   fine. Come dinosaur  we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Ross, Uh  Pheebs  while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs  they-they don’t go  rrroof!
Phoebe, The little ones do.
Joey, Hey  Kate!

Phoebe, Oh  okay  it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this. 
Monica, It’s very interesting  Phoebe.
Rachel, What’s this?
Phoebe, The Licorice Room  you can eat all the furniture. And  when guests come over  they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
Ross, This is the coolest house ever!!
Phoebe, Hey  does anybody want to join me in the aroma room? 
Rachel, All right!
Ross, I would!
Monica, Hey  guys  guys  did you see my new  china cabinet?!
Phoebe, Watch  watch. 
Phoebe, And  and! 
Chandler,  Hey  my Father’s house does that!
Rachel,  O-o-o-okay  how did it go? Tell me everything.
Chandler, Well  the movie was great  dinner was great  and there’s nothing like a cool  crisp New York evening.
Rachel, Hmm.
Chandler, Of course  I didn’t get to enjoy any of that  because Joanna’s such a big  dull dud!
Rachel, What?!
Rachel, Oh  I....
Rachel, Oh  I know...
Joey, Come on baby  don’t go. Please? What do you say?
Joey,  That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Joey, Hey  I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides  since ah  since when do you care who I’m going out with?
Joey, Do you want me to want you to care?
Joey, What?
Joey, Come on baby  don’t go. Please? What do you say?
Joey, Hey  it’s gonna be all right.
Joey, What?
Joey, Oh  yeah  with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah  y'know what  I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
Joey, Okay. 
Joey, Okay.
Joey,  Ah  are you okay?
Joey, I don’t know.
Joey, How do you mean?
Joey, Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  and then Adrian  she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
Joey, And then  then he could use his teeth  his teeth to undo her dress  and  and  and bite her!
Joey, Something like that?
Joey, Yeah.
Joey,  Hey.
Ross, Hi.
Joey,  Hey.
Ross, Hi.
Joey, Hey.
Ross, It’s a little early to be drinkin’.
Joey, No-no  things ah  finally happened with Kate.
Ross, Ohhhhh!
Monica, You’re kidding?! That’s great!
Joey, Oh  it was so amazing. After the  love making...
Monica, Oh my.
Joey, Yep. I just  I just watched her sleep for like hours  just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause  ‘cause her eyes keep going like this. 
Chandler,  I’m telling ya  Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was  ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
Rachel, Ohh  gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?
Chandler, That’s what you say at the end of a date.
Rachel, You can’t just say  ‘Nice to meet you  good night?’
Chandler, To her face? Look it’s the end of the date  I’m standing there  I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know  comes out. I can’t help it  it’s a compulsion.
Monica, Come on Rach  when a guy says he’s going to call  it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?
Rachel, Well  they always called.
Monica, Hmm  bite me.
Rachel, No. Sorry.
Rachel, Okay  okay. Umm  well ah  maybe he  maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Rachel, Well...
Rachel, No. I...
Rachel,  Call her! Call her now!
Chandler, Multiple  so many paper cuts.
Rachel, Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out  she’s gone crazy!
Chandler,  Oh  well give me the phone then.
Rachel, Come on  this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!
Chandler, Look  you can’t call somebody after this long just to say  ‘In case you didn’t notice  I don’t like you!’
Rachel, Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.
Chandler, Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel, I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it  and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And  I don’t care how hard it is for you  do not tell her that you will call her again!
Chandler, All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date  no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates  I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Rachel, That’s fine!
Chandler, That’s just a lot of big talk  y'know.
Rachel, I know.
Ross, Mon?
Monica,  I’m in the shower!
Ross, Oh  fire! There  there’s a fire! Fire!!
Joey, Hey.
Joey, So I ah  talked to Lauren  kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah  did you talk to Marshall?
Joey, Y'know  about what happened with us.
Joey, What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean  come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there  you’re not that good an actress.
Joey, Nooo.
Joey, Hi  Lauren.
Ross, Sorry I ah  I scared you in there.
Monica, Oh  that’s okay. By the way  I was just checking the shower massager.
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica,  I tried to reach you at work. There’s....been a fire.
Phoebe, What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
Ross, Well  we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
Phoebe, All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Monica, Well  the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.
Phoebe, Ohh. What is this? 
Ross, No Phoebe  don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!
Phoebe,  Ohh  the-the Foster puppets!
Chandler, It’s not a big deal. It’s  just it’s right here   and it’s all the time.
Chandler,  Yes  this  this was pleasant.
Chandler, The food there was  was great.
Chandler, So take care.
Chandler, Well  this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime. 
Rachel, Sophie’s desk.
Rachel,  Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler, Noo!
Rachel, Chandler!!
Chandler, Look  I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak  and pathetic  and sorry.
Rachel, Okay  you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now. 
Chandler, Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.
Chandler, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look  this has nothing to do with you  y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious  serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment  intimacy   mascara goop. And I’m really sorry  it’s just that this is not  this isn’t going to work out.
Chandler, Yeah  o-okay.
Chandler, Well this is great! I’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Joey,  Well  so anyway Beth  what I’m saying is I should’ve considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I’ve ah  I’ve recently learned what’s it like to be on your side of it  and I’m sorry. So  do you think you can forgive me?  Great. Thanks. Okay  bye.  Hello  Jennifer?  Oh hi  Mrs. Loreo  is Jennifer there?  Oh  she’s not home huh?  Well ah  actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Rachel, So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Monica, Oh  some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Phoebe, Oh my God  they took my idea!
Monica, That was you?!
Phoebe, Yeah! Okay  here you go. 
Phoebe, Oh my God  are you guys okay?
Joey,  Oh my.
Chandler,  Hey.
Joey, Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Chandler, Oh  so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay  listen  you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me  I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Joey, Hey I was crying because  because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Ross,  I’m gonna be on TV!!
Chandler, No way!
Ross, Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
Chandler, Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
Ross, Thanks. You ready to go?
Chandler, Yeah. 
Joey, Saw a girl with that vest.
Chandler, Thanks. 
Joey,  Yeah  hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I was watching this ah  commercial on TV and man  those guys are cute!
Monica, Hi! Hey  Pete you’re back! Hey  check this out. 
Monica, Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?
Monica, Oh  what’d ya bring me?!  Awww  hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh  these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Monica,  Regular or decaf?
Monica, Okay. 
Monica, So what did you do today Pete?
Monica, What?! Oh.
Monica, Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel, What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica, I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job  and God knows I paid my dues.  But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Rachel, And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
Monica, Hmm  no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Rachel, Yeah  but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
Monica, Oh  please.
Monica, What? Honey.
Rachel, Oh  I am  my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Monica, Oh God  I’m so sorry.
Rachel, I know.
Rachel, Ow!!
Monica, Oh God!
Ross,  Hey  you guys! Guess what?
Rachel,  Got a job on a river boat?
Ross, Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well  guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Rachel, Oh I see  so this suit is making a point.
Ross, Right.
Rachel, Now that you’re on you’re own  you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
Ross,  You like it right?
Monica, Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!
Rachel, Yeah  come here!
Monica, What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
Rachel, Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross, Okay  good bye! 
Chandler, So um  after you put the suggestion in the box  how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Phoebe, Umm  oh  about three months.
Chandler, Okay  so I guess that’s about ah  two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Joey,  Hey!!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Chandler, Okay.  It’s a chicken.
Joey, It’s cute  huh?
Phoebe, Whoa-whoa-whoa  you guys  do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler, Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe, Okay  well they are a huge responsibility  especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food  and lot’s and lot’s of love.
Joey, Oh  well no problem there. 
Chandler, Easy Lenny.
Monica, Okay. Here’s the thing.
Monica, I can’t do it. I’m sorry  I wish I could  but umm  see you have these feelings for me....
Monica, Huh?
Monica, Oh?
Monica, Oh  that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry  but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Monica, Oh my God! Oh  this is incredible! Ohh!  All right  y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Monica, Okay.  Can you give me a little push?
Monica,  I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
Phoebe,  Wow! That’s exciting  you went to Japan  made up a woman.
Phoebe, I’m just saying  this woman  I mean she’s fictitious. No?
Phoebe, ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you  so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together  maybe something might happen  and...
Phoebe, Yeah  no  I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
Phoebe, Absolutely  oh I promise. Tell her what?
Phoebe, No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive  but my memory sucks.
Chandler, Okay  but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here  and a chick-chick there. Here a chick  there a chick  everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, How’s she doing?
Chandler, She?
Joey, Well yeah  don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?

Joey, What?
Chandler, I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Joey, Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Chandler, You don’t think I get up when you get up?
Joey, Ohhh  here it comes.
Chandler, Yes  here it comes! I’m stuck here all day  and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
Joey, Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Chandler, And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey, That’s not what I said. Okay  I just meant...
Chandler, I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick  we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Joey, I don’t know  maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
Chandler, I’ll take her back tomorrow.
Joey, Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross,  Ohhh  hey! All right  listen  I-I have that TV thing in like two hours  and I need your help  okay? What do you think?  This blue suit  or this brown one?
Joey, Well  the brown one brings out your eyes  but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Ross, Really? 
Rachel,  Oww! 
Ross, Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Rachel,  Oww!
Ross, Oh my God  is that still...

Rachel, Well  I will go to the hospital tomorrow  it’ll still be broken then.

Ross, Rachel...
Rachel, Look  either help me or go.
Ross, Fine. I’ll go.
Rachel,  Okay  but before you go  could you help me first?

Rachel, Since when  since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
Ross, Well I  close your eyes  I just think you’re gonna like this a little better  ‘cause  close-close...

Monica, Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Phoebe, No.

Rachel, Yeah  but that was different. Y’know? I mean  we were  we were going out then  now I think it’s weird.

Phoebe, Noo!
Monica, Does it involve clogs?
Phoebe, Oh  wait  wait. Clogs  or claws?
Monica, Clogs.
Phoebe, No.
Monica, Claws?!
Phoebe, No.
Monica, Okay  so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But  what about Pete?
Phoebe,  No!
Monica, What is it?! What about Pete?

Phoebe, Oh  just go. You’re never gonna get it!
Chandler, I know. See  yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth  she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey,  Ohhh.  Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Chandler, I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter  and you know what I found out?
Chandler, If they can’t find a home for her  they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Joey, Okay  good  good  good  ‘cause  good  ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Chandler, Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
Joey, That’s horrible! Well  you did the right thing man.
Chandler, Thanks  I’m glad you see it that way.
Chandler, Ohhh-hoo  funny story!
Monica, I don’t believe this! Wow  look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold  but I’m always cold. Oh my God  look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Monica, Oh  it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. 
Monica, Did you just smell my hair?
Monica, Oh God.
Monica, You still have feelings for me don’t you?
Monica, Pete.
Monica, No  it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.
Monica, You may be okay about getting hurt  but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.
Monica, And well  we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.
Monica, Okay  bye.
Monica, All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.  Oh  wow! 
Rachel, Okay  you’d tell me the truth. Right?
Ross, Rach  you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
Rachel, Okay.

Rachel, What thing? What is this thing?
Ross, I was kinda  supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Ross  why didn’t you tell me that?
Ross, Eh  ‘cause I knew that if I told you  you’d make me go  and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Rachel, I cannot believe you.
Ross, What?
Rachel, That is the sweetest thing  I just....
Ross,  You should get some sleep.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, So  I’ll umm...
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.

Phoebe, Oh  yeah  that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
Rachel, Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!
Phoebe, No! Rachel  that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow  if I don’t get through  they’re not gonna fix my crappy  broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!

Phoebe, Like a date type  person?
Ross, Yeah  kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it  Rach?

Rachel, You don’t?!
Ross, No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Rachel, Umm  or  maybe  I should stay away from all men.
Ross, No  it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous.  I mean I’m not  I’m not  I’m not jealous  okay? It’s… Look  the guy  he screamed  he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.

Joey,  In a minute!!
Joey, Yeah  I guess it is.  Listen  I ah  I gotta say good bye  and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know  is that I will never forget you. But  you’ve got things you have to do now  and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship   and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return  200 years from now  you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up  because Adrienne  baby  I’m gonna want to meet her.
Monica, Phoebe  it’s been two days.

Ross, Phoebe  800 is toll free  801 is-is Utah.
Phoebe, No  no  no  oh no-no-no  it’s has to be 800.  ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers  every one.  Yeah  every big Utah-based company has one.
Rachel, Phoe-be!!
Phoebe, Sorry  I’m so sorry  I will pay you back.
Chandler, And yet  she’s still not hanging up the phone.
Phoebe, Fine! Fine!  Oh-oh!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Well  I think I broke it. But that’s all right  here’s the number you can call.
Monica,  Oh.
Joey, Hey  wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.
Chandler, Or... Dick.
Ross,  Hey.
Ross, Listen  I-I need a favor. Umm  I was in the shower  and as I was cleansing myself  I ah  I-I  well I felt something.
Chandler, Was it like a sneeze only better?
Ross, No  no  I mean  I mean a thing on my body.
Joey,  What was it?
Ross, Well  I don't know  it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me  and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. 
Chandler, No!!
Ross, Come on you guys  it's no big deal! 
Chandler, Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh.
Ross, Well what is it? Is it a mole? 
Joey, No  it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Ross, Well  eww. What? Is it a pimple?
Chandler, No  it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross  why don't you just go see a…
Rachel,  Hey guys! What's... 
Chandler, Okay  well  it's definite  two more weeks of winter.
Ross, Ahhh.
Joey, Yeah  right.
Phoebe,  Okay  and then this is the coffee house. This is where I play my music. 
Phoebe, Yeah  and these are my friends. People. This is Vince  Vince the people.
Rachel, Hi!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Vince is a fireman.
Rachel, Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Chandler, Well  y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
Chandler, You're right  I know.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Rachel, Wow  he's cute  Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Phoebe, Oh  Jason? Yeah  uh-huh  we're seeing each other tonight.
Rachel, What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
Phoebe, I know  I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like  juggling two guys  I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know  this kind've like y'know oat-sowin'  field-playin' juggler.
Joey, So Pheebs  do they know about each other?
Phoebe, Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay  no they don't.
Ross,  Hey guys!
Joey, Hey.
Rachel, Hi!
Joey,  Well?!
Chandler,  Okay  how'd it go at the doctor's?
Ross, Well  he said there's definitely nothing to worry about  it's totally benign.
Joey, Well what is it?!
Ross, He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said  he said  without being able to identify it  he was reluctant to remove it.
Chandler, Y'know what? You should go to my guy  because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
Ross, At least they knew what yours was. Y'know  yours had a name.
Joey," Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know  they'll call it  The Ross. And then people would be like  ""Awww  he's got a Ross."""
Ross,  Yeah  that'd be cool!
Monica, Pete's breaking up with me.
Monica, I just checked my messages  and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta  we need to talk.
Rachel, And?
Monica, Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
Joey, Whoa  that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Monica, Really?!
Joey, Yeah  maybe he just cheated on you.
Phoebe, That is so great! Oh  I...  Oh my God!
Phoebe,  Oh my God!!!
Phoebe,  No! No!
Phoebe, Well  we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman  we'd  we'd like a good mechanic.  Oh my God  here they come! Well  we gotta get out of here!
Phoebe, Well look  if I wanted to see a fireman  I would date one. Okay? 
Ross, Th-th-that's all it is  a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
Ross, Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Ross, No?
Ross, Well then  what is it?!
Monica,  I gotta go water Pete's plants.  Y'know what  if he's gonna break up with me  maybe I won't water his plants.
Chandler, Well  if he's gonna break up with you  maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Joey, Or ha-ha  we could go over there and pee on them.
Phoebe,  …and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just  always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
Rachel, Well honey  then why don't you break up with one of them?
Phoebe,  Uh.
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah  what happened to playing the field?
Phoebe, Well  it just  it doesn't feel like playing anymore  it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
Rachel, So Pheebs  pick one of them.
Monica, Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Phoebe, Well  Vince is great  y'know `cause  he's like a guy  guy. Y'know? He's so burly  he's sooo very burly. 
Joey, Okay  good  so there you go. Go with Vince.
Phoebe, Yeah  but Jason's really sensitive.
Chandler, Well sensitive is important  pick him.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Joey, Oh sure  go with the sissy.
Phoebe, Jason is not a sissy!
Joey, Oh no-no-no-no  I meant Chandler.
Ross, Y'know I have dinner plans!!
Monica, Okay  this is the den. All right  check this out. Lights!  Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away!  Oh  see you just need to find the right command.
Ross, Yes  and the dimmer switch.
Joey, Whoa! For a rich guy he's got  that's a pretty small TV.
Monica, No-no-no  that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here  so please  do not touch anything.
Chandler,  I-kea! This is comfortable.
Rachel,  This place is amazing.
Phoebe, God  that is the nicest kitchen.
Monica, I know.
Phoebe, No! But it's the nicest kitchen  the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Joey, Look at this! A millionaire's checkbook.
Monica, Joey  put that down!  Oh my God! It's Pete. Okay  get out!! How the hell do you answer a video-phone! 
Monica, I guess that's how.
Monica, Oh it’s umm  good! It's umm  it’s good  just here watering the plants.
Rachel,  Ahh... Chandler's on the couch!!
Joey, Hi  how ya doing?
Monica, Ahh  Pete  the other day when you said you needed to talk  umm  just so I know  is it good news or bad news.
Monica, Oh no-no-no  it's still me.
Monica, Oh  oh  okay umm  so I'll see you soon.
Monica, I love you.
Monica, Okay. Well  it's good news. It's good news.
Chandler, So  what do you thing the good news is?
Joey,  Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50 000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design.  Oh  sorry  what do you think the good news is?
Monica, Oh my.
Rachel, Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Ross, Hey  you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
Monica, And that's Pete's Mom.
Rachel, Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding  and the theme could be  “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know  I mean you could put  you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah  you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry  but people will like it.
Monica, Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks  I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.
Chandler, Yes  but this is Pete. Okay? He’s not like other people  on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
Monica, Well if-if that’s what it is  then it’s-it’s crazy.
Ross, Monica’s right. We’re talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can’t just rush into this.
Rachel, Oh please  what do you know! You married a lesbian!
Phoebe, All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Chandler, Oh  so you’re going with the teacher  huh?
Phoebe, Yeah  I like Vince a lot  y'know? But  it’s just Jason’s so sensitive  y'know? And in the long run  I think sensitive it’s just better than having just like a really  really  really nice  butt.   Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay  wish me luck!
Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!  Sorry  I was just imagining what it’d be like to catch the money bouquet.
Phoebe, Excuse me. Umm  is Vince here?
Phoebe, Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.
Phoebe, Umm  wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm  I don’t think we should see each other anymore.
Phoebe, I’m sorry.
Phoebe, Oh my God  I didn’t…
Phoebe,  Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Phoebe,  I’m telling you  if you want to take care of that thing  you should go to my herbal guy.
Ross, Thank you  but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.
Monica, Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body  they tell their friends about it.
Ross, Gimme this. 
Rachel,  Hi! Okay  don’t be mad at me  but I couldn’t resist.
Monica, Brides magazines?
Rachel, Yes  and I know that you’d say no if he asked you  but I’m sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin. 
Phoebe,  Oh  you so would! Oh  you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
Monica, It is so weird  I know what I said  but uh  this morning  I was lying in bed I was  I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  I know it’s a little sudden  and it’s a little rushed  and it’s totally not like me to do something like this  but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete  and I know that we want the same things  and when I thought about saying yes  it made me really happy.
Rachel, Oh my God. 
Monica, I know.  I need more pie. 
Phoebe, Hey Mon umm  if you do get married  can I bring two guests?
Rachel, You didn’t break up with that fireman?
Phoebe, No  that was my way of telling you. Well  it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive  he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Rachel, Wow!
Phoebe, Yeah  well he’d prefer water colors  but y'know  he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Monica, So then  are you going to dump Jason?
Phoebe, Well  yeah  because I have to break up with someone  and… Okay so Jason is sensitive   but now so’s Vince  Plus  Vince has the body y'know?  So… It’s really just about the math.
Phoebe,  Jason?
Phoebe, Nah-ha!
Ross, Hi.
Ross, Listen  I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before  so...
Ross, What’s a koondis?
Ross, I guess it’s worth a try.
Ross, What?! What?!

Monica, Oh  right! I completely forgot about that.
Monica, Yeah?
Monica, Wow.
Monica, What’s that?
Monica, Okay. 
Monica, You wanna what?!
Monica, What are you talking about?
Monica, And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Monica, My parents will be so happy.
Phoebe,  “Crazy underwear  creepin’ up my butt.  Crazy underwear  always in a rut. Crazy under--wear…”  Oh No! What is he doing here? All right  just keep playing  just keep playing. You’ll get through this; you’ll be fine.   Okay  thank you. And  as always no one talk to me after the show.
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, I don’t know  he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him  Vince!
Phoebe, Yeah  okay  I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you  and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun  for me. Umm  but I-I like you both  and I  and I didn’t know how to chose  so... I’m sorry  I’m just  I’m terrible  I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.
Phoebe, Really?!
Phoebe, Well  this is none of my business. 
Phoebe, Well  I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
Phoebe,  Well  that could’ve been really awkward.
Phoebe, Yeah  but I-I-I-I can do that for you  I’m gonna do that for you.
Chandler,  Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay  Dick?
Joey, Yeah  yeah. He’s got a  he’s got a really bad cough  and our vet  he can’t do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
Chandler, Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah  as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign  and it says “You’re in Sample.” 
Monica,  Hey.
Rachel, How’d it go with Pete?!
Joey, Tell us!
Monica, You’re not gonna believe this. Okay  so I go over...
Monica, So guys  listen  I go over there  and umm...
Phoebe, All right  so  so you went to Pete’s...
Ross, What happened?
Monica,  I...
Monica, Forget it. 
Joey,  So you’re the gynaecologist?
Phoebe, So Monica  what were you gonna tell us?
Monica,  I have no idea.
Rachel, So  come on  what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
Phoebe, No-no-no oh  keep your name  don’t take his name.
Monica, He didn’t ask me to marry him.
Phoebe, Well then definately don’t take his name.
Monica, He wanted to tell me he’s gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
Rachel, Why?! What is it?
Monica, I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.
Phoebe,  Oh?!
Monica, Yeah  but without the costumes.
Phoebe,  Oh.
Joey, And it’s not fake  it’s totally brutal.
Chandler, Yeah  it’s two guys in a ring  and the rules are: “They’re are no rules.”
Monica, So you can like  bite  and pull people’s hair and stuff?
Ross, Yeah  anything goes  except ah  eye gouging and fish hooking.
Monica, What’s fish hooking?
Ross, Huh  what’s fish hooking...   Thanks man  that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
Joey, What? My hands are totally clean  I just gave the duck a bath.
Chandler, Yes  but there’s two in martini  soo everybody back to my office.
Chandler, Oh it’s Bing  sir. I’m sorry   I was just ah...
Ross,  That’s right  Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six.  Thank you.   Yeah  we have the reservations.
Rachel, Yes!!
Chandler, All right buddy  way to go! 
Ross,  Dude  what are you doing?
Chandler, Thank you! Today  my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Phoebe, Yeesh  what’d you do about it?
Chandler, Well  I didn’t do anything. I didn’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Monica, I gotta tell ya  I think it’s okay to be that guy.
Joey, Yeah  maybe it’s like y'know  that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns. 
Rachel, Y'know I don’t  I don’t understand guys  I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know  grabbin’ her boob.
Chandler, Yeah  I know  for a really great stew you just y'know  stick your head in between ‘em.
Monica, Okay  can we please go eat?
Joey, Yeah. What are we getting?
Monica,  Anything but stew.
Ross, All right so  Chandler  from now on  don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah  don’t turn your back to him.
Joey, Yeah  or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt  all right? Then  when he goes to smack ya  his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
Chandler,  What if Joey were president?
Phoebe, Umm  hey Rach  can I ask you something?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Okay  you can totally say no  but umm  would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
Rachel, Oh  ah with who?
Phoebe, Umm  my friend  Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute  and now that you two aren’t together  she asked if I could set it up  but if you’re not cool with it...
Rachel, Oh-oh-oh  which one is Bonnie again?
Phoebe, You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah  like  average height  medium build  bald...
Rachel, Oh!  That’s fine.
Phoebe, Great! Okay  good for you! 
Monica,  Hi!
Monica, Hey  umm  so listen umm  my friends were telling me a little about this ah  ultimate fighting thing and it  well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt  ‘cause I kinda like you.
Monica, Promise me you’ll be careful.
Monica, Hey  are we still on for tonight?
Monica, Okay  good  ‘cause umm  well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
Monica, How ‘bout just a boom?
Rachel,  Well that was depressing  I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
Phoebe, Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie. 
Rachel, This is Bonnie?  This is Bonnie?  You’re Bonnie?
Rachel, Oh no  I’m sorry  you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
Rachel, Oh  that must be it.
Phoebe,  Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Rachel,  You said she was bald.
Phoebe, Yeah  she was bald  she’s not now.
Rachel, How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Phoebe, I don’t know  I hardly ever say that about people.
Rachel,  Ohh  well  this is just perfect!
Phoebe, Well I’m sorry  I thought you said it was okay.
Rachel, Yeah  I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean  y'know  that girl has hair got all over head!
Phoebe, Well  maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
Rachel, Why  does she have a bad personality?
Phoebe, Oh no  Bonnie’s the best!
Chandler,  What is with him?
Chandler, Well  that’s not true  he-he smacked you once.
Chandler, No sir.
Ross,  Hey!
Monica, God Ross  what is that?
Ross, Yeah  it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah  I saved thirty cents  plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
Monica, I love you  Pete!!!
Monica,  Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!
Ross, Well  then that guy is in serious  serious trouble.
Ross, All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
Monica, Hey!  It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Monica, I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first  but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
Monica, Well  you’re not gonna get going are you?
Monica, Well  no. But...
Monica, That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Monica, You didn’t know that already?
Monica, Okay  just get a lot better.  Fast.
Monica, Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Monica,  Hey.
Ross, Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
Monica, Oh  about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Ross, Hot dog?
Monica, Four  please.  I’m really nervous.  Thank you. 
Phoebe, So Ross  how umm  how did it go with Bonnie?
Ross, What? Oh! I gotta tell you  I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all  I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now  but she’s really terrific.
Phoebe, Ohh  that’s too bad!
Ross, No  I-I’m saying I liked her.
Phoebe, Yeah  y'know what  there are other fish in the sea.
Ross, Pheebs  I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.
Phoebe, Okay  I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Chandler,  Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
Ross, Ahh  the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Joey,  Hey  the fight’s starting!
Ross, Okay  we’ll be right in.  So ah  did your boss try to slap you again today?
Chandler, Nine times! Okay  I had to put on lotion! But  it’s gonna be okay  because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment  and if all goes as planned  my butt will be smack free.
Joey,  Fight’s over!
Chandler, Excuse me  Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!
Chandler, No  I ah  I didn’t do them.
Chandler, No  no I just ah  didn’t do them. Instead  I ah  hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise  verbal or otherwise.
Chandler, Doug!!
Chandler, I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Chandler, No  no. It-it’s not about the swearing  it’s more about ah  the way  that you ah  occasionally  concentrate  your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Chandler, Oh  and don’t get me wrong  I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I  I have a rather  sensitive posterior  and ah  besides  it’s making all the other guys jealous.
Chandler, Okay. 
Chandler, Ahhhhh! 
Phoebe, Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant  or inside his shower drain?
Rachel,  Oh my God! Phoebe look  it’s Ross and that girl.
Phoebe, No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!
Rachel, Phoebe! 
Phoebe,  Right  oh yeah. Wow  oh  it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff  I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.
Rachel, Come on Phoebe  look at that! They are not breaking up  look at them. Okay that’s  you know what that is? That is a  that is a second date  that’s what that is! Look at that  she just put her hand on his thigh...
Phoebe, Oh no! That really is nothing  she is very sexually aggressive.
Rachel, Ohh!  Phoebe  this is all your fault! Now he loves her  he’s gonna marry her  and this is all your fault.
Phoebe, You said it was okay!
Rachel, You said she was bald!!
Phoebe, What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Rachel, Phoebe  we can’t  we just can’t just let it happen! Okay  we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like  shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Phoebe, Okay  first of all  breathe. Second of all  I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?
Rachel,  Yes.
Phoebe, Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?
Rachel, Yes.
Phoebe, So?
Rachel, I just y'know  I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh! 
Phoebe,  Oh no.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Oh  we killed them all.
Rachel, Oh!
Monica, Please tell me you’re stopping now.
Monica, You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Monica, Sit down. All right? Please  just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Monica, Well then  y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this  then you’re gonna have to do it without me.
Monica, Then I’ve gotta go. Bye. 
Monica, Yes?
Chandler, Thank you  sir.
Chandler, No. No  not at all  that’s-that’s ridiculous.
Chandler, Ye-ye-yeah  yes I do!
Chandler, Run! Run you crazy  rich freak!
Rachel, Oh  I can’t watch this. 
Joey, Check it out  he’s winning!  Pete’s winning!
Monica, Really?!
Joey, No-o-o!!
Phoebe, Wait  if that’s his favourite area  why is he being so mean to it?
Ross, Well  this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends  Richard didn’t want to have kids  and from the looks of it  now Pete can’t.
Chandler,  So ah  your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Chandler, Tell it again.  Seriously.
Rachel,  I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey, Yeah  sure. Well y'know  earlier she was talking about geography.
Monica, Joey  she was listing the countries she’s done it in.
Joey, Well  I think we all learned something.
Phoebe,  Hey  you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.
Chandler,  Me and Frank and Phoebe  Graduation 1965.
Phoebe, Y'know what that means?
Joey, That you’re actually 50?
Phoebe, No-no  that’s not  that’s not me Phoebe  that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook  they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.
Rachel, That is so cool.
Phoebe, I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents  and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up  and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Ross, That’s too bad.
Rachel,  Ohh  big  fat bummerrr.
Phoebe, So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
Joey, Hey  Bonnie had sex there!
Monica,  Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Chandler, You’re not gonna die an old maid  maybe an old spinster cook.
Monica,  Thanks!
Chandler, Hey now besides  if worst comes to worst  I’ll be your boyfriend.
Monica, Yeah right.
Chandler, Why is that so funny?
Monica, You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Chandler, Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah  boyfriend material?
Monica, Well  no. You’re Chandler. Y'know  Chandler! 
Chandler, Okay  so we’ve established my name  and hit me. But theoretically y'know  I mean say we weren’t friends  say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door  and I’m like  “Hey  nice to meet  ya. Hey  oh-hey.”
Monica, Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Joey,  Hey!
Monica, Oh  hey! Oh good  you brought food!
Joey, No  it’s just my luggage.
Joey, Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Phoebe, Oh  I am having the best karma this week. First  I find this woman who knew my parents  and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Ross, Yeah? What about ah  that bike messenger you hit?
Phoebe, Oh  I wasn’t talking about his karma.
Rachel,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey-hey  check out the hat!
Chandler, What a minute  I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!
Monica, Seriously  where did you get the hat?
Rachel, Ross gave it to me.
Ross, Yeah  I think she looks good.
Rachel, Ohh  thank you.
Chandler, Buy it for ya  or win it for ya?
Rachel, Well excuse me  my fashion-impaired friends  I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Phoebe, And this time  they’ve ganged up to form one giant  super hat.
Ross, Go  go  go!
Rachel, Oh yeah  now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Phoebe, Oy!!
Monica, What’s with all this sand? 
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  Bob said there might be flood damage.
Ross, Yeah  either that  or he has a really big cat.
Phoebe,  Knock  knock  knock.
Phoebe,  Are you ah  Phoebe Abott?
Phoebe, Hi Phoebe Abott  I’m your best friends daughter!
Phoebe, No  I-I mean your-your old best friend  here.  Lily  from high school. Remember?
Phoebe,  Phoebe.  Phoebe. Phoebe  yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Phoebe, Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad  that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy.
Phoebe, No-no  sorry. Cookies are good  thanks.
Phoebe,  Well  so  umm  anyway umm  I’ve been  I’ve been looking for my Father  and umm  have you heard from him  or seen him?
Phoebe,  Oh  okay. Well  so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.

Monica,  So what’s Phoebe like?
Phoebe, I’m kind  caring  and sweet. What’s Monica like?
Monica, Ah no  the other Phoebe  the one you went to go see.
Phoebe, Ohh  I think she knows where my Dad is.
Joey, What?
Rachel, Really?!
Monica, Oh well  where is he?!
Phoebe, She was acting  she was pretending like she hasn’t heard from him on years  but I found this picture on her fridge  and look ! Isn’t this what he would look like now?
Monica,  Totally familiar. 
Rachel, Oh  yeah.
Monica, Well  why would she lie to you?
Phoebe, I don’t know  but we’re having dinner tomorrow night  so I figured  she’s gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to  buy me presents  I don’t know! So  you’re all bored?
Chandler, Yes!
Phoebe, All right  I’m gonna close my eyes and point to someone  and you  whoever I point has to come up with something fun for us to do  and we have to do it.
Joey, Okay  all right.

Ross, Okay   Fonzy gives you two thumbs up  collect two cool points. Yeah.
Phoebe, Monica  if you get five cool points  you get to make somebody take off one item of clothing. It hasn’t happened yet  but we’re all very excited.

Chandler, I don’t know.
Rachel,  Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Phoebe, Shhh! Shhhh! Joey’s asleep.
Phoebe, After he passed out  we put the sand around him to keep him warm.
Rachel, Well I assume the ah  happy couple isn’t up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?
Chandler, Oh  yeah  I don’t know what they were doing  but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.

Monica, Like a log.
Rachel, I’m going for a walk.
Ross,  Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.

Joey, What?!
Phoebe, Yeah  she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding me  she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows  and she won’t tell me.
Rachel, Aww Pheebs  that sucks!
Phoebe, Yeah  well  don’t “Aww Pheebs  that sucks!” me yet. 
Chandler, Where ya going?
Phoebe, Well  she’s out of town so  there’s gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Ross, Uh  Pheebs  some people call that breaking and entering.
Phoebe, Well  are any of those people here?!
Phoebe, Okay  look I-I-I do something nice  okay? I’ll-I’ll fill her ice trays.
Ross, Wh-haa-haa! Look what ‘cha did!

Ross, You don’t know?! Rach  you balded my girlfriend!
Rachel, All right! Ross  do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Ross, Y'know  hey! You’re the one who ended it  remember?

Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Heh?
Joey, I’m telling ya  you guys are totally getting back together!
Ross, That’s not true! Her  she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
Chandler, Okay  then you gotta back away  all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......
Ross, I know  but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Chandler, Ahhhh! 
Chandler, Oh  ahh  no thanks  I just had an M&M.
Ross, Good night.
Ross, Okey-dokey!
Chandler, There is not one hair on that head.
Ross, Hey  it’ll grow back  right? And she-she’s really fun  and she’s cool  and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so   y'know? Y'know  and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there  and-and I kiss her  and  Gooood I wanna kiss her  and-and-and it doesn’t work out  right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Joey, So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight  you’re doing the smart  healthy thing and moving on.
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, Right  and you go with Rachel  Bonnie’s free tonight?
Ross,  Hi. 
Chandler,  Hi there.
Monica, That’s that weird voice again.
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Let me try it again  you’re gonna wanna date this next guy  I swear!
Chandler, Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating  that’s good stuff!!
Joey,  Okay  so we went to the beach  because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad  and I don’t really know what happened with that.
Phoebe, Ehh?
Joey,  Oh  and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...
Chandler,   Hi there. 
Joey,  ...and he couldn’t let it go  and... I don’t really know what happened with that either.
Joey,  Oh-oh! And then Ross’s new girlfriend  Bonnie  shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss  and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don’t know what happened there either...
Joey, Y'know what  hold on  let me go get Chandler. 
Ross,  Hi!
Ross, Awww.
Rachel, Oh  you’re welcome a million.
Ross, Yeah. 
Rachel,  Oh my God.
Ross, I know.
Ross,  Okay  I gotta go.
Rachel, Whoa! What?! Why?!
Ross, Well  I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.
Rachel, Here?! Now?!
Ross, Well  yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night  and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.
Rachel, Well  can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?
Ross, No  she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either  I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Rachel,  Whoa-ho.
Ross, Whoa-oh  okay! Yeah  why am I telling you that?
Rachel, I don’t know.
Ross, Yeah  yeah.  It wasn’t every morning.
Rachel, Oh  making it worse!
Ross, Okay.
Phoebe, I-I mean I  well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born  and everyone started lying their asses off!
Phoebe, How close?
Phoebe, I don’t even know how that would work!
Phoebe,  I’m not asking!
Phoebe, Yeah. Let’s see  my had Mom killed herself  and my Dad had run off  and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Phoebe, Yeah  well  everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out  but you didn’t even try! Y'know what  you walked out on me  and I’m just  I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
Phoebe, I don’t ever want to see you again!
Phoebe,  Umm  where’s my purse?
Monica,  Shoot! We’re out of soda.
Chandler,  Oh  I’ll go out and get you some.
Monica, Really?!
Chandler, Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs  how did it go?
Phoebe, Well  umm  my Mom’s friend  Phoebe  is actually my birth Mom.
Chandler, I found a dried up seashores.
Monica, Sweety  what are you talking about?
Phoebe, Oh  my new Mom  who-who’s a big  fat abandoner! 
Joey, Whoa  wait  Pheebs  wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Phoebe, No. I’m just  I wanna  I need to be alone.
Phoebe,  Monica!
Monica, Oh.
Ross, It’s over.
Rachel, Oh  was it awful?
Ross, Well  it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was  until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head.  Anyway  she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
Rachel, I wrote you a letter.
Ross, Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. 
Rachel,  It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us  and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together  I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Ross, Okay.  Wow  it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning.  So  I’d better get cracking on this baby.
Rachel, Well  I’ll be waiting for you  just come up when you’re done.
Ross, Okay  I’ll be up in   18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
Ross, Oh.  Oh-oh. 
Rachel,  Hey!  What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
Ross, Done!
Rachel, You just finished?
Ross, Well  I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very  very important to you  to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully  twice!
Rachel, So umm  does it?
Ross, I’m sorry.
Rachel, Does it?
Ross, Does it? Does it? Yeah  I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.
Rachel, What are you talking about  Ross  you just said that you read it twice! Look  y'know what  either it does or it doesn’t  and if you have to even think about it...
Ross,  No  Rach  no. I don’t  I don’t  I don’t have to think about it  in fact  I’ve decided  I’ve decided that  that it.......does.
Rachel, Are you sure?
Ross, Oh  sure! I’m sure.
Rachel, I know. 
Chandler, All right  there’s a nuclear holocaust  I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Monica, Ennnh.
Chandler, I’ve got canned goods.
Joey,  Hey  you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out  dug me a hole!
Chandler, Excellent hole  Joe.
Joey, Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Monica,  Ow!! Ow!!!
Joey,  What?! What?!! What is it?!
Monica, Jellyfish sting! Oh  it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Chandler, Well  can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Monica, It’s like two miles!
Joey, Yeah  and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.
Monica, Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
Chandler, We’ve got to do something!
Joey, Well  there’s really only one thing you can do.
Monica, What?! What is it?!
Joey, You’re gonna have to pee on it.
Monica, What?!! Gross!!
Joey, Don’t blame me  I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Chandler, Y'know what  he’s right. There’s something like uh  ammonia in that  that like kills the pain.
Monica, Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that  baaad!!!!
Joey, If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Phoebe, Well  I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  Oh. Are you? Are you?!!  Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh  not for Bonnie.  But for you  yay! Ohh.
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, How was the beach?
Monica, Nothing  I don’t know.
Ross, What happened?
Monica, Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.
Chandler, Me too!!
Joey, Me too.
Phoebe, Okay  I’m gonna put this  in the car.
Rachel, Ooh  I have to go pack.  It really does?
Ross, It does. It really and truly does.
Ross,   It so does not!!!
Ross, She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about  about how I was unfaithful to her!   WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!
Chandler, Oh my God! If you say that one more time  I’m gonna break up with you!
Ross, Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault  and she  she says here   “If you accept full responsibility...”  Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!”
Joey, No?
Chandler, Look  Ross  you have what you want  you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Ross,  Yeah  I know. I mean  no  you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Joey, Sure  it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never   ever talk about.
Ross, What the hell happened on that beach?!
Joey, It’s between us and the sea  Ross!
Phoebe,  Hi  Ursula.
Phoebe, Okay  well umm  I know that we haven’t talked in a long time  but umm okay  our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Phoebe,  You know her?!
Phoebe, There-there was a suicide note?!  Well  do you still have it?
Phoebe, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!
Phoebe, I  umm  shut up!
Phoebe,  “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!
Phoebe, Noooo!!
Monica, Pass the cheese  please.
Monica, My God  you can’t even look at me! Can you?
Joey, Nope.
Chandler,  Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
Phoebe, No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
Chandler, I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
Ross,  Hey  you guys! What do you  what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
Rachel, All right  that’s it  you guys! What happened out there?
Monica, What? We took a walk  nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.
Ross, What happened? Joey?
Joey, All right. 
Monica,  No! Joey  we swore we’d never tell!
Chandler,  They’ll never understand!
Joey, Well  we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
Monica,  All right!! All right.  I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.
Chandler,  We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. 
Monica, I was in too much pain.
Joey, And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
Chandler, And then Joey remembered something.
Joey, I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross, Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel  yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Monica, You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried  but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... 
Joey, That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too  I’d pee on anyone of you! Only  uhh  I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help  but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh  I turned to Chandler.
Chandler,  Joey kept screaming at me  “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
Joey,  That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Phoebe,  “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.”  Thank you  thank you. Ohh  and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom.  Except for you. You go away.
Phoebe, Okay  bye.
Phoebe, No.
Phoebe, But  it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?
Phoebe, It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Phoebe, I-I like pizza!
Phoebe, Oh my God  so do I!
Phoebe, Wait-wait-wait  wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Phoebe, Uh-huh  well! But umm  still I’m-I’m mad at you.
Phoebe, Well umm  do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.
Phoebe, All right  stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.
Rachel, Oh-hooo  I missed you.
Ross, I missed you too.
Rachel, Ooh  I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything  it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?
Ross,  I suppose.
Rachel, You have! Ross  you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all  “Once a cheater  always a cheater.”
Ross,  Umm-hmm.
Rachel, Ooh  I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months  but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Ross,  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Chandler,   Coffee house?
Monica, You bet.
Ross, And for the record  it took two people to break up this relationship!!
Rachel, Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place  which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Ross, I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Rachel, What?!!
Ross, I fell asleep!
Rachel, You fell asleep?!
Ross, It was 5:30 in the morning  and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!   Oh-oh-oh  and by the way  Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are ’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Rachel, Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross,  FINE BY ME!! 
Rachel, Oh  oh  and hey-hey-hey  those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Monica, Hey!!
Rachel,  Sorry!!  I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Ross, Oh  no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!
Rachel, And hey! Just so you know  it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica,  Gin.
Chandler, We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple  we could play this game naked.
Monica, Will you stop!
Chandler, Okay. All right.
Monica, Okay  all right  I think you’re great  I think you’re sweet  and you’re smart  and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Chandler, Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Joey, How many times do I have to tell you! Ya  turn and sliiiide! Y'know  turn and slide.
Chandler, You don’t turn and slide  you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Joey, Look  we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
Chandler, All right  how about we  how ‘bout we sell it.
Joey, All right. But  you’re gonna have to tell them. 
Chandler,  Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet?  They seem all right with it!
Monica, Yesss!!
Ross, Who’s Chip?
Monica, Shhh!
Monica, Chip  is Chip Matthews.
Ross, The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Monica, ‘Cause I ran into him at the bank  he is still soo cute.
Ross, Monica  you’re so lucky! He’s like the most popular guy in school!!
Monica, I know!!   Chip? Hi! It’s Monica.  ‘Kay.  ‘Kay.  Okay.  Okay  good-bye.  Oh my God  we just had the best conversation!! 
Ross,  I was just leaving.
Rachel, Good! ‘Cause I’ve got a product report to read  it’s like eight pages  I hope I don’t fall asleep.
Ross, Why? Did you write it?
Rachel,  Wow! Look at that  Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
Ross, Well ah  actually...
Rachel,  I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Ross, Well  umm  why don’t you give him a call?
Rachel, Okay.  Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Ross, Oh  I’m sure.
Rachel,  Chip! Hi  it’s Rachel.  Rachel Green. Yeah  umm  you left me a message.  Yes you did  my roommate wrote it down.  Monica Geller.  Ohh.
Ross,  Oh  that’s right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that’s gotta be embarrassing!
Phoebe,  ...DUMB  DRUNKEN  BITCH!!!   Thank you  thanks.
Ross,  Hey  here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Chandler, Uh-huh  first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
Ross, I’m reading your ad.
Joey, Looks good  uh?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler,  Stunning entertainment center. Fine   fine Italian craftsmanship. 
Phoebe, Oh my God  you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Rachel, Why? I love that thing.
Chandler, You want it?
Chandler, Ahh  Gepeto  $5 000 dollars? Are you insane?
Joey, Hey  the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
Chandler, All right look  I’m changing it to 50 bucks  or your best offer.
Joey, What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
Chandler,  Nooo.
Joey, Oh. What do you do?
Chandler, I can’t believe you don’t know what I do for a living!
Phoebe, Yeah  I actually don’t know...
Ross, Good  so do I
Rachel, Something to do with numbers?
Phoebe, Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on  you!  Come on. Crazy.  Oh my God.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Nothing. Nothing.
Joey, What? What’s wrong?
Phoebe, I just  I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
Rachel, You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
Phoebe, No  no-no  she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily  the one who killed herself.
Ross, Are you sure she’s in the cat  or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
Phoebe, No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all  okay  there’s the feeling.  Okay  and for another  how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi  Mommy.  Oh  I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!
Joey,  Dude  Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...
Chandler,  Let it go!!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, Umm  when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
Monica, Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel, Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica, What  that little thing at the prom?
Rachel, Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Monica, Come on  that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
Rachel, I mean why  of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Monica, Look  you and I went to different high schools...
Rachel, Okay  that doesn’t help me  because we went to the same high school.
Monica, You went to one where you were popular  and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle  and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
Rachel,  They had to have that specially made?!
Monica, It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel,  Oh my God  they told us that was for the mascot!
Monica, Back then  I thought that I would never  ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews  and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
Rachel, Oh  you go out with him. 
Monica, Oh  really?!
Rachel, Yeah. Just  if it’s possible  could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Monica, I’ll try.
Ross, So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey, Well  there were a couple of calls last night  but ah  I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.
Chandler, Yes  Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently  not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Phoebe,  Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming  trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
Ross, So Pheebs  how long is your mom gonna be with us?
Phoebe, Well  I’m not sure. I mean  I guess until she y'know  gets used to the fact that there’s y'know  a new mom. Y'know  I think she’s worried that y'know  she’s gonna  she’s gonna be replaced.  Well  that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo.  Okay  I have to return a call in the other room.
Monica, Why can’t you use the phone in here?
Phoebe, Well  I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. 
Ross, So  guys  am I crazy  or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?
Monica, Ross  don’t start.
Ross, Come on  you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!
Rachel, I believe it.
Ross, No you don’t.
Rachel, Yes  I do.
Ross, No you do—y'know what  you’re not gonna suck me into this.
Rachel, Oh sure I am  because you always have to be right.
Ross, I do not always have to be—okay  okay. 
Rachel, Jurassic Park could happen.
Joey, Pretty nice?
Chandler, You’ll have to pardon my roommate  he wanted to marry this.
Chandler, Y'know  I  I really don’t think we need a canoe.
Chandler, All right  just  just take the entertainment center  and then when you get home  throw the canoe away!
Joey,  Good for you!!
Rachel,  You guys  you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!  Look kinda familiar?
Ross,  Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
Rachel, You guys  there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean  you know what that means?!
Joey,  Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward  split five ways!!
Rachel, Do we have to tell her?
Ross, Yes  we have to tell her!
Monica, Oh  but it’s made her so happy.
Ross,  Little girl misses her cat.  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.  Okay  y'know what  I have to go have dinner with my son  can I trust that when you see Phoebe  you will tell her.
Ross, Thank you.
Rachel, I hate when Ross is right!
Monica, He is right  isn’t he?
Chandler, Y'know what  I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
Chandler, Oh-no  he’s right.
Phoebe,  Hi. 
Monica, Hi!
Joey, Uh  Pheebs  about your mom...
Phoebe, Yeah?
Joey,  How’s that going?
Phoebe, So great. Oh  we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
Joey, That’s so sweet.  I’m gonna get some coffee. 
Monica,  Huh? What’d ya say Joe? I’ll be right there. 
Rachel, Pheebs...
Phoebe, I just feel so  uhh.....
Rachel, All right!!
Chandler, I’m coming already!!
Rachel, Jeez!
Monica,  Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! 
Rachel, Hello  Chip.
Rachel, I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s  have wonderful friends  and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now  I’ve never felt better about myself.
Rachel, She’ll be out in a second. So  Chip  how’s umm  Amy Welch?
Joey, This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction  tons of storage compartments  some big enough to fit a grown man.
Joey, Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t  and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
Joey, Oh yeah?  If I can’t  I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
Joey, Okay.  See?! I told ya!
Joey, Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey  a nickel!!
Monica, Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Monica, That’s what we used to call your ah  your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper  and you’re Chip. Nevermind.
Monica, Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Monica, Umm. Well  there’s Rachel  and umm  I think that’s it. How bout you?
Monica, Is that all?
Monica, Ohh  how is he?
Monica, Isn’t he an architect now?
Chandler, OH MY GOD!!!
Joey,  WHAT?!!
Chandler, Are you all right?!
Joey, Yeah...
Chandler,  What happened?!!
Joey,  Awww  man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
Chandler, What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey, Well  this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler, So—You got in voluntarily?!
Joey, I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh  man  if I ever run into that guy again  do you know what I’m gonna do?
Chandler, BEND OVER?!!!
Monica, Look  not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with  ‘cause I do  but umm  maybe we could talk about something else? Like you  I don’t even know where you work?
Monica, I do?
Monica, You still work at the multiplex?
Monica, Thanks  I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
Rachel, Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  your microwave. The stereo.
Joey,  Aww  man  he took the five of spades!! Oh  no-no-no  here it is!
Monica,  Oh my God! What happened?
Chandler, Oh  umm  Joey was born  and then 28 years later  I was robbed!!
Rachel,  So  how was your date?
Monica, Well  y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Rachel, Um-hmm.
Monica, Well  tonight  I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Rachel, Oh honey  I’m sorry.
Monica, No  it’s okay  not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews  I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Rachel, Ohh! That’s so great!
Monica, I know!
Ross,  Hey! So ah  what did the insurance company say?
Chandler, Oh  they said uh  “You don’t have insurance here  so stop calling us.”
Ross,  You didn’t tell her?!  Okay  fine! Pheebs?
Phoebe, Yeah?  Hi!
Ross, Hi! Listen uhh  this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
Rachel, I’m sorry  sweetie. 
Monica, Hey  we can take her back with you if you want.
Phoebe, Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know  she choose to find me. I mean  I have to respect her decision. Right?
Ross, No! No! Look—Hey  enough is enough! Look  I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom  but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay  Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Phoebe,  Ross  how many parents have you lost?
Ross, None.
Phoebe, Okay  then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong  who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
Ross, I’m sorry.
Phoebe, Okay.
Ross, I don’t know what to say.
Rachel, You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.
Phoebe, I think she would like that.
Ross,  Come here  here  come here  come here   Mrs. Buffay. Sorry  about what I said  umm  it was  it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit  of my friend’s mother.
Phoebe, Thank you. We both forgive you.
Rachel, So honey  what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Phoebe, Yeah  okay  listen  umm  Mom  I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
Chandler, Pheebs  if she could come back as a couch  we’d really appreciate it. 
Phoebe, Come on  Mom  I’ll take you home.
Rachel, I’ll go with you.
Monica, Me too. 
Ross, Oh! Y'know  I’ve got an extra futon.
Joey, Dude  you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Joey, Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. 
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  I’m  I’m paddling away!
Joey,  Huh?!
Chandler, Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey, Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And  some of it is not even popped!
Chandler, Could we be more white trash?
Monica,  How desperate am I?
Rachel, Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here  he always wins at this game.
Monica, I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.
Phoebe, How come?
Monica, Because I need the money  and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Ross, Come on  I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
Monica, You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.
Rachel,  Hey! Umm  do you guys have any juice?
Joey, Just pickle.
Chandler, Hey uh  Rach  funny story. I ah  bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Rachel, My boss  Joanna? Wow  that must’ve been awkward.
Chandler, Well  no  actually she uh  asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Rachel,  You ah  you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?
Chandler,  No. No!
Chandler, Well  not at first.
Rachel, What is she doing here?
Rachel, I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big  dull dud.’
Chandler, Well  I think I judged her too quickly  and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Rachel, Well  last time I almost got fired. You must end it  you must end it now!
Chandler, Oh  come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.
Rachel, Chandler!!  Promise me  you will end it.
Chandler, Okay  I promise  I’ll end it.
Rachel, Thank you.
Chandler, I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya  because she’s not just the boss in your office  if you know what I mean.
Joey, Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh  sorry  I-I knew what he meant.
Monica, Doing great  the quiches are coming along.
Monica, Yeah  I thought it was cute.
Monica, Let me ask you a question.
Monica, Why did you hire me?
Monica,  Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.
Phoebe, Okay  I didn’t hear that.
Monica, Oh yeah  she didn’t hire me out of pity  it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends  she actually thinks I’m good.
Phoebe, Wow! And hey  it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! 
Joey, Uhhhh. 
Joey, No! No. But ah  try the classifieds  people sell everything in there.
Ross, …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.
Monica, …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. 
Chandler, …it was like the Algonquin kids table. 
Joey, Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Phoebe, That’s weird.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Your nails.
Monica, Oh  I know  I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.
Phoebe, Oh  no  I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.
Monica,  Oh my God. Wait a minute  I had them put…  Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!
Phoebe, Okay  don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store  I’m gonna get you another set of nails  no one’s gonna know  and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh  it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.
Monica, Okay ah  please don’t freak out. Umm  but ah  there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups  and there’s no way to know which one.
Phoebe, And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Monica, Then why are you laughing?
Monica, What? You bet I’d lose a nail?
Monica, Frozen lasagnas?
Monica, You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…
Monica, You promised Dr. Weinburg  you’d never use that phrase.
Monica,  That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh  that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe, I don’t get it.
Monica,  No! You have lasagnas! 
Phoebe, Op  the ruined quiches are ready.
Chandler, It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, Thanks.
Chandler, Okay. 
Chandler, I’m getting dressed.
Chandler, When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Chandler, What is it?
Chandler, Ah-ha  you’re not the boss of me.  Yeah  you are!  Ooh  saucy.
Chandler, You are  you’re gonna leave me like this?
Chandler, Okay. But if you don’t come back soon   there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Rachel, That’s weird  she locked the door.
Rachel, Okay  swear you won’t tell  but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?
Chandler, Hi!  How are you?
Chandler, Hello  Joanna……’s office.
Chandler, How little?!
Chandler, Look  this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!
Chandler, Why not?!
Chandler, What?!
Rachel,   What?!
Chandler,  Rachel  could I see you for a moment?
Chandler, Okay  here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject  that is a lovely pantsuit.
Rachel, You promised you would break up with her!
Chandler, I did break up with her! She just took it really  really well!
Rachel, And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Chandler, It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it  shoot right out.
Rachel, Y'know what Chandler  you got yourself into those cuffs  you get yourself out of them.
Chandler, No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on  you have to unlock me  she could be gone for hours  and I’m cold  and 
Rachel, Oh  Chandler!! All right  this is it!  You never see Joanna again!
Chandler, Never!
Rachel, You never come into this office again!
Chandler, Fine!
Rachel, You give me back my Walkman!
Chandler, I—never borrowed your Walkman.
Rachel, Well  then I lost it. You buy me one!
Chandler, You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh! 
Rachel, Does it hurt?
Chandler, No  I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!
Rachel, Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Chandler, About what?
Rachel, When she sees that you’re gone  she’s gonna know that I let you out  and that I was in here  and I’m gonna get fired!
Chandler, I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying  I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Rachel, No  there’s nothing to make up  she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office  I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! 
Chandler, Oh-ho-ho  I don’t think so!
Chandler, Well  this is much better.
Joey, He cut off his ear.
Joey, I’m out.
Joey, Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Joey, In the woods. No wait-wait  that’s the joke answer.
Joey, Spock’s birth control.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hi.
Phoebe, This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.
Monica, Ohh  I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.
Phoebe, Well  who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica, Oh good  I’m glad that’s catching on.
Phoebe, No but  why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do  and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.
Monica, What?
Phoebe," Okay  umm  if a kid gets straight A’s  his parents would say  ""Yeah  he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby  and they go  ""Yeah I know  he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says  ""Yeah  that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change."
Monica,  All right  I’ll go down there. But  I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
Phoebe, Wow! My breasts are really strong. 
Rachel, Chandler! Chandler  please  I have to get you locked up back the way you were  I am sooo gonna lose my job  she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.
Chandler, Hey  look  you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair  she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Rachel, What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Chandler, It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.
Rachel, Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler, Freedom!
Rachel, I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Chandler, Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!  Sophie  help me! Help me!! 
Rachel, Sophie sit!!
Rachel, No! God  would you just calm down!
Chandler, I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… 
Joey, Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.   In a minute. 
Joey, Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day  and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.
Joey, How about zero down and zero a month for a long  long time?
Joey, You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll  a movie stub  keys  a Kleenex  a rock  and an army man. Hey!
Joey, And a 50.  Huh  these must be Chandler’s pants.
Joey, Oh  I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V  I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Rachel, I ah  will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Chandler, No!
Rachel, I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Chandler, With extra pulp?
Rachel,  Yeah!!
Chandler, No!
Rachel, D’oh!!  I’ve got it!
Chandler, You don’t have it.
Rachel, I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this  there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows  Monica and Phoebe know.
Chandler, How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel, Oh  I called them. And when they ask me what I saw  I can be very generous  or very  stingy.
Chandler,  Go on.
Rachel, I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.
Chandler, And Milton Berle has a…
Rachel, Ohh  not compared to you. 
Monica, Well?
Phoebe, They’re not even touching the lasagna!
Monica, Really?!
Phoebe, Oh  they love your casserole.
Monica, Yes!!
Phoebe, It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Monica, And you?
Monica, So if everyone liked it  and you liked it  that would make this a success. Which would make you…
Monica, Well  I was going for wrong  but we can use your word.
Monica, Wow!
Phoebe, Umm  you might even say that she pulled a Monica.   She doesn’t know we switched it. 
Monica, That really means a lot. Oh  and Mom  don’t bite your nails.
Chandler,  Hello.
Monica,  Hello  Chandler. 
Chandler,  I love you. 
Joey, Wh-what’s going on?
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, No he doesn’t!
Chandler,  Two hours  that lasted!
Rachel, So did you break up with Joanna?
Chandler, I think so.
Joey, Well  it’s good thing you got out when you did  before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Ross, The volcano?
Joey, Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes  man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Rachel, What?!
Joey, Oh yeah  lava spewing  hot ash  of course some are dormant.
Monica, Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Joey, Well  we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Monica, Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? 
Phoebe, Oh God  Korea is such a beautiful country.
Ross, With such a sad history.
Chandler, Could there be more Kims?
Rachel, It’s me! Good morning!
Rachel, Yeah  sure. Umm  they didn’t have poppy seed bagels  so I…  Oh my word!
Rachel, Oh  yeah! Yeah!
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Hey! New wallet  huh?
Chandler, Yeah  it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.
Monica, Rachel!
Rachel, What?
Monica, You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Rachel, Oh yeah  I know  but the garbage was full.
Monica, Have you ever taken out the trash? 
Rachel, Well  I thought you liked doing it. 
Monica, Third door on the left.
Rachel, Right!
Rachel, Oh! Hey  Mr. Treeger.
Rachel, Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but…
Rachel, I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.
Rachel, No.
Rachel, I didn’t… I never said that.
Rachel,  Okay  I’m sorry. 
Monica, God! If you’re gonna cry about it! 
Joey, Whoa-whoa  Treeger made you cry?
Rachel, Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Joey, I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Monica, Joey  please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.
Rachel, That’s easy for you to say  you weren’t almost just killed.
Joey, All right that’s it  school is in session! 
Monica,  My God! Is this a gym card?
Chandler, Oh yeah  gym member. I try to go four times a week  but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
Ross, So why don’t you quit?
Chandler, You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No  they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
Ross, Who is Maria?
Chandler, Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her  she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
Ross, You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Chandler, No!
Ross, So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
Chandler, Oh no  you’ll have to come.
Joey, Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend  Rachel  cry. So now  you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her  unless you want me to call the landlord.
Joey, Have you heard about a little something called  Not Making Girls Cry.
Joey, I have actually not heard of that.
Joey, Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know! 
Phoebe, Oh please  somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!
Monica, What’s the matter?
Phoebe, Oh  my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy  and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.
Monica, So do them for free.
Phoebe, Oh no  it is forbidden! No-no  Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.
Ross, They make you take an oath?
Phoebe, No  I made myself take an oath. Yeah  no fooling around with clients and umm  always be prepared. Yeah  that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts  but it just makes good sense.
Chandler, Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
Phoebe, No  I can handle it. No  I’m a professional. 
Rachel, Oh Pheebs  is that a new ankle bracelet?
Monica, Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Chandler, Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
Monica, You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!
Phoebe, I don’t what your talking about. 
Ross, Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Phoebe, Because it’s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
Rachel, Oh! My hero! What happened?
Joey, Well uh  I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later. 
Monica, What a minute  what did he say?
Joey, He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally  so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.
Rachel, What?! You got us evicted!!
Monica, I told you not to go down there!
Joey, Well he made Rachel cry!
Monica, Rachel always cries!
Rachel, That’s not true! 
Monica, Now Joey  you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!
Joey, All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t  you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Rachel, Go!!
Joey, All right  all right  all right.  I mean I’ll have to check with him first  but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it. 
Ross, Whoa-whoa-whoa  hey! Now remember what we talked about  you gotta be strong.
Chandler, Yes.  Yes!
Ross," One more time  ""Hey  don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"""
Chandler, No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Ross, Good! That’s good!
Chandler, Okay.   I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler, I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler,  I wanna quit the gym.
Ross, Me? No.
Chandler,  I wanna quit the gym.
Ross, It’s okay man  be strong. 
Ross, No! And I’m not gonna be  so you can save you little speech.
Phoebe, These old things.
Phoebe, You mean the—Okay by siadic  you mean the towel covered portion.
Phoebe, Sure  yeah  no I can do that  yeah  because umm  y'know  the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know  real  nice and tight. So umm  tell me Rick  how umm  how did you injure the area.
Phoebe, Oh. 
Phoebe, No!
Joey, Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out  this wasn’t there fault  it was mine.
Joey, No you can’t do that  where would the chick and the duck live?
Joey, Noo-no-no  no  those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.
Joey, Come on man  just-just let the girls stay  I’ll do whatever you want.
Joey, Yeah-yeah  absolutely.
Joey, What  what is it?
Joey, That’s not  prison lingo  is it?
Monica, His dancing partner?!
Joey, Yeah  there’s this superintendent’s dance  the Super Ball. I don’t know  and he wants to impress Marge  this lady super that he’s a crush on.
Rachel, Well  why doesn’t he practice with a girl?
Joey, Well  he’s too shy  he doesn’t thing he’s good enough to dance with girls yet.
Rachel, Yeah  right  he almost danced me right down that…garbage chute. 
Monica, Oh  would you let it go already?! You’re fine!
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, Hey! So  did you quit?
Chandler, No  I almost did  couldn’t leave Ross there without a spotter!
Monica, Wait  now so you joined the gym?
Ross, And that’s funny  why?
Rachel, Oh  umm  I was just y’know working out and umm… Oh  that’s it.
Chandler, We’re doomed. Okay  they’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Monica, Well  you could actually go to the gym.
Ross, Or! Or  we could go to the bank  close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Chandler, You’re a genius!
Joey, Aww  man  now we won’t be bank buddies!
Chandler, Now  there’s two reasons.
Phoebe,  Hey.
Phoebe, Ohh  you guys  remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Rachel, Where?!
Phoebe, On the touchy.
Ross, And that’s not against your oath?!
Phoebe, No  I know! I-I’m sorry  but the moment I touch him  I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new  dirty one.
Monica, Well  next time your massaging him  you should try and distract yourself.
Joey, Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited  I just ahh  y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches  and ah baseball  and ah Chandler!
Chandler, Thank you  Joey.
Joey, No-no  thank you.
Joey, All right  I’m here  let’s ahh  get this over with.
Joey, Whoa-whoa  don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh  get really drunk?
Joey, No  it’s okay  but if I’m Marge  my breasts are coming out my back.
Joey, Come on man  you’re not a potato.
Joey, Come on Treeger  don’t say that. You just ahh  you just need more practice. Here  come on  let’s ahh  let’s try it again. Come on.  Plus  it was  it was probably mostly my fault  anyway. I mean  y’know  I’m not really that comfortable dancing with a— We-he!! Hey!
Monica, Hey-hey  how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Joey, Ah-ha-ha  you guys owe me big time. 
Rachel,  What was that?
Joey, What?
Rachel, You just did a little dancy thing.
Joey, No I didn’t.
Monica, Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Rachel, You are soo enjoying this.
Joey, No  I’m not! And it wasn’t a hop it was a pademarie.
Monica,  You know the words! You are so into this!
Joey, All right  well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.
Rachel, Ooh  this is soo sweet  Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Joey, Hey-hey  hold on  this isn’t some kind of like girly dance. All right  it’s like a sport  it’s manly!
Monica, All right  then show me some manly moves.
Joey, All right.
Joey, I don’t know how to lead.
Ross, Hello.
Chandler, Hi.
Ross, We’d like to close our accounts.
Ross, No-no.
Chandler, No  we’d just like to close them.
Chandler, I wanna quit the bank!
Phoebe,  Okay  baseball. Rick  playing baseball. Okay  slides into second  maybe even his pants come down a little… Oh no—wait no  no! No! Okay  all right  sandwiches  sandwiches.

Phoebe,  Chandler’s knees. Chandler’s… ankles. Chandler’s ankle hair.  Oh no.  Okay  you’re all set.
Phoebe, Yeah! In… really long hour world.
Phoebe, Ugh  okay  I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client  I can’t ask you out  even though you give me y’know  the feeling.
Phoebe, Really?!
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe,  Okay  quit down. 
Phoebe, Oh yeah  oh and I know  but this isn’t what it looks like  ‘cause Rick is my ahh  husband.
Phoebe, Yes  I will tell her.
Monica, So you didn’t leave the bank?
Ross, No! And somehow  we ended up with a joint checking account.
Rachel, What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Chandler, To pay for the gym.
Chandler, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey! So I had a great day  Rick and I really hit it off  and we started making out  and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Joey, What?!
Rachel, You got fired?!
Monica, Oh my Gosh!
Phoebe, It’s so weird  I have never been fired from anything before!
Rachel, Sweety...
Phoebe, I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next  y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen  thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day  whore wise.
Chandler, Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.
Joey,  So you ah  ready for our last practice?
Joey, Look  you wanna use our place?
Joey, We did it!!
Joey, I know  it was amazing! I mean  we totally nailed it  it was beautiful.
Joey, Oh well  okay  good luck.
Joey, Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Joey, Okay.
Joey, Go get ‘em Treeger.
Joey,  Really?
Joey, No  I’m good.
Phoebe, Yeah  they thought I was a whore.
Phoebe, Great! Thank you very much.
Ross,  Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number.  Yeah-yeah  there it is  just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.  It's no big deal  I mean it is her home phone number  but... Whoa!  Whoa-whoops  I almost lost this baby! Yeah  the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it. 
Phoebe, Thank you.
Rachel, Yeah?
Rachel, May fifth  why?
Ross, Oh  mine's December...
Chandler, Ohh  she's pretty. Pretty ahh  pretty girl  the pretty--she's pretty.
Monica, Just go up to her and ask her out.  Oh  what's the worst thing that could happen?
Chandler, I could die.
Ross, Yeah  it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Rachel, Ross  you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese  and you didn't even kiss her.
Chandler, I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
Phoebe,  Oh.
Chandler, Hey! 
Monica, Phoebe! You're sick  you shouldn't play. You should just go home  get in bed  and stay there.
Phoebe,  But I'm unemployed  my music is all I really have now. Well music  and making my own shoes.  Pretty  huh? 
Chandler, All right  I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Monica, Just be yourself. But  not too much.
Chandler,   Wish me luck.
Ross,  Good luck!
Chandler, Wish it!  Hi. Hi  I-I was just sitting over there  and uhh  Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
Chandler, Uh Kathy  with K or a C?
Chandler, Oh-oh-hey!
Chandler, Hey  come on  give me a break  I'm out on a limb here.
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Hey  hey-hey  hey. 
Joey, Hey  I see you guys already met  huh?
Chandler, Yes-yes  I was just trying to figure out a way to uh  demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Joey, Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
Phoebe, Before I start  I just wanna say that umm  I have a cold  so if I sneeze in the middle of song  it's not on purpose. Oh  except the last verse of Pepper People.  Smelly cat  smelly cat. What are they feeding you?  This chick sounds good.  Smelly cat  smelly-- Hey Gunther  be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Chandler,  Hi!
Chandler, Jeez  at 2:30 in the morning  I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Chandler, Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
Chandler, Hey  listen  I'm sorry about this afternoon  y'know  if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Chandler, So ah  Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Chandler, That's a good thing actually  because ah  he used to have me rehearse with him.
Chandler, Is it on?
Chandler, Hey! 
Chandler, Oh! It's on! It's on!
Chandler, There we go little fella.
Chandler, Well the duck can swim.
Phoebe,  My sticky shoes  my sticky-sticky shoes  why do you stick on me  ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
Monica, That cold makes you sound so great.
Phoebe, It's fun  God I love how sexy I am. 
Joey, Oh  Kath  we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Rachel, Well  have fun!
Phoebe, Well  I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
Monica, Y'know what  I like Kathy.
Chandler, Oh yeah  me too  she's so cool and pretty.
Rachel, Yeah  she's...
Chandler, She's smart and funny  y'know? We were up all last night talking  she said the funniest thing about--what?
Rachel, You love her.
Chandler, No  I don't.
Phoebe, Yes  you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Ross, Come on  Pheebs lay off him.
Chandler, Thank you  Ross.
Ross, Yeah  he's a little sensitive right now  `cause he's so in love.
Chandler, All right.
Chandler, All right.
Monica,  Ooh  umm  oh Kathy! Kathy  I love you! Oh! 
Phoebe, So  I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice  but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
Monica, Oh umm  how about your mom dying  or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Phoebe," Uh-huh. Oh  yeah  I could write about the time my hair did that ""Woo-hoo"" thing."
Ross,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey.
Ross,  So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Monica, Rachel's not here.
Ross, Oh.
Monica, How's it going with her?
Ross," Great  actually. I'm thinking tonight  maybe the night. Yeah  I mean ah  the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep  I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine  and do a little ""playing"" ourselves."
Rachel,  Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh  these are my friends  and that's Ross.
Monica, Hi  Josh.
Phoebe, Hi.
Monica, So  did you play in college?  sweatshirt he's wearing.)
Rachel, Ross  didn't you ah  play soccer in High School? Oh no wait  that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Rachel, Okay.  I'll miss you.
Phoebe, Wow  cute one!
Monica, Very!
Rachel, I know  isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship  y'know? There's nothing boring about him  and ah  I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Ross, Well maybe he'll get to go soon  like on a class trip or something.
Rachel, Y'know what else is really great about him  oh  what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Ross, Oh! 
Rachel, What was that?
Ross, Monica knows.
Monica, It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger  without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up  `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Ross, Well  I'm gonna go get ready   for my date tonight  so ah  I'll just_ head.
Phoebe, Yeah  I should go to  `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey   you guys should come hear me  ooh hear me. Ooh   My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Wow! You-you look great!
Ross,  Okay!  Hey Tommy.
Ross, Oh no-no-no  it's my pleasure.
Ross, What?
Ross, I-I-I...
Ross, Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Chandler, Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy!  Fetch! Fetch it!  Kathy! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy!  Kathy.
Chandler," Oh  I just wanted to say  ""Hey!"""
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Ross, Her date tipped me ten dollars. 
Ross, Pheebs  what are you doing?
Phoebe, Okay  I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy  supposedly they're pretty common.
Monica, Phoebe  you'll catch pneumonia.
Chandler,  Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Phoebe, What?!
Ross, Are you serious?
Phoebe, Well  how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Chandler, I don't know. I can't--I just  I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean  I'm a very bad person. I'm a very  very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Monica,  Oh gosh  Phoebe  I think I caught your cold.
Phoebe, You mean you stole it!  Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Really?!
Joey, Yeah-yeah  I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Chandler,  Right in there!
Chandler, 99...100! Ready or not  here I come!  All right  let's go over the concept one more time.
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey guys.  Listen uh  you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Chandler, Ohh  umm  y'know what  I already ate.
Joey, It's 4:30.
Chandler, Y'know I had a big meal on Monday  y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Joey, Okay  I see what's going on here.
Chandler, You-you do?
Joey, Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
Chandler, You got me.
Joey, Yeah  you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look  I made an effort to like Janice  now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Chandler, Yeah. Right.
Joey, Good  and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything  right?
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  Ross isn't here.
Rachel, Oh.  Stop it!
Rachel, Yeah!   I am soo gonna marry that guy.  Ohhh!
Monica, What?
Rachel, I think he's stealing from me.
Monica, Why?
Rachel, Because he's stealing from me!
Phoebe,  Hi! It's me. And soup.  Hey  I just saw Josh  he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Rachel, Ughh! 
Phoebe,  Here  now I don't eat chicken  so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either  so it's really just... noodle water.
Monica, Thank you so much Phoebe.
Phoebe,  Sure.
Monica, What are you doing with those?!
Phoebe, But  I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Monica, Sorry  Phoebe.
Phoebe, It's okay. How's the soup?
Monica, Umm. 
Monica, Ohhhh!! Gross!!
Joey, Is she great or what?
Chandler, Ohh  she's-she's not really my type.
Chandler, Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Chandler, Uhh  no-no thanks.
Chandler, Listen  I-I'm gonna grab a beer. 
Joey,  I'll be right back.  What was that?
Chandler, What?
Joey, Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Chandler, Hey  look  what do you want from me?
Joey, I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you  then the least you can do is pretend.
Chandler, I am pretending.
Joey, Well then  do it better!
Chandler, Okay  what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good  I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically  over-the-top  wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her  that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Joey, Well  that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
Ross,  Hey! So  uhh  Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah  that's one of the things I love about her  she's...uh  she's old enough to drive.  So uhh  I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
Monica, No  sorry.
Rachel, Well where's Amanda?
Monica, Hey Rach  could you get me some cough drops?
Rachel, I mean y'know  I'm thinking. You could bring her  and you guys could go up to your old room  and not make out.
Monica, Ross  cough drops  please?
Ross, At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Rachel, Why don't you just marry her? Oh no  wait a minute you can't  I'm sorry I forgot  she's not a lesbian.
Ross, You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Monica,  You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Rachel,  Ohh  that is soo sad.
Monica, And what are you laughing at  Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
Rachel, Hey  so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! 
Monica, That's mine!! Now  would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Ross, Fine.
Rachel, Sorry.
Ross, Here.   At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Rachel, Y'know...
Phoebe,  Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting  leaving little treats.  Does it even work without my sexy voice?
Phoebe, Gunther  kiss me.
Joey,  Hey!  Now  we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her  but do you mind?
Chandler, Can I sleep on your couch?
Phoebe,  And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, No!
Rachel,  Okay.
Rachel,  Okay.
Ross, You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Phoebe, Hey what are you guys looking at?
Chandler, Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Phoebe, Yeah  come to papa.
Ross, I know!
Monica, Probably the only time I'll ever say this  but did you see the ass on her?
Chandler, Where did you  when did you  how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?
Rachel, Yeah  so what is she  like a... like a spokesmodel  or an aerobics instructor  what?
Ross, Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate  specializing in the centazoic era.
Chandler, Okay  but that's  like  the easiest era.
Ross, I've seen her at work  but I always figured  ah-huh? But  uh  I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Rachel, Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Ross, Fine by me; hope she wins.
Chandler, Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Phoebe, Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Chandler, Phebes  it was your birthday  like  months ago.
Phoebe, Yeah  but remember you said you ordered something special  and it just hasn't come yet?
Chandler, Well  I have a call in about that.
Phoebe, 'Kay.
Chandler, Actually  this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Rachel, Oh  The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God  when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Chandler, Okay  but don't touch it  because you fingers have destructive oils.
Rachel, Huh. Well  then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Chandler, Oh  it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores  talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Rachel, Oh  honey  that's so sweet.
Phoebe," Yeah  and what a great way to say  ""I secretly love you  roommate's girlfriend!"""
Chandler, It doesn't say that. Does it?
Ross, How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Chandler, Okay  all right  I'll just uh  make sure that uh  Joey gets her something really great.
Phoebe, It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Monica,  Yeah  once again  I am sorry. Thank you. Bye.  I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Rachel, Oh my God! What happened?
Monica, Sixty guests.
Ross, So  uh  why did you have to turn it down?
Monica, Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Phoebe, Wow  what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't   not Monican...  ...Monica. Look  you know  you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Monica, I don't know.
Phoebe, There you go  that's the spirit! Okay! Now  if you need money  I will lend you money  but just get moving!
Monica, Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Phoebe, Okay! It's worth it  if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Monica, Well  you're not working either.
Phoebe, Yes  but I'm doing this.
Monica, Yeah  that'd be great! Thank you!
Joey, Hey!
Joey, Why?
Joey, You can pee here!
Chandler, It's okay  the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
Joey, We've only been going out for a couple of weeks  do you think I gotta get her something?
Rachel, Yes  you have to get her something  and it should be something really nice.
Joey, Oh  I know...
Rachel," And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love."""
Phoebe, Ooo  a crossword! Can I help?
Rachel, No! I'm sorry  honey  it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Phoebe, Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  how'd it go?
Monica, Oh my God  it was the best funeral ever! I mean  everyone loved the food  and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean  it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
Phoebe, Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Monica, Thanks. Like  check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
Phoebe, I'll have one  please. Plus my money.
Monica, Oh. Well  I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean  you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean  I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow  so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Phoebe, Oh. Okay. Oo  sorry I acted like a bank.
Monica, Okay.
Ross,  Huh...
Ross, Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Ross, Mitzi is.....
Ross,  Uh... Oh hey  do you  uh  ...do you have any  um  Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Ross, Well  I do! Why don't we go back to my place  light a couple of candles  break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties  uh...
Ross, Oh  yeah  why not?
Monica, Oh  is everything in the car?
Phoebe, Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Monica, No. I hate this part.
Phoebe, Oh  look what we almost left. 
Monica, No  that's not mine.
Phoebe, Oh  all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Monica, Excuse me  Mrs. Burkart? Well  we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Monica, Um  and  well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Monica, Just the matter of ...payment?
Rachel, You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
Chandler,  Sure...
Rachel, And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
Chandler, I don't know... um  Grease?
Rachel, No....
Chandler, Rent?
Rachel, Yes! Rent!
Chandler, Okay  so when do you want to go?
Rachel, What? Oh  I'm sorry  I can't  I'm busy.
Joey,  Hey. Man  it is so hard to shop for girls.
Chandler, Yes  it is  at Office Max.
Rachel, What did you get her? 
Chandler, A pen.
Joey, It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
Chandler, Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Joey, Why not?
Chandler, Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Rachel, Okay  honey  what he means by that  is ...while this is a very nice gift  maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Joey," Sure it is! She needs a pen for work  she's writing  she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"""
Chandler, All right  look  look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Joey, She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Chandler, For three years?
Joey,  Look  it's too late  and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Chandler, All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her  okay?
Joey, Thanks  man. And oh  while you're at it  could you get her a card?
Chandler, Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Joey, Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Phoebe, But Mon  you have to get our money!
Monica, Oh  Phoebe  she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses  her tears looked giant.
Phoebe, I know  it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
Monica, What?
Phoebe," Pay the caterer! Look  I've had a lot of jobs  okay  and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either  you know  ""that massage wasn't long enough  or  ""I don't recognize any of those songs "" or  you know  ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"""
Monica, Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Phoebe, Well  it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Monica, Phoebe  she sounded pretty upset to me.
Phoebe, She seems fine now.
Joey, So  you just left? Her place was really that bad?
Ross, You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Well  like that  only instead of a chair  it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket  it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day  it's the end of time  and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Joey, Wow. Thanks. So  uh  what happened?
Ross, What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Joey, All right  so... next time  you take her to your place.
Ross, No  I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
Joey, What kind of smell?
Ross, I don't know. Soap?
Joey, All right  listen  Ross... you like this girl  right?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, You wanna see her again  right?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Ross, Yeah  okay you're right.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, I mean  uh  who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, It's  uh... it's endearing  really.
Joey, All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink!
Chandler, Okay  all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Rachel, Any luck?
Chandler," Oh  yeah. Yeah  I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy.""  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?"
Rachel, All right  look. Why don't you just return the book  let Joey give her the clock pen  and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
Chandler, She's really going to love this  you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it  even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Rachel, Aw  honey  that's so sweet.
Chandler, Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Rachel, Oh! Pathetic! 
Joey,  Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Chandler, Where?
Joey, Our place  the hall! I...
Chandler, I got something for her.  It's a book!
Joey,  A book?  Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Chandler, No  it's a book that's just a book  okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So  uh  just... let me know if she likes it  okay?
Joey, You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this  I owe you one.  Oh  hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty  was there?
Chandler, No  it came out to an even twenty.
Joey, Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Phoebe, You didn't get the money  did you?
Monica, Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe  come on... you know what? Let's just go!
Phoebe, No! Hey  we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey  widow?
Phoebe, Okay  Widow!
Phoebe, Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um  clearly this is a very  very hard time for you. Um  but  um  we provided a service  and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service  and  um  we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what  lady? We're part time caterers  and we have no place else to go.
Phoebe, Good. 
Monica, I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Ross,  Yes. Yes I do. 
Ross, Department of Sanitation?
Ross, Oh!  Ah.  Aw! 
Ross,  Ah  Cheryl!
Ross, Oh my god! I'm so sorry  Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Rachel, I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Rachel, Hey! Hey  you guys  I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
Phoebe, Uh... yay!
Rachel, Thanks!
Monica, Oh  that's great! Congratulations!
Rachel, Thank you! Hey  how'd the catering go?
Monica, Oh  it was great! The widow wouldn't pay  so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Phoebe, Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Monica, And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Phoebe, Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Monica, Wait a minute  Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean  think about it! You're not working right now  and we have such a great time together!
Phoebe, Okay!
Monica, I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Phoebe, Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey  how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Joey, Oh  man  she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Chandler, Oh yeah? That's great!
Joey, Hey  listen  I gotta tell ya  I feel kinda bad taking credit for this  because man  am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Chandler,  Aahhuuhhh....
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Happy birthday.
Joey, You know  uh...  Chandler got you a gift  too.
Chandler, No he didn't. 
Joey, Yeah  he did  look... look  it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Chandler, Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
Chandler, See  you think it's just a pen  but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Chandler, Oh  yeah... yeah.
Joey, Ah. Hm.  Wanna go to bed?
Joey, Oh  uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Chandler,  Goodnight.
Chandler, Oh  uh  yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing  you... you don't always know the exact time.
Chandler, Uh  the book?
Chandler, What do you mean?
Chandler,"  Uhl..ell. By the way  in case you missed that  that sound was  ""Uhl  ell."""
Chandler, Oh  yeah  he's my... he's my best friend.
Chandler, Goodnight. 
Joey,  Hey  that coupon expires  you know.
Monica, Hi. Uh  you... you don't know me  I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Monica, Yeah. Anyway  he told me about your apartment. And  um  I couldn't sleep  thinking about it. So  uh  would it be okay if I cleaned it?
Monica, No?
Chandler,  I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Ross, Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured  you’re in for a big surprise.
Chandler, It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way  I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy  but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on  I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles  she’s smooth! Smooth! 
Phoebe, Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Joey, Great! All right  so I’ll call you later.
Chandler,  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey, That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
Chandler, Goin’ out  huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy  huh? Bummer.
Joey, No  things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight  right after my early dinner with Casey.
Chandler,  What?
Joey, Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! 
Chandler, Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
Joey, Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler, Well  I’m upset—for you. I mean  having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
Joey, What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
Chandler, Look  Joey  Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey  I mean granted I only saw the back of her head  but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart  and funny  and gets you.
Joey, You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler, All right look  I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice  pick a lane.
Joey, Who’s Elaine?
Phoebe,"  ""Little  tiny Tarzan  swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now  I don’t know who to get to the next verse."
Ross," Oh  you could just go uh  ""greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it."
Phoebe, Yeah  ooh  I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
Ross, Well umm  y’know  I used to play.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  that’s right  the keyboards  huh?
Ross, Yeah  just a little in high school  but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
Monica, Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose  but it was totally worth it. Oh my God  I completely forgot about your sound.
Ross, Yeah.
Monica," He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear  ""The Sound."""
Phoebe," I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
Ross, Really? No. I mean  nah  I haven’t played in so long  and-and  well it’s-it’s really personal stuff  y’know?
Phoebe, Come on  play that funky music white boy.
Monica, Yeah!
Ross, No  you guys  I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No  yeah  okay. 
Ross, Okay  guys.
Chandler, All right! Bring it on  you…
Ross, Here we go.  Y’know  I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before  so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions.  Y’know  umm  you should-you should think of umm  my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…
Chandler,  Oh my God! Play!
Monica,  Boy  that was-that was  umm… terrific.
Chandler, Really  bitchin’!
Phoebe, Wow  it was so—wow!
Ross, Really?! I mean  really?!!
Rachel, Yeah  I mean  you should play in public!
Ross, Wow! Thanks  you guys. That’s uh—ohhh  I wanna  I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh  helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice  I’m—I am so… 
Monica, Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Rachel, Oh  I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Phoebe, What are you guys talking about  I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh  plus it’s just  it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Chandler, You mean like  music?
Chandler, Yeah  I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes  yes  your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Chandler, Come in!
Chandler, Uh yes  but uh  I just watch it for the articles.
Chandler, No-no  he’s not back yet  but he’ll be here any minute. So uh  come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Chandler, I like it in the stern.  …of the boat.   Hello.
Joey,  Hey  it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Chandler, What happened?
Joey, We broke down on the Parkway  so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey  listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Chandler, Why can’t you tell her?
Joey, ‘Cause I only have one quarter  and I think my time is about to—
Chandler, Joey! Joey!!
Joey, Yeah?
Chandler, I thought your time ran out.
Joey, Me too  but I guess I do have a couple of more—
Chandler,  Uhh  that was Joey. He’s running a little late  he says he’s sorry.
Chandler, So I guess it’s just uh  you and me then.
Chandler, Yeah  I think it is!
Chandler, Oh  I had an appointment to get my haircut…
Chandler, …and then it got canceled.
Chandler, Really?! You do that?
Chandler, Dog grooming huh? Okay  just don’t make my tail too poofy.
Chandler, Well  thanks. I grow it myself.  Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
Chandler, What-what ‘cha doin’?
Chandler, ‘Kay.
Chandler,  Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds!  Hello!
Joey,  Hey dude  it’s me.
Chandler, Hey it’s Joey!
Joey, Listen uh  I’m really sorry  it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid  but when I went to put it in the car  the transmission wasn’t there!
Chandler, What?
Joey, Yeah  it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, Listen uh  could you put Kathy on  I wanna apologize.
Chandler, Oh yeah man.  Joey. 
Chandler, Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
Chandler, Oh.
Chandler, No-no-no-no  this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
Chandler, Wait the uh  the kiss or the situation?
Chandler, Okay!
Chandler, Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do  we-we forget it happened.
Chandler, Okay  we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?
Chandler, I have to; he’s my best friend  and you’re seeing him.
Chandler,  Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see  you’re getting me confused  I’m starting to urn.
Chandler, I-I think we have too.
Chandler, Bye.  Are you still out there?
Ross,  Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time…
Monica,  Y'know  there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Phoebe,  It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Ross,  Thank you guys-guys-guys…
Monica,  Hey  aren’t you up next?
Phoebe, Oh no  I’m not playing tonight.
Rachel, Why not?
Phoebe, I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Monica, Phoebe  Ross sucks!
Rachel, Phoebe  the place has emptied because of him.
Phoebe, Oh my God  he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Monica, Okay. Umm  Phoebe  you suck too.
Rachel, Yeah  Phoebe you’re… awful!
Phoebe, You guys. You suck too. 
Joey, Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! 
Chandler, Hang on buddy! 
Joey,  Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Chandler, I sure did.
Joey, Why?
Chandler, Well  I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Joey, Well  you’re amazing.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. 
Joey,  A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man  how did you afford this stuff?
Chandler, Well  y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Joey, Oh  you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Chandler, Oh  I don’t know.
Joey, Oh-no-no-no  you are! You do this  you give me the great advice  and hey listen  I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman  I’m gonna do that.
Chandler, You mean with Casey.
Joey, No-no-no  I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.
Chandler, Or Casey.
Joey, No-no  Kathy.
Chandler, Could be Casey.
Joey, No. No  Kathy.
Chandler, Consider Casey.
Joey, Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Chandler, That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! You were really great! You were really  really great!
Ross, Oh  thanks  thanks. So Monica tells me that uh  you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Phoebe, Well  kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Ross, Pheebs…
Phoebe, Yeah  I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it  I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
Ross, See but  Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire  and if it bothers you this much  then I… I won’t play anymore.
Phoebe, Oh no. No-no-no  don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Ross, Yeah  okay.
Ross, Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica, Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler, I kissed Kathy.
Ross, What?
Monica, Are you serious?
Phoebe, Does Joey know?
Chandler, No. Is there anyway  anyway you think he’ll understand this?
Monica, You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.
Ross, No the-the sad thing is  if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her  knowing Joey  he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
Chandler, Oh  don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
Phoebe, I think maybe  yeah.
Monica, He loves you.
Chandler, Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
Ross, Well  I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe, Yeah! No  that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Rachel, I know  I remember that!
Monica, I remember you did.
Chandler, God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Rachel, Well  Chandler  you’re gonna have to tell him.
Chandler, Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel, Because you do.
Chandler, Yeah  I know.
Ross, Hey  would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Chandler, Is that a real thing?
Joey, Well  we only had samboucha  so it is now.
Chandler, Listen ah  Joe  I-I need to  I need to talk to you about something.
Joey, What’s up?
Chandler, It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm  uh  I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Joey, You do?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Well  you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Yeah  she broke up with me.
Chandler, Oh uh  when?
Joey, Just now  after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene  that’s why I let people watch.
Chandler, Oh man  I am so sorry. Are  are you okay?
Joey, Well  I’ve been better. But  I’m all right. So you like her huh?
Chandler, Yes  but I-I uh  don’t have too.
Joey, No-no-no  no it’s uh  it’s okay.
Chandler, Yeah?
Joey, Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
Chandler, Well  I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Joey, But hey  listen just so you know  you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her  I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…
Chandler, See uh  that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Joey, Who?
Chandler, It’s me. I’m the other guy.
Joey, What?
Chandler, Yeah  I mean when you were late last night  Kathy and I got to talking  and one thing to another and…
Joey, And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler, No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey, What?!! That’s even worse!!
Chandler, How is that worse?!
Joey, I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Chandler, Look  I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do  I think I’m in love with her!
Joey, Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Chandler, You’re right  I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey, Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line  that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler, Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Joey, Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well  y’know what I will not watch your TV  I will not listen to your stereo  and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!
Chandler, Probably because…
Joey, Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.  Oh  and just so you know  I made that bread for you. 
Phoebe, Oh my God  he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.
Monica,  What?
Rachel, Phoebe  his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Ross, Thank you  thanks.  Yeah  I lost it. Y’know  I’m not gonna play anymore   would you  can you finish my set?
Phoebe, After that? Yeah! No  I mean if I can help.
Ross, Yeah  like I could lose it.
Rachel, What?
Ross, I played bad on purpose guys.
Monica, Okay  so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Ross, Yeah—no  just that last song.
Joey,  Hello.
Chandler,  Hey  it’s me. I know you can’t stand to be in the same room as me  so I just thought I’d try and apologize over the phone. All I… 
Joey,  Hello.
Chandler, Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend  but I’m… 
Joey,  Stop callin’!!
Joey, All right!
Chandler,  Aww  turkey! Aww  giving thanks! Aww!
Phoebe, Look everyone  it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Rachel, So are things with you and Joey any better?
Chandler, They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night  just trying to get him to talk to me.
Rachel, Oh wow  eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Ross, Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
Rachel, You shouldn’t.
Phoebe, Speaking of Christmas  umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money  umm  this year maybe we could do secret Santa  and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.
Ross, Who gets whom.  I don’t know why I do that.
Rachel, Well  I’m gonna take a nap  turkey makes me sleepy.
Monica, We haven’t eaten yet!
Rachel, I know  but all that work you’re doing to get it ready  I just… 
Chandler, Hey  by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa  ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
Phoebe, I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
Chandler, Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Phoebe, Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets  it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on  let’s trade!
Chandler, Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Oh  there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase  and I had R.G. put on it…  Her initials…
Phoebe, Ohh.
Monica, Well  maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh  like Ross Geller.
Chandler, Op  y'know what though  it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
Monica, Who cares? He works in a museum!
Chandler, Hey  what time is it? The big game is about to start!
Phoebe, You don’t have to do that  Ross and Joey aren’t here  you can watch the parade if you want.
Chandler, Thanks.
Monica, What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!
Phoebe, God  what happened?!
Monica, Oh my God  ice just got in my eye!
Rachel,  People are trying to sleep in here!
Chandler, Monica got ice in her eye  and it hurts.
Phoebe, Open it up  let me see.
Monica, Oh  y’know what  I can’t  it really kills.
Chandler, Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
Phoebe, Ooh  God it looks bad.
Rachel, Honey  maybe we should take you to a doctor.
Monica, No  my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!
Chandler, He’s really picky about his patients.
Phoebe, Honey  you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?
Monica, Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.
Phoebe,  Hi! Yeah  I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye  and is um  is Richard Burke in today.   He’s out of town  but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Monica, Yes!!
Phoebe, Yes! She’s very excited about that.
Phoebe, This is so cool  ‘til Monica gets back  it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. 
Ross, Hey-hey  I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Phoebe, Okay  get out of my kitchen!
Chandler,  All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey  when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah  he gave me the finger while doing it.
Phoebe, All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
Ross, So listen ah  I picked Monica for secret Santa  but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah  I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Chandler, Oh y’know what  I was already trying to trade for ah  well  you.
Ross, Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice  what are you gonna get me?
Chandler, I don’t know R.G.  I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Ross, Yeah  well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  you don’t want to do that  then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Ross, Oh  that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Chandler, Like?
Ross, Like uh  that gold necklace I got her last year.
Chandler, When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Ross, Well  she wore it all Christmas day  and then uh…
Chandler, Big dog?
Ross,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, What are you doing?
Joey, I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Ross, Everything? Even the TV?
Joey, No! I’m putting that in my room.
Ross, Listen  Joey  I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Joey, Back when you and Rachel were together  if Chandler had kissed her  would you hear him out?
Ross, That’s a good point. So uh  how long are you gonna punish him?
Joey, Five years.
Ross, You’ve sentenced him?!
Joey, Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.
Ross, Joey  the guy’s your best friend.
Joey, No  was my best friend. Anyway  I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend  there’s a spot open.
Ross, Oh  who? Me?
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Joey, What?
Ross, I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Joey, All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.
Chandler, I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me  he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Joey,  Hey Gunther  have you uh  have you seen Chandler?
Chandler, Hey Joe.
Joey,  
Monica, Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Rachel, Ooh  so cute  that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Monica, Oh no-no-no  not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
Chandler, Hey! I’m sorry! That— where are you going?
Joey, My folks.
Chandler, Oh  uh  when-when are you coming back?
Joey, I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Yeah  y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know  work it out  but uh  seeing you two together I don’t think I…
Chandler, Hey  look  what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?
Joey, Look  it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So  I’ll see ya. 
Chandler, Hey  look  I know what it is to be a friend  I just-I just screwed up!
Joey, Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.
Chandler, All right look  if you’re not gonna stay for me  then at least stay for them! Okay  they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
Joey, When that guy was robbing us  and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours  you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
Chandler, What?
Joey, Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be  I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!
Chandler, All right  wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?
Joey, We’ve got a box. 
Monica, I was probably waiting for it to open.
Monica, You look great too.
Monica, So how does it look?
Monica, Like a pirate?!
Monica, Umm  so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on  one of us had to mention him.
Monica, Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Monica, No way!
Monica,  Oh.
Monica,  Oh.
Monica,  Oh.  So you made her walk the plank? Aye  matie?
Monica, I know.
Ross, He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!
Rachel, I know  it’s sick.
Monica, Why is it sick?
Rachel, Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
Monica, Hey  come on  Phoebe  you understand don’t you?
Phoebe, Yeah  I can see where I’d be your best shot but  no. I’m sorry  but I think it’s twisted.
Ross, Yeah.
Joey,  What’s twisted?
Monica, Me going out with Richard’s son.
Joey, Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Chandler,  Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Rachel, Is he okay in there?
Joey, He’s fine!
Ross, Hey  y'know  Mon  if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son  you’d be able to tell your kids  that you slept with their grandfather.
Monica, Fine! Judge all you want to but   married a lesbian   left a man at the altar   fell in love with a gay ice dancer   threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire   livin’ in a box!! 
Rachel, So now  what exactly is the point of the box?
Joey, Chandler?
Chandler, The meaning of the box is three fold. One   it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two   it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three   it hurts!
Ross,  Oh hey! Hey uh  you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
Rachel,  Why?
Ross, I just wanna check something.
Rachel, Okay. 
Ross,   Now  we’ll see.
Chandler, Air hole! Air hole!! 
Rachel,  Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
Ross,  The necklace I got you was gold  this one is silver.
Rachel, Huh  well maybe it uh  it changed.
Ross, Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
Rachel, Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
Ross, What did you get?
Rachel, Credit.
Monica,  I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it!  Hi  Tim.
Monica, Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh  Phoebe.
Monica, And Joey.
Joey, Hey!
Monica, My brother  Ross.
Ross, Hey.
Monica, And Rachel.  And that’s Chandler.
Chandler, How do ya do.
Monica, Umm  well  he’s…
Joey, He’s doin’ some thinkin’!
Chandler, What happened? What happened?!
Joey, You kissed my girlfriend!
Rachel, Ooh  I like those sunglasses.
Ross, Like ‘em  like ‘em? Or  I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
Rachel, 
Monica, All right everybody  this turkey is ready!
Monica, Here  let me show you. Okay  the towels are hanging next to the sink  and umm  you can use the fancy soap.
Rachel, Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
Monica, See he’s nice. Right?
Phoebe," Yeah  but Monica  do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase  ""That’s not how your dad used to do it."""
Monica, I saved you a seat. 
Rachel,  Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Phoebe, Oh  I’ll get it. 
Chandler, Gotcha! 
Joey, That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!
Chandler, Sorry!
Joey, Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Chandler, Okay  okay  you got it!
Rachel, Ross  can you pass me the yams?
Ross, Sure! Oh  and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Rachel, Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Monica, Oh-ho-ho  we’ve got company.
Ross, There’s nothing the matter with me. See  I’m not completely devoid of sentiment  see I have feelings.
Rachel, Okay  fine. 
Chandler, You can’t tell  but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
Joey, All right  look! If this is just a big joke to you  then forget about it  all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you  then you should get out of there  otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!
Chandler, You’re right  and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear  I won’t say another word tonight.
Joey, So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Chandler, Absolutely!
Joey, That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.
Rachel, Don’t say that I have no sentiment!  This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed!  This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay  maybe I exchange gifts sometimes  but I keep the things that matter!
Ross, I don’t know what to say  I’m sorry. Though  you’re not supposed to take these.  It’s like a million years old  we  we actually  we had people looking for that.
Monica,  Ooh  this always happens. 
Monica, Thank you.
Monica, Y’know all my friends think this is weird.
Monica, I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad  that’s a totally separate thing.
Monica, We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
Monica, Nothing. Nothing.
Monica, No-no-no that was good  it was  that was uh  that was a goood kiss…
Monica,  Don’t say it!
Monica, Yeah!
Monica, I know!
Joey, I’ll get it. 
Joey, Hey.
Joey, That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.
Joey, In the box.
Phoebe, Oh  he-he can’t talk right now.
Phoebe, He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
Rachel, Joey  had reasons.
Phoebe, They were threefold.
Joey,  Open the box!! 
Rachel, What?!
Joey, He can still catch her! Come on  get out of there!  Get out of there!
Chandler, So?
Joey, Yeah  we’re gonna be fine! Get out!
Chandler, Yeah?
Joey, Yeah  you did some real good thinkin’ in there.
Chandler, Man  this is…
Joey, Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! 
Joey, All right  who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh  need to trade.
Rachel, Oh  he sees her!
Monica, Oh  he’s catching up to her!
Phoebe, Oh  she sees him! Oh  they’re hugging!
Ross, He’s taking her purse!
Joey, Uhh  that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.
Phoebe, Oh  there they are!
Phoebe, All right  get a room.
Phoebe, Okay!
Monica, Come on  no peeking! 
Chandler, Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.
Phoebe, Okayyyyy  open up!
Ross, What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Phoebe, Yeah  it’s for our catering business!
Joey, I think I know that girl.
Monica, All right  umm  we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.
Rachel, No?
Phoebe, No  we’re gonna paint over the sword  and replace it with a baguette.
Rachel, Oh!
Phoebe, And also  we don’t know what to do with this. 
Joey, Oh yeah  I definitely know her.
Monica,  Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Phoebe, Oh sure  Cilantro Larry.
Monica, Well  I’m gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Monica, Wow  Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.
Phoebe, How could you say yes  what about our catering business?
Monica, Oh no-no-no  it’s only one night a week  and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Phoebe, Oh  in that case——Yay!  That was me hopping on board.
Monica, Oh.
Chandler,  Hey  you guys! Hey  Ross  quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Ross, I don’t know  I could maybe go out for a couple of beers  but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Chandler, No-no  I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Ross, Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Chandler, Kathy’s with her parents  I have nothing to do  so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Ross, Dude  we are sooo gonna party!
Phoebe, Wow! Okay  dude alert! And who is this guy?
Ross," Mike ""Gandolf"" Ganderson  only like the funest guy in the world."
Chandler, I’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
Ross, I’m gonna call after you!
Chandler, This is gonna be soo cool  dude  we never party anymore!
Monica, All right  were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Joey, Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me  remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Ross, Joey  you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
Joey, Well  why do you call him Gandolf?
Ross, Gandolf the wizard.  Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
Joey, No  I had sex in high school.
Rachel, Oh  uh  Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…
Rachel, Well  actually  I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…
Rachel, God  I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this  because if you did  I wouldn’t even consider applying.
Rachel,  And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.
Rachel, Ohh! That’s great!
Rachel, Really?!
Rachel, Well  I  umm…
Chandler, Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!
Joey, Will you calm down  he’s just a human guy.
Chandler, Look you don’t understand  Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening  you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
Joey, Really?!
Chandler, Oh yeah  it’s beautiful country up there.
Ross,  Hey! Okay! I got my passport  fresh socks  and a snake bite kit!
Chandler, It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
Joey, All right  I’ll see you guys.
Chandler, Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey, I have an audition  but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Ross, Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Joey, Okay. 
Chandler,  Hello.   It’s Gandolf!!!  So  are you in town?   Oh  well  well maybe next time then. 
Ross, What happened?
Chandler, He’s not gonna make it  he’s stuck in Chicago.
Ross, Ohh  man! Chicago  is sooo lucky!
Chandler, Stupid  useless Canadian money!
Rachel, Thank you.
Rachel, Well  they uh  they-they do more than that.
Rachel, Yes  Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Rachel, I-I-I of course  I have more responsibilities than that.
Rachel, Yes  I realize that…
Rachel, I love working with designers!
Monica, Hey! My first review is out!
Phoebe, Ohh! Oh  the Chelsea Reporter  ohh  this used to keep me so warm.
Monica, All right  look at my on the back page.
Phoebe," Oh  okay!  ""Would I go back to Allesandro’s? Sure  but I’d have to order two meals  one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.""  Wow! You really laid into this place."
Monica, Hey  they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Phoebe, Ooh  I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Monica, Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Phoebe, No-no  it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?
Monica, Haven’t we made this decision?
Phoebe, Yeah  all right. 
Monica, Bye!
Phoebe, Bye!
Monica,  Who is it?
Monica, Oh my God.
Monica, Oh my God  oh my God.  Call me on the phone!
Monica, Look  I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
Phoebe,  Hey  do you need to get in? Here you go.
Monica, No! Phoebe!
Phoebe, Hey  Monica!
Monica, I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it  and one of them eats books.
Monica, The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Monica, All right  that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review  I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Monica, Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Monica, Hand me those tomatoes  I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on  hand me them.
Rachel,  Umm  Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
Rachel, No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.  Now  just to brief you…  I may cry  but they are not tears of sadness or of anger  but just of me having this discussion with you.
Rachel, There’s nobody here!
Rachel, Do you want me to quit?
Rachel, Well of those things that you said in the interview  I mean if you believe any of them  I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk   and I will be gone by the end of the day!  Well  I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day! 
Rachel, What?
Rachel, My drinking?
Rachel, Said what? Exactly.
Rachel, Oh my God!! Ohh  that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Rachel, Say more things like that.
Rachel, I’d need an expense account.
Rachel, And an assistant.
Joey, Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Ross, It’s Gandolf  and he’s not coming.
Joey, So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?
Ross, No! I balanced my checkbook.
Chandler, Yeah  and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
Ross, I can’t believe he didn’t come!
Joey, So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Chandler, Oh-no  y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!
Ross, Yeah! We’d meet  we’d meet total strangers  and hang out with them!
Joey, Well  we could do that!
Ross, There’s other stuff too.
Joey, We’ll do it all  and better! Look  after tonight  Gandolf will want to party with us  dude! Come on!
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Yeah!!
Joey, Yeah!!
Ross, It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
Joey, Yeah! All right? Let’s go!
Chandler, And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Chandler, All right!!
Ross,  Hey-hey-hey  when uh  when were we on a boat?
Chandler, Remember that really cold morning  you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Well  those were seals  man.
Rachel, Hey Mon  little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Monica, Okay  the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me  but instead I made him some sauce  and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Rachel, Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home  but I’m soo happy!
Monica, Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Rachel, Ohh  you’ve waited soo long.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey  Pheebs  quick question for ya.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?
Phoebe, I don’t know  it would totally depend on her coloring and…  You got the job!!
Rachel, Yes!!!
Monica, You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?
Rachel, Ohh  it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell  I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!
Phoebe, Okay  is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
Monica, Ohh! Umm  Phoebe  I kinda need to talk to you about that.  Umm  well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
Phoebe, But we’ve only had one job.
Monica, I know  but now we have this second one and it just  it feels like it’s snowballing  y’know?
Phoebe, Yeah! What are you saying?
Monica, I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro’s.
Phoebe, What?
Monica, It’s okay  ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.
Phoebe, You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Monica, All right. But umm  I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested  and you can keep the van.
Phoebe, For what? I can’t believe this! I gotta get out of here. 
Monica, Phoebe  wait a minute! 
Rachel, I’m an assistant buyer!!
Joey, All right  so we’ll get a little coffee  and get energized  and we’ll head back out.
Chandler, Yeah  all right.
Ross, Okay.
Joey, So  we’re having fun  right?
Joey, We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs  talked to some strangers  and uh  after this  we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
Ross, I’m kinda beat.
Chandler, Actually  me too.
Joey, Are you serious?!
Joey, Thank God! I’m exhausted!
Joey, Yeah  but uh  I don’t want to be up too late  so uh  I’ll have a decaf.
Ross, Yeah  me too.
Chandler, Actually  can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Joey, I can’t hear a word you’re saying  my ears are ringing so bad.
Ross, I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks  y’know? I used them as mittens  I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.
Ross, How sad are we?
Joey, Yeah  I know.
Chandler, Y’know what? We’re not sad  we’re not sad  we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old  damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair  and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Joey, Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Ross, And so what if I like to go home  throw on some Kenny G  and take a bath!
Joey, We’re 29  we’re not women.
Monica,  Ohh  here you are. Y’know  I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.
Phoebe, Okay  I’m hearing.
Monica, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm  well  I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm  you could be flower delivery person.
Phoebe, What?!
Monica, Or! A bakery delivery person.
Phoebe, I wa-I wa-I wa…
Monica, Pizza?!
Phoebe, Monica!
Monica, All right  I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh  stuff in this area  but umm  I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.
Phoebe, No.
Monica, Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver  you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.
Phoebe, No.
Monica, Y’know what  let’s do the catering business.
Phoebe, Really?! Are you sure?
Monica, Yeah  y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what  it’d be  it’d be fun.
Phoebe, Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay  ooh  let’s plan the wedding reception.  Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van.  Y’know what  I want you to take the chef job.
Monica, Really?!
Phoebe, Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah  I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy  that would just make me unhappy  and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.
Monica, Thank you.
Phoebe, Besides  it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Rachel, Oh  hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
Rachel, Heard what?
Rachel, Oh my God! How?!
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh  I cannot believe it!
Rachel, Oh  God. Oh  God.  Oh God.
Rachel, Yes  so close. Mrs. Lynch  I know that this is an emotional and difficult time  for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.
Rachel, Yes-yes  just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?
Rachel, Oh  Sophie  I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…
Monica,  Umm  I just wanna say  uh  that with a pinch of exictement  a dash of hard work  a dollup of cooperation  we can have the recipe...  Are you gonna kill me?
Ross, Hey!
Ross, I’m sorry I’m late  did I miss anything?
Phoebe, Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. 
Ross, 15?  Your personal best! 
Phoebe, Where were you?
Ross, Oh  on a date. Yeah  I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Chandler, Oh  yeah! How did you meet her?
Phoebe, Oh  which museum?
Phoebe,  No  answer his.
Ross, Okay  it was just me and her at the back of the train  and I sat near the door  so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Chandler, Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Ross, No  I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great  but she’s like totally great  but she lives two and a half hours away.
Chandler, How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
Joey, Done! I did it! Heh  who’s stupid now? 
Chandler, Hey  look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Phoebe, Umm  that paper’s two weeks old.
Chandler, All right  who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this  I can’t believe I missed it.
Rachel, Hey  y’know  at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day  then my birthday  then bang!—before you know it  they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh  I want somebody!  Y’know  I want a man!!  I mean  it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship  y’know  just like a fling would be great.
Chandler, Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Rachel, Well  believe me  it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
Joey, Well  I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.
Chandler, Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office  do you want me to set you up?
Rachel, Yeah! Wait a minute  it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
Chandler, Well  I have a girlfriend  I’m-I’m happy. So  I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Rachel, Okay! No accountants. Oh  and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
Chandler, Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Phoebe, What’s wrong Mon?
Monica, Ohh  everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Phoebe, Oh.
Monica, I thought I was making headway  everyone was smiling at me all day  I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef’s hat. 
Phoebe, Hey  maybe they meant to write  ‘Quiet  bitch.’
Rachel, Hey  honey! What’s the matter?  Fine  I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Monica, I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. 
Joey, Ohhh!
Monica, I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit  and if there were any other job  I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.
Rachel, Well  wait a minute  you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or  fire them?
Monica, I would love too  but I can’t! I mean I just can’t  you know that I’m not good at confrontation.
Chandler, Hey  you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director  I think it was Orson Wells  who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody  just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know  who’s boss.
Joey, Hey  Mon! I’m not doing anything  why don’t you fire me?
Monica, That’s a good idea! Wait  do you know how to waiter?
Joey, Good enough to get fired.
Monica, All right  you’re hired!
Joey, Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Chandler,  Yes.
Chandler, I say  Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op  I’m not asking for me  I’m… I mean… No  I’m-I’m not gay  I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!
Chandler, See my friend-my friend  Rachel  she wants to be set up.
Chandler, Oh  y’know what  that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling  that might be all right with Rachel.
Chandler,  Oh  by the way  that is her full name.
Chandler, Oh well  that’s uh  a little later than I uh  generally care to stay  but sure!
Chandler, Well  I don’t really know what that is  but let’s!!
Phoebe, Hey! You guys  I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Phoebe,  Happy Chanukah  Monica! May your Christmas be snowy  Joey! Happy New Year  Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle  Rachel!
Rachel, Pheebs  that’s great!
Phoebe, Oh  yay!
Rachel, But y’know umm  Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.
Phoebe, I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
Joey, What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
Phoebe, All good  thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?
Monica, Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Rachel, Oh yeah!
Phoebe, Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like  Budolph?
Chandler,  Hello  children!
Chandler,  Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Rachel, Really?!
Chandler, Oh yeah  I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They’re buying me drinks! They’re giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight?
Joey, Sure! Where are the seats?
Chandler, Wherever! I’ve got like 20!
Rachel, So  will I like any of these guys?
Chandler, Y’know what  I’m gonna uh  play the field just a little more.
Rachel, Chandler!
Chandler, Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
Phoebe,  You work with robots!!
Chandler,  Yes.  Okay  there’s this one guy  Patrick  I think you’re gonna like him  he’s really nice  he’s funny  he’s a swimmer.
Rachel, Ohh  I like swimmer’s bodies!
Chandler, Yes  and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Rachel, Op  I like credit cards!
Chandler, See  I’m not bad at this fixing up thing  huh?
Rachel, Well  so what does he do?
Chandler, Oh  he works in the Fine Foods division.
Rachel, Your company has a fine foods division?
Chandler, It’s a big company  I don’t—if you—I…
Joey, Now  wait a second! You make food and robots?
Phoebe, No! No  the robots just work for them.
Monica,  All right  I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Joey, Yeah  lady  I do! I got a problem with that!
Monica, You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
Joey, Oh  what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
Monica, You bet your ass  I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.
Ross, Oh  wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Chandler, Oh yeah! With who?
Ross, You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross, Not her. Yeah  this is someone else I meet  and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie  even though she’s a two hour train ride away  is really pretty  really smart  and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl  well  she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s  well she’s-she’s just as pretty  I guess she’s smart  she’s not fun.
Phoebe, If she’s no fun  why do you want to date her at all?
Ross, Well  I-I want to give her another chance  y’know? She lives so close. And  at the end of the date  the other time  she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand  if she wasn’t kidding  she’s not fun  she’s stupid  and kind of a racist.
Joey,  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey  man!
Phoebe, Hey! Ooh  how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Joey,  Damn! 
Joey,  Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Joey, Hey  what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket? 
Monica, They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight  I’m gonna fire you tonight.
Joey, You got it! Oh-oh! 
Monica, What are you doing?!
Joey, It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.
Monica, Thanks.  I think you got it!
Rachel,  Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Chandler, Well  like father  like son.
Rachel, Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler, Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Rachel, Well  y'know  possibly.  You didn’t tell him that  though? Right?
Chandler, Ummmmmmmm  no.
Rachel, You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!
Chandler, Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
Rachel, Oh  between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh  he’s so gonna get the wrong idea.
Monica, Hey  Joey  could you pass the cheese?
Joey, Yeah. Listen uh  I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here  I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Joey,  There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!
Monica, Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay  first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?
Monica, Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Monica, Okay  forget the specials for a minute. Umm  all right here’s the thing  for the last two weeks I have umm   tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…
Monica,  A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here.  From now on  it is gonna be my way  or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!!  Hey new guy! I said  does anybody have a problem with that?!
Joey, No ma’am.
Monica, What the hell happened?!
Joey," I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand  and I was thinking  ""Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!"""
Monica, Joey  we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!
Joey, And I gotta pay rent! Look  how-how about this? You don’t fire me  instead I stay here  I gain their trust  and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.
Monica, What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey, Well nothing yet  they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Phoebe,  Happy  happy Chanukah  Chandler and Monica. Very merry…
Chandler,  Oh  y’know  y’know what Pheebs?
Phoebe, What?
Chandler, I’m not Jewish  so…
Phoebe, So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss  but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God! 
Chandler, Bad dream?
Ross, I wasn’t sleeping.
Chandler, Oh yeah  then uh  what was Phoebe’s song about?
Ross, The one with the cat. I gotta go  I’ve got another date.
Phoebe, So  did you pick one yet?
Ross, No  it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
Phoebe, Well look  you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie  so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her  and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight  you’re done!
Ross, Y’know  you’re right. Thank you.
Phoebe, Umm  well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Chandler, Prague?
Phoebe, There’s sooo much you don’t know.
Rachel, Chandler! Patrick just uh  ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
Chandler, I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel, You idiot!!
Chandler, I’m sure you’re right  but why?
Rachel, You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Chandler, Oh  man. I’m sorry  I’m so-so sorry.
Rachel, Y’know  you should never be allowed to talk to people!
Chandler, I know! I know!
Rachel, Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww  this sucks! Being alone  sucks! 
Chandler, Well  y’know  you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you  I didn’t have to lie once. 
Rachel, Really?
Chandler, Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude  right?
Rachel, No.
Chandler, Oh  it doesn’t matter.  Hey  y’know what  I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game  you wanna come with me?
Rachel, Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Chandler, Well  actually it’s a hockey team  so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
Rachel, Well that sounds fun too. 
Chandler, Have you ever been with a woman?
Rachel, What?! Chandler  what is the matter with you?!
Chandler, So there is no good time to ask that question.
Monica, I need more swordfish.  Can you get me some more swordfish?
Monica, You did a minute ago!
Monica, Fine!
Monica, Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on  I’m cold!  And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out! 
Monica, That’s not funny.
Monica,  I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef  and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what  if you want me to quit this bad  then all you have to do is…
Joey,  Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Monica, You do?
Joey, You bet I do! I just ah  wasn’t listening then  that’s all.
Monica, Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
Joey, What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
Monica, You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!!  All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
Monica, How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?
Monica, Good! Now  take those salads to table 4   And you! Get the swordfish!  And you! Get a haircut!
Ross,  What? 
Ross, What?
Ross,  Are we really in Montreal?!
Ross, Coffee sounds great.  Wait  so  so you live in Montreal?
Joey, Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Monica, Thanks.
Joey, Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Monica, Enough!
Joey,  Lean-lean-lean!
Phoebe,"  ""Went to the store  sat on Santa's lap."

Chandler, Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster.  We’re getting a second opinion.
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey  what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Rachel, Well  I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
Phoebe, You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
Rachel, Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
Phoebe, All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um  see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
Ross, Now  how will they know if you’re ready?
Phoebe, Oh  they’re just gonna umm  look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Chandler, Oh  I can uh  check that for ya.
Phoebe, Okay everyone  think thick.
Phoebe, Hi! Wish me luck!
Monica, Oh  good luck.
Joey, Good luck.  And I’m still right!
Monica, That is sooo not true!
Rachel, What?
Joey, She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.
Chandler, I can check that for ya.
Monica, I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Chandler, Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Joey, Yeah  what’s that about?
Chandler,  And you… Ross  I believe  if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Ross,  You’re good.  These are not.
Rachel, I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.

Phoebe, Okay  well y’know what  don’t worry you guys  ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.

Rachel, Noooo.
Monica, All right  look  I hate this as much as you  but if it makes you feel better  it’s all your fault.
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Chinadolor Bong  come on  we steal that TV Guide every week!

Monica, I lost our mattresses.
Phoebe,"  ""Are you in there little fetus?"
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
Monica, Hey  don’t mix those up  you could really ruin that lollipop.
Phoebe, All right  I will. No  I will. But umm  y’know just remember that it’s still really early  okay so  if it says that I’m not pregnant  that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant  okay and  and just please  just so I don’t go completely nuts  just try not put all your hopes on this.
Phoebe, Great. 
Rachel, Y’know what  you are mean boys  who are just being mean!
Joey, Hey  don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica, Hey  we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Rachel, Well it stupid  unfair question!
Ross, Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler, Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Rachel, Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Joey, But it is our apartment!
Rachel, No it’s not!
Phoebe, You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!
Phoebe, Okay  but this can’t be good for the baby.
Monica, I can’t find garbage bags!
Rachel, Oh  I think I saw some in here.
Monica, What is it?!
Rachel, I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut  it’ll die.
Monica, I can’t believe we’re living here!
Chandler, What?! What-what is it?!
Joey, Did you see the size of the closets?!
Chandler, I can’t believe we live here!

Chandler, You!
Joey, It’s the chick! She’s…going through some changes.
Monica, What kind of changes?
Chandler, Well the vet seems to think that’s she’s becoming a rooster.  We’re getting a second opinion.
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey  what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Rachel, Well  I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
Phoebe, You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
Rachel, Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
Phoebe, All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um  see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
Ross, Now  how will they know if you’re ready?
Phoebe, Oh  they’re just gonna umm  look to see if my endometria layer is thick.
Chandler, Oh  I can uh  check that for ya.
Phoebe, Okay everyone  think thick.
Phoebe, Hi! Wish me luck!
Monica, Oh  good luck.
Joey, Good luck.  And I’m still right!
Monica, That is sooo not true!
Rachel, What?
Joey, She’s mad because I know today’s her laundry day and that means she’s wearing her old lady underpants.
Chandler, I can check that for ya.
Monica, I just—I can’t believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Chandler, Well… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Joey, Yeah  what’s that about?
Chandler,  And you… Ross  I believe  if you check Rachel’s bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Ross,  You’re good.  These are not.
Rachel, I’m so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Monica, Yeah.
Joey, Oh yeah? Ross  how many items left in that bag?

Ross," Oh sure  ""Ross will do it!"" It’s not like he has a job  or a child  or a life of his own."
Rachel, Fine! We’ll ask Phoebe.
Ross, No-no-no  I-I wanna play.
Phoebe, Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Phoebe," Embryossss? As in  ""More than one?"""
Phoebe, Five? Okay  where am I giving birth  a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Phoebe, That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Phoebe, Okay  well y’know what  don’t worry you guys  ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Phoebe, Whoa!! That—okay  that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.  So  well okay  so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?

Chandler, I majored in lightning rounds. All right  we’re gonna destroy you.

Chandler, Well  I’m so confused as to what we’ve been doing so far…

Rachel, Oh my God.
Joey, I call Monica’s room!
Chandler, You can’t just call Monica’s room.
Joey, Sure I can  standard shotgun rules  I’m sight of the room and I called it.
Monica, Man  I feel like I’m coming down with something.
Joey, What?
Monica, Yeah.  I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!
Chandler, Oh  I would never bet this apartment. It’s too nice.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey—ooh Pheebs  are they in there?
Phoebe, Umm  yeah  uh-huh  they’re implanted.
Monica, How do you feel?
Phoebe, Well  freaked. ‘Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alice’s like only shot. Like  they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.
Chandler, Yeah  but I bet it works.
Monica, Really?! How much?!
Phoebe, All right  I’m gonna go take a pregnancy test  right now.

Rachel, What?!
Monica, Chinadolor Bong  come on  we steal that TV Guide every week!
Chandler, I knew it!
Rachel, I don’t care  I’m not going anywhere.
Chandler, Cool  girl roommate.
Monica, Well?
Phoebe, Nope  not knocked up yet.
Monica, It’s only been a couple of hours  so just give it some time.
Phoebe, Yeah  all right. Meanwhile  I’m gonna do whatever I can to help this so  I’m just gonna y’know  lie it your chair   Y'know? Yeah  good  I’m let gravity y’know  do its jobs.
Monica, Hey  Rach  can you give me a hand with this box?
Rachel, No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment  it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look  and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you  you with the steady hand  I am not moving  and now I have got the steady hand. 
Monica, I’ll take care of it.
Rachel, That’s right! You do what the hand says!
Rachel, How did it go?
Monica, I lost our mattresses.
Phoebe,"  ""Are you in there little fetus?"
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
Monica, Hey  don’t mix those up  you could really ruin that lollipop.
Phoebe, All right  I will. No  I will. But umm  y’know just remember that it’s still really early  okay so  if it says that I’m not pregnant  that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant  okay and  and just please  just so I don’t go completely nuts  just try not put all your hopes on this.
Phoebe, Great. 
Rachel, Y’know what  you are mean boys  who are just being mean!
Joey, Hey  don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica, Hey  we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Rachel, Well it stupid  unfair question!
Ross, Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler, Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Rachel, Will you stop calling it your apartment!
Joey, But it is our apartment!
Rachel, No it’s not!
Phoebe, You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!
Phoebe, Okay  but this can’t be good for the baby.
Monica, I can’t find garbage bags!
Rachel, Oh  I think I saw some in here.
Monica, What is it?!
Rachel, I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut  it’ll die.
Monica, I can’t believe we’re living here!
Chandler, What?! What-what is it?!
Joey, Did you see the size of the closets?!
Chandler, I can’t believe we live here!
Chandler, Okay  she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Ross, People can hear you.
Chandler, I know!!
Chandler, Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, That is one good looking man!
Chandler, Is it just me  or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Ross, Dude!
Ross, Here’s your girlfriend’s button. 
Phoebe, Oh  hey  Mon  do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Monica, Yeah  I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Phoebe, Well  it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.
Monica, Hey  Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.
Rachel, Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. 
Monica, Oh my God  are you out of a job?
Rachel, No  but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Phoebe, Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, That sounds great!
Joey,  Hey! 
Monica, Umm  excuse me  we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore  that-that gravy train had ended.
Joey,  There’s gravy?
Monica, If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked  okay  that’s your department now. 
Monica, What are you doing?
Joey, I think I left a donut up here.
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?
Ross, Well  Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.
Chandler, Yeah  it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Phoebe, That’s a good idea for a business!
Chandler," I’m totally screwed. Okay  they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night  and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like  ""So where’s your boyfriend  what’s-his-name  Chester?"" And she’ll go  ""No-no-no  it’s Chandler."" And he’ll go  ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Joey,  That-that is a good trick.
Chandler, All right  look  look  what am I gonna do?
Joey, Chandler  look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job  just ‘cause they work together  doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins  it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.
Ross, Oh-oh  Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Joey, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe, Hey  Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Ross, They’re not a couple!
Phoebe, Oh-okay  I get the game now.
Joey, Okay look  look  let me ask you a question  when they were doing it on stage  was it like really hot?
Ross, Oh yeah!
Joey, Well okay  so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away  that’s when you’re in trouble.
Chandler, Really?
Joey, Look  you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in  have I ever had chemistry on stage?
Ross, No.
Joey, Noooo!!
Chandler, So uh  man  are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Ross, Y’know what  I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Chandler, Yeah  I know but…
Ross, Oh no-no-no  I’m there.
Monica,  Hey!
Joey, Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica, You made pancakes?
Joey, Yep! Grab a plate.
Monica, Okay. 
Joey, No-no  stay right there.  Gettin’ closer.
Chandler, Okay  okay  but don’t worry  because we also have cereals  muffins  waffles  and  jams  jellies  and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.
Joey, Listen also we’re uh  we’re watching the game here Saturday night  if people want to come over.
Ross, Oh yeah!
Monica, Oh  I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Joey, Oh yeah  who’s playing?
Monica, The players.
Ross, Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Monica,  Please  it’s a relief is what it is  is what it is.
Joey, All right Pheebs  stick out your plate!
Phoebe, Oh. 
Rachel,  Monica  I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!  Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye  call me when you get this message.  Oh! Mr. Waltham  I ah really need to talk to you.
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Hi  I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?
Rachel, Oh  I’m so sorry.
Rachel, Well  at least that’s a great suit.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, No-no  that wasn’t me!  Well  we should get started. Let me show you my underwear.  The selection of underwear we carry.
Rachel, Oh-oh  sorry  it’s this way  it’s this way. 
Chandler, I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat  and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means  Joey told us what this means!
Ross, All right  let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Chandler, Come on  it was like cousins having sex up there!
Ross, Here she comes. Don’t say a word  okay? Just be cool  don’t be…y'know you.
Ross, Hey!
Ross, Oh  absolutely! 
Chandler, Oh  I loved the play. You were great  and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.
Ross, Okay  I… 
Chandler, Oh come on  it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Chandler, Y’know  I-I could see how this could happen  y'know you’re up there every night  you’re naked  touching  kissing.
Chandler, Well  you can understand  given how we started.
Chandler, Well  that is what happened  and I don’t even see you denying this!
Chandler, Yeah  well  don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!
Rachel, I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today  and I got to dress him up all day!
Phoebe, Rachel has a new doll.
Rachel, Oh  I wish he was a doll  then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name  I never realised it  Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Ross, Uh  hello!
Rachel, Hi-e!!
Phoebe, Ooh  what do I smell?
Joey, I don’t know  it smells good.
Monica, Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Phoebe, Ooh! 
Monica, Please  have some!
Ross, Oh  yumm!
Monica, Yeah  I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Joey,  Wow! The new Playboy!
Monica, Yeah  it’s just something I picked up.
Ross, Cookies and porn  you’re the best mom ever!!
Phoebe, What? What?
Rachel, Well  it was just something Josh said about v-necks  but you had to be there.
Ross, Yeah  how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Rachel, It’s Joshua.
Ross, Oh  whatever. 
Monica, Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!
Phoebe,  Well  I hate to eat and run  but…
Monica, No  wait  please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!
Phoebe, Yeah  I don’t need it.
Monica, People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Rachel, Why? Honey  what is the big deal?
Monica, I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean  I was always the hostess  I mean even when I was little  I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party  I-I served the best air.
Phoebe, Well  why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know  everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Monica, ‘Cause they took our apartment  I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.
Phoebe, If you wanted to punish them  you should’ve just made them hang out here!
Rachel, Yeah  that’s true.
Monica, All right then  when I’m done with this place  it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!
Phoebe, Oh  are we gonna trash that place?
Chandler, Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Ross, So you were right?
Chandler, I confronted her  and she didn’t deny it!  I don’t live here! 
Ross, Chandler!
Rachel, Chandler  what did she say?
Phoebe, Wait a minute.
Joey, Come here.
Monica, Are you sure?
Chandler, Well  I may be drunk  but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
Rachel, Beefsteak Charlie’s?
Chandler, Yes! See you and I have always been like—
Rachel, Whoops.  Oh  hey  do you need help with that?
Monica, Nah  I got it.
Rachel, Ooh  I just feel bad  I never vacuum. 
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, So I was with Joshua for an hour today  and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!
Phoebe, Why don’t you ask him out?
Joey, Oh  yeah  totally! That’s such a turn-on!
Rachel, Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?
Joey, Oh-ooh  that’s the turn-on.
Phoebe, He just got a divorce right?
Rachel, Hmm-mmm.
Phoebe, So he’s probably really nervous around women  y'know? Maybe  you just have to make the first move.
Rachel, Yeah but  I’ve never asked a guy out before.
Phoebe,  You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
Rachel, No. Have you?
Phoebe, Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
Rachel, I don’t even know how I would go about it.
Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh  how I do it is  I look a woman up and down and say  ""Hey  how you doin’?"""
Phoebe, Oh  please!
Joey,  Hey  how you doin’?
Rachel, You know what  I’m gonna do that  I’m gonna call him up  and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  How you doin’?  Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s.  Yeah  umm  I was wondering if you umm  if you umm  left your wallet at the store today? Well  we found a wallet  and we— the license? Well  that is a good idea! Uh  well  let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh  uh  belongs to a mister uh  Pheebs  and umm  yeah  so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye.   You’ve done that a thousand times?
Phoebe, I’ve never done that.
Rachel, Ohh  God  I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Joey, Well  you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh  Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game  you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!
Rachel, Really?! You think that will work?
Joey, Absolutely! And if it doesn’t  can I get the extra ticket?
Joey, What the heck is that?
Chandler, Did she call?
Phoebe, No  sorry.
Chandler, All right  maybe I should call her.
Joey, No! Forget her  man! You don’t need her  you don’t need that!
Ross, He’s right  what she did was unforgivable.
Chandler, Well  yeah  but y'know  what-what if I was wrong?
Ross, How might you be wrong?
Chandler, Well y'know  what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?
Joey, Dude  tell me she actually told you this.
Chandler, She did not have to tell me  I saw the play  and there was no heat. Back me up here  Ross!
Ross, That’s all you’re basing this on?
Chandler, That’s not backing me up! Look  you said with the off-stage and the heat  and the onstage and the oy heat.
Joey, Whoa-whoa  that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Chandler, Oh my God!!
Rachel, Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?  You know  its funny  basketball  because I happen to have tickets too…  Umm  who likes the Knicks—
Rachel, Oh! Well  as a single woman  who is available  I think you look great!
Rachel, Yep. Oh  yeah  look you great.  Oh yeah. Yeah  this looks great.  Umm  so you like it?
Rachel, Great.
Rachel, Sure.
Rachel, Yeah-eah-ha!
Rachel, Oh well  you don’t want to do that now?!
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Basketball!
Rachel, I uh  I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested  just as a thank you for this week.
Rachel, Really?
Chandler, Hey. I just  I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world  and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Chandler, Yeah  I know  I-I wish I had too  but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight  and now we can move on. Y’know  I know for me— Nick’s pants?
Chandler, Yeah. Well  I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Joey, Okay  for next time  what do you say?
Rachel, I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not  two tickets  I have an extra ticket.
Ross, So the first time you ask a guy out  he-he turns you down?
Rachel, He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date  I’m just not on it!
Monica,  Okay  it’s ready. Come on.
Joey, What’s ready?
Monica, Just come.
Ross, Oh my God!
Rachel, Wow! Monica!
Phoebe, Great!
Ross, This is beautiful!
Phoebe, Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
Monica, Pretty much.  So  what do you  what do you think of the floor?
Joey, I don’t know  it looks the same.
Monica, You used to have carpet.
Joey, Oh yeah!
Monica, So I made snacks. Please  just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Ross, Look  Mon  do you want us to uh  come back later?
Monica, Oh no-no-no  stay  stay  stay  just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.
Ross, Hey!
Joey, How’d it go?
Chandler, Well  she wasn’t sleeping with him.
Phoebe, Oh good!
Chandler, She is now.
Ross, What are you saying?
Chandler, I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick  with his rock hard pecs  and his giant man-nipples! I hate him  I hate her! Well  I don’t hate her  I love her. This is all my fault really.
Phoebe, How? How is your fault?
Chandler, Because  I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big  stupid fight  she never would’ve gone out with Nick  and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
Rachel, Honey  this is not your fault  just because you guys had a fight  it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Ross, Well  if-if she thought they were on a break…
Rachel, Really?
Rachel, Yes! I will! Absolutely!  Hello  Rachel. Hi  Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes  I just wanted to see you again. Oh  I’m glad. Rachel  I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
Phoebe,  So now  what is this now?
Joey, Guggly worm.
Phoebe,  And this?
Joey, Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Phoebe,  You make it so funny.
Monica,  Hey umm  what’s this?
Joey,  Ohh  a hunk of sandwich from last year. 
Ross,  Ohh  Geller’s got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah  ohh! Ohh!  It’s the classic struggle between man and— Someone knocked over a lamp.
Joey,"  That’s all right. Hey you guys  you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that  ""Joey  what are you doing with your life?"" stuff. I can say  ""Well  I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"""
Chandler, You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.  Well  except you. 
Monica, Hey  Joey  I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
Joey, Look  there’s nothing I can do for him right now  he’s still in his sweat pants  that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two  I would never miss Phase Two.
Monica, What’s Phase Two?
Joey, Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.
Rachel, How does going to a strip club help him better?
Ross, Because there are naked ladies there.
Joey, Which helps him get to Phase Three  picturing yourself with other women.
Ross, There are naked ladies there too.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler,  Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Rachel, Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.
Rachel, Yeah!
Rachel, Oh  okay. Uhh  well let’s see.  You’re about—well uh  this one is large. And this one—
Rachel, Yeah! Okay  two larges coming right up!
Rachel, Yes.
Rachel, Sure. You got it. Great!
Rachel, Me  Fledermaus  great. I really—
Rachel, So? 
Rachel, Ohh! Right! Right  sorry  I’ll be right back!
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, No! Nothing!
Rachel, Yeah! That would be great!
Rachel,  Well  I-I guess—I…
Rachel, Yeah  great  you betcha!
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Oh. Oh  right.
Rachel, Oh yay!
Chandler, Y’know  I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really  thought that she was the one. I tell you what  from now on I’m never getting out of this chair  ever! Okay? From now on  this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!
Ross, Come on  man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.
Joey,  Hey-hey!
Ross, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Catch any big fish? 
Joey, Oh my God  you guys have no idea.
Monica, You stink!
Ross, Are you kidding?!
Joey, Yeah  three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey  how-how’s he doing?
Ross, He hasn’t gotten out of that chair in two days.
Joey,  Hey buddy! How’s it going?
Joey,  Hey  see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right  uh  I’ve got to go memorise my lines.  Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!
Rachel,  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  Monica!
Monica, Uh-oh  what’s the matter?
Rachel, Ohh  it’s Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight. But  I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to this dumb old opera. So… What are you gonna do?
Monica, I don’t know sweetie.
Rachel, No! Help me!
Monica, I can’t! I have to work!
Rachel, Phoebe?
Phoebe, I would  but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Rachel, Ugh!
Phoebe, Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Rachel," Ohh  gosh. You guys  come on  this is—I have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Y’know the ""Wouldn’t it be great if she was my wife"" Rachel. Ohh  all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?"
Monica, No  Chandler’s still in Phase One  and Joey’s that thing you smell.
Rachel, Ohh!  Hi!
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, So….
Ross, No.
Rachel, Ohhhh  come on!!!
Monica, I think she’s here.
Rachel, No! Wait! Wait-wait! Ross  please!
Ross, You want me to take some girl I’ve never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy  hmm  that-that is a toughie.
Monica,  Ohh  she’s looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait  you can’t see people through that little hole  can you?  Hello!
Rachel, I’ll be right there!  Okay  Ross  please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought we’ve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?
Ross, All right  I’ll do it.
Rachel, Oh thank you! Thank you  thank you  thank you!  Emily?
Rachel, I’m Rachel Green.
Rachel, There’s been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I’m not free tonight. So…
Rachel, Oh well  no I…
Monica, I-I-I think you look great.
Rachel, I’ll get her.
Ross, Please hurry.
Phoebe, Don’t you just love the way they talk?!
Phoebe, Ohh!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, It kicked! I think the baby kicked!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Oh no wait  oh no  the elastic on my underwear busted.
Joey,  Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Monica, Oh wait  Joey  you can’t go like that! You stink!
Joey, Look  I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time! They’re just ten blocks away  if I run  I can make it.
Monica, Yeah. Run ten blocks  that’ll help the smell.
Rachel, Hey—whoa  slow down.  No  keep moving.  Wow!
Monica, So? How did it go with Joshua last night?
Rachel, Well  I didn’t see Joshua last night  but I did punch a girl in the face.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Why?
Rachel, The whole night was horrible  it was pouring down rain  and when I got there  there was no Rachel Green on the list  but there was a Rachel Greep.
Phoebe, Ohh! So  did you get to meet her?
Rachel," No  there is no Rachel Greep  but then this other girl overheard us and she was all  ""I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!"" and he let her right in."
Monica, So you hit her in the face?
Rachel, No  she was already in  but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella  so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this  all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua  so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Phoebe,  Aww  Pheebs.
Rachel, Honey  that’s you’re name.
Phoebe, That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!
Monica, Hey! You’re wearing pants!
Chandler, That’s right! Where are the guys? I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Monica, It’s 9:30 in the morning!
Chandler, They got a breakfast buffet.
Monica, Hello.  Oh  hey Ross!
Chandler, Ooh  let me talk to him!
Monica, Oh-oh  my God!
Chandler, Well  can I just…
Monica,  Shh!!  Wait  what?
Chandler, She’s shhing me! It’s my phone and she’s shhing me!
Phoebe, Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?
Monica, He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
Phoebe, What? Oh my God!
Rachel, What? Who the hell is Emily— noooo!!
Rachel, They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?! 
Chandler, Ow!
Rachel, How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! 
Chandler, Maybe  she doesn’t hit him all the time.
Ross, When we first met her  she was soaking  her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes  she was a totally different person.
Ross, I’ve gotta go  there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard! 
Monica, He had to go  there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
Rachel, I don’t get this! She was horrible! 
Chandler, Okay  I’m going to go stand over there. 
Monica, Why do you care so much anyway?
Rachel, I don’t care! All right  y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still  you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Monica, Well  when you first met Barry  you flitted off to Vail.
Rachel, Oh  y’know  would you just for once  not remember every…little…thing!! 
Chandler, So y’know  uh  when’s he getting back?
Monica, A couple of days.
Chandler, Y’know  I knew something like this was going to happen. 
Monica, What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!
Chandler, Yes you can. You’re thinking about time  you can’t go back in time.
Phoebe, Well  look  why don’t you just  why don’t you do your Phase Two strip club thing with us.
Monica, Yeah  come on  we can be guys!
Chandler,  No you can’t.
Phoebe, Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!
Chandler, You don’t want to be guys  you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long. 
Phoebe, Y’know you  you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Chandler, Okay. 
Phoebe, I’m sorry. 
Joey,  Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!
Joey, Look at that  Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!
Joey,  Whoa! Yeah  what the hell is that? What smells so bad?
Joey, Y’know  I can see why you think that  but ah  actually  you know who I think it is?
Joey, No-no  it’s uh  it’s Heston.
Joey, Yeah  the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
Joey, Really  a shower huh? And uh  which-which room might that be?
Joey, Interesting.
Monica,  Okay  I’ve got some Ones  you wanna put them in her panties?
Chandler, No thanks  Mom!
Phoebe, Oh  no umm  hi  that-that  you have to put that out  ‘cause I’m pregnant.
Phoebe, Ha-ha  it’s not my baby  ha-ha-ha! 
Monica, Very good   so good.
Phoebe,  I really  really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Rachel,  Well  I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh  you know what makes it so much worse  Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Phoebe, Come on! Look where you are!!
Monica,  When you get a sec  another round of daiquiris.
Phoebe, Remember  a virgin for me please.
Monica, Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Chandler, Ahh  come on! Y’know what—y’know what  I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Phoebe, Well  if you think it will help.
Chandler, No! That was a test! In a couple of hours I’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that  I’m gonna get so drunk  I’m gonna wanna call Janice
Phoebe, You should! How is she?
Chandler, Ohhh!!
Monica, I think somebody needs another lap dance. 
Joey, How ya doin’?
Joey, I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas  huh?
Joey, No-no-no  no  no  wait. You see  I’m an actor  Joey Tribbiani  I’m doing a scene with you today  and well  I stink.
Joey, Yeah-yeah  I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway  look  I’m really sorry  but I stink!
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Oh no-no-no  you don’t understand…
Joey, Oh yeah  yeah.
Joey, Yes sir! Yes sir  I’m-I’m—
Joey, Yeah. Oh  yeah.
Monica, So  we did okay at the strip club  right?
Chandler, Oh yeah  that was great. Thanks to you  the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
Rachel,  I can’t believe it! He still hasn’t called.
Phoebe, Who  Josh?
Rachel, It’s Joshua.
Monica, What  he doesn’t like Josh?
Rachel, No  I don’t.
Chandler, All right  well I’m gonna put my sweats back on.
Phoebe, Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay  y’know what  you were right  you were right. We really weren’t great at being guys  but you know why? Because we’re girls.
Chandler, Yeah?
Phoebe, And do you know what girls are really good at?
Chandler, Stripping!
Phoebe, No  listening! Sit! Y’know  maybe it would just really  really help if you would just talk.
Rachel, Yeah  come on! What’s going in on in there? 
Monica, Yeah. And y’know  if you wanna cry  that’s okay too.
Chandler, Okay  look  I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Monica, Come on! Chandler!
Chandler, Look  forget it. We tried  but Phase Three is a lost cause  Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot  and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them. 
Monica, They really were pretty  weren’t they? 
Phoebe, Yeah  I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Monica, Oh  Candy! She was so spunky!
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, Y’know  I think if I were going to be with a woman.  It’d  it’d be with someone like Michelle  she was so oh  she was so petite.
Rachel, See  I don’t know  for me it would have to Chantal.
Monica, Oh  Chantal!
Rachel, Oh my goodness  she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
Chandler,  Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Monica, Really?!
Chandler, I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Monica, That’s-that’s not Phase Three.
Chandler, Well  I’m there too!
Rachel, Well  are we all together? Like in a group?
Chandler, Stop it! You’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Phoebe, Oh! What is that? What is that?
Chandler, Where I don’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Chandler, Come on  let me see that smile.
Joey, I don’t wanna.
Chandler, Please?
Joey, I wanted to go to the strip club!
Chandler, I know  I know  but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.
Joey, Yeah  all right. 
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey—ooh so  how was Vermont?
Ross, Emily is…incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it  I mean the whole weekend was like a dream.  Oh! And you! Rach!
Rachel, Oh  hey!
Ross, Hey! You were so right!
Rachel, What?
Ross, Uh  what you said  about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.
Rachel, Oh  hmm.
Ross, I mean  I  I-I admit I-I wasn’t quite there. Y’know  I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy…
Rachel, Joshua.
Ross, Joshua…guy at that club  dancing and having a good time  the thought of it kinda…y’know.
Rachel, Yeah  I…
Ross, But now! I’m there! I’m totally there! I’m-I’m finally where you are!
Rachel, Oh  thank goodness!
Ross, Yeah  and-and thank you for Emily.
Rachel, Oh  no problem. I’m so glad I could help. Happy for you. 
Ross, Happy for you. 
Rachel, No  happy for you! 
Chandler," All right ladies  here’s what we’re gonna do.  You are gonna take off my clothes.  You two  go get the oils.  And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice  ""Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!"""
Phoebe, I-I wanna be with her   I like her.
Chandler, Oh  that’s fine! Go with your instincts  go with your instincts.
Monica, Wait  now  what am I doing again?
Chandler, Come on! Would you please pay attention  I could wake up at any moment!
Rachel, No-no-no  that’ not Joshua.
Chandler, What do you want from me  I’ve never met the guy. So anyway  Rachel  I’m sorry you can’t stay   but the rest of us have a lot of work to do.  What are you doing?  All right  listen  I’ve got to wake up!
Chandler, Y'know  I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun!  Which it kinda is.  Also  you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Rachel, Chandler  there’s a guy right over there. 
Chandler, That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman!   Hi. How are ya?
Rachel, Chandler  don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!  That does!  What am I sitting on?  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Chandler, Hey  you know who used to have nails like that?
Rachel, Hmm.
Monica, Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Joey, Ohh  Nothing.
Monica, Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
Joey, I know what it did! Nothing.
Monica, They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?
Joey, Like this. 
Rachel, Well  here’s another question for ya. Uhh  do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
Joey, Sure! It flushes it.
Rachel, Okay  good. Now that since you know  when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Chandler,  Hello!
Joey, Hey!  Ah!! 
Rachel, Guess who we ran into today?!
Monica, Janice?!
Chandler, Isn’t this amazing?
Monica, How have you been?
Phoebe, Ohhh  wow.
Joey, And there it is.
Chandler, Okay. Bye.
Chandler, Bye.
Chandler, Bye.
Chandler, B-bye!
Chandler, Bye.   I can’t stand the woman! 
Phoebe, What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Chandler, Yeah  I know  but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice  her laugh  her personality—Well  they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!
Joey, So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!
Chandler, Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight. 
Rachel, You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Chandler,  Well  I don’t have to break up with her this time. We’re not involved! I’m going to do a pre-emptive strike! I’m going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! 
Joey, Yeah  try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  I’m tellin’ ya!
Ross, No  it’s really not that bad. I mean  I-I for one  feel perfectly safe.
Ross, Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Ross, Oh hey  that was a good one  huh?  Help! Help!
Ross, Oh  Liam. So uh  what  were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it  football?
Ross, What’s ah  what’s so funny about that?
Ross, Well  we didn’t have freedom here until 1776  either so…
Ross, Cheers!
Chandler, Yes  I-I know that you do  but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though  was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Chandler,  Okay  we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
Chandler, Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Chandler, I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately  my company is transferring me overseas!
Chandler, No! No! Not  Paris.
Chandler, Okay  could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right  yes  I’m being transferred to Yemen!
Chandler, I don’t know exactly.
Chandler, But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
Monica, Done?
Phoebe, Yep!
Rachel,  Hey!
Joey, Hey! What’s up?
Monica, This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now  four of them don’t work. Which means  one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So  I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise  so that way  when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
Joey,  I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel, Y’know  you-you also could’ve used uh  lamps and then followed the light.
Monica, Yeah  well  I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So  is everybody ready? Here we go.  I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? 
Rachel, It’s coming from Joey!
Phoebe, Oh my God  that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!
Phoebe, Ooh  hey  could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Ross, Oh  just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
Joey, Dude  you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe,  Janice.
Chandler, Y’know uh  you didn’t really have to help me pack.
Chandler, Well  I-I thought I did but  I-I guess I did not!
Joey, Hey-hey  what’s going on?
Chandler, Oh  I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Joey, Thanks for telling me!
Chandler, I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen  it’s the only way I can get rid off her.
Joey, Ohhhh  good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Phoebe, Yeah  I know  I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.
Chandler,  Okay.  Joey  trade lives with me!
Joey, Nope.  Man look at this! Ross  I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Ross, Hey  I can handle it! All right?
Rachel, Please  Ross  you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Ross, That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
Joey,  Okay  Ross  look-look-look-look  look right here. That’s called a scrum  okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.
Ross, And is a hum  kinda like a scruddle?
Joey, Ross!  They’re gonna kill you!
Phoebe, Well  why are you doing this anyway?
Ross, Well  you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean  he’s like Joe Rugby.
Phoebe, You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
Ross, Anyway  she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
Rachel,  I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right  you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.
Joey, All right  come on look  Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!
Chandler,  Thanks!
Ross, Look  don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh  I’ll be that guy right out of the circle. 
Rachel, Oh  well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
Joey, Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy   and that guy . And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!
Ross, They don’t look any bigger than me!
Joey, Well  maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
Ross, All right.
Phoebe,  Hi.
Phoebe, Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
Ross, Okay  I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know  Red Ross!
Joey, I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.
Ross, Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Joey, No.
Ross, You’ll see.
Ross, JOEY!!!!!!
Rachel, You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today  and guess what happened?
Monica, He asked you out?!
Rachel, No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Monica, Saucy!
Rachel,  What are these?
Monica, Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel, Okay  okay  okay should I be scared?
Monica, I know that switch does something  okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Rachel, Wow! If only more people knew.
Chandler, Y’know you  really didn’t have to take me to the airport.
Chandler, Well  we’re really not that close.  Okay  so I guess this is uh  good-bye then.
Chandler, Okay. Then I guess it’s just  wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  no. No  no  no  I just  I just need a pretend ticket.
Chandler, What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Chandler, No. All right  y’know what  she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card  but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Chandler,  American Express?
Phoebe, No offence but  y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you  y’know with the accent  so…
Ross, Did you see me? I was pretty good  huh? That is one fun game!
Ross,  Hey  could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Ross, Thanks.  I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
Phoebe, Oh  poor baby.
Ross,  Tell my son that I love him.  Excellent! Well  okay  I gotta have some more fun!
Ross,  That’s not true!
Phoebe, She’s right! You have to stop!
Ross, What? No! No  I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
Joey, Dude  if you go back out there  you’re gonna be Dead Ross!
Ross, I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Ross, No  God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Ross, I like that.
Ross, Huh?
Ross, All right  bad ankle  got it!
Ross, Yeah? I can use that  trick hip  no cup  okay! Okay!
Ross, But-but  Liam’s on my team.
Ross, I’m gonna go get him! Okay  I am going back in! 
Joey, The Red Ross! Okay.
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, Hi!
Rachel,  What-what are-what are these?
Monica, Oh  just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?
Monica, No-no-no  no!
Monica, I know that there’s no hole there  I just really liked that picture.
Rachel, Oh my God! Look at this!
Monica, Okay  but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Rachel, I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Monica, I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Rachel, And did you?!
Monica, No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there  I thought it went downstairs.
Monica, But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel, Oh my God.
Rachel, Hello  Mrs. Chatracus.
Phoebe, Now  are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?
Ross, Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet  it’s in my pocket.
Joey, Yeah  sure.
Ross, No  not you. 
Joey, Uhh  look  your eye’s still popping out a little  I’m gonna go get some ice.
Phoebe, Ooh  ice! I am so in the mood for ice! 
Ross, Oh  I kinda was  wasn’t I?
Ross, I made a man twice my size cry. I mean  I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
Ross, Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men  I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but  I really am. And it’s all because of you  wonderful  amazing you.
Ross, No  no  I’m serious. Thank you.
Ross, It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what  you know what? It’s not.
Chandler, Well  I-I guess I gotta go.
Chandler, Well  just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Chandler, Okay  good-bye. Good-bye.
Chandler, No!
Chandler, Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss  and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Chandler, Well  I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen  can I stay with you?
Monica, All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
Rachel, Thank God.
Monica, I guess Joey was right  it does nothing.
Phoebe, See? I’m doing it. I am totally doing it.  I lost it.
Monica, What is it hon?
Phoebe, I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you  being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!  No.
Monica, Aww  honey I’m sorry.
Phoebe, God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh! 
Chandler, Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Joey, Yeah?
Phoebe, It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat  what-what smells so good?
Joey, Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.
Phoebe,  No!
Joey, Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?
Phoebe, Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
Joey, Oh  wait-wait!  Maybe it’s a pickle?!
Chandler, What are you writing?
Rachel, Well  Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out  I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Chandler, Oh yeah?  Joshua  give me a call sometime  guys like you  never go out of style—what did you throw away?
Chandler, Hi guys!
Joey, Hey  what have you guys been up too?
Ross, Oh  we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Chandler, Without me?!
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, I don’t know how museums work in England but  here  you’re not supposed to take stuff.
Ross, Bye. 
Joey, Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Ross, Oh yeah  she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her  I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She’s leaving in two days  I don’t have to do it.
Monica, Oh no  two days  you must be bummed.
Ross, Yeah  she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together  and that’s it. Y’know.
Joey, Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.
Chandler, Yes  but in Ross’s case  they both know in two weeks that’s it.
Ross, Pheebs!
Ross,  Hello! Hello!
Phoebe,  Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it  I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat  y’know? And I got nauseous.
Chandler, Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!
Phoebe, Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Joey, Hey  but at least you got that cool  pregnant lady glow.
Phoebe, That’s sweat. You throw up all morning  you’ll have that glow too.
Rachel, Oh  here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
Rachel, Yeah?
Rachel,  Oh no-no  no-no  they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Rachel, Well  that’s because of a lot of…
Rachel, I know!
Rachel, Oh?
Rachel, Well  congratulations  so do you love her?
Rachel, Huh. Well  uh  that’s uh  that’s interesting. 
Rachel, Oh  it’s just an anti-theft device.
Rachel, You need that  you need that too ‘cause obviously  a thief could just tear this up. 
Rachel, Oops  sorry. Listen  we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually  we have to have one in five minutes  so everybody cancel your plans.
Chandler, What are you talking about?
Joey, Yeah  what’ going on?
Rachel, We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.  Look  he said he’s not ready to date  so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work  and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! 
Ross, Well  as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him  Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean  she’s going to come by first to say good-bye  and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry  no party.
Joey, Awwww!
Rachel, Surprise!!!
Rachel, Well  it was all Ross’s idea.
Ross, You really didn’t know?
Chandler, Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? 
Rachel, Uhh  because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh  quick he’s looking over here  say something funny.
Chandler, Like what?
Joey, What-what-what is so funny?
Chandler," I said  ""Like what?"""
Joey, Now that’s a thinker.
Rachel, Okay  y’know what  y’know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm  hand-hand me those cherries.  Okay. Okay.  Hi!
Rachel, Care for a cherry?
Rachel, No? Y’know  I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
Ross,  So we should probably get going soon.
Ross, Yeah  but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know  then The Plaza for dinner.
Ross," No-no-no  no  umm  actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually  ""Surprise!"" And then  ""Oh my God  I’m so surprised—good-bye!"""
Ross, Monica said that did she? 
Phoebe, Ooh  yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
Joey, A little salami.
Phoebe, Ooh yeah! Then umm  what goes on top of the salami?
Joey, Pastrami.
Phoebe, Oooh  yeah. You’re a genius.
Rachel, Oh  could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
Joey, Yeah. 
Rachel, Up!
Monica, You changed?
Rachel, Yeah  I did. I needed my lucky dress.
Monica, And lucky means  more cleavage?
Chandler, Does for me.
Rachel, Ohh  God! Look at him  he’s so cute. I wanna go over there  grab him  and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
Joey, Oh! I know how you can get him  take off your bra.
Rachel, What?
Joey, There was a seen in Footloose...
Chandler, Flashdance.
Joey, Yeah-yeah  yeah  with that-that uh  plumber girl…
Chandler, She was a welder.
Joey, What? Were you like in the movie  or… Anyway  she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy  and classy.
Monica, Or if you want to kiss him  umm  you could use mistletoe.
Rachel, It’s not Christmas!
Monica, Or Spin the Bottle?
Rachel, He’s not 11!
Rachel, What? You’re leaving?!
Ross, Yes  we have something we have to get to.
Rachel, No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay  we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Ross, What big thing?
Rachel,  So  Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle  it lands on Gunther  so I would have to kiss Gunther.  All right. Who wants to go first?
Joey, Welcome to America. 
Monica, Two in a row! You’ve got to use your tongues now! 
Rachel, Yay! Emily!
Chandler, What are the odds? What are the odds?
Ross,  Okay  that-that’s enough! Y’know  let’s  let’s let someone else play.
Joey, If you didn’t want to play  why did you come to the party?
Rachel, Okay  my turn!!
Phoebe, Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Rachel, It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once  it’ll kick again!
Rachel, All right  well  everybody just remember where they were sitting.
Rachel, Just a bug.
Phoebe, Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder  cold blooded murder.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich! 
Joey, Phoebe  what-what are you doing?!
Phoebe, I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
Joey, All right look  y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them  unless it’s with someone really hot?
Phoebe, Yeah  totally!
Joey, All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong   do it right!
Joey, Feel better now?
Phoebe, Yeah  but at what cost? Six more months  three meals a day  I’m gonna eat like  y’know millions of cows.
Joey, Hey  what if I said  I could even things out for ya  meatwise.
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Well  I eat a lot of meat right?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Joey, Well  suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die  you-you’d just be eating my animals.
Phoebe, Joey  I can’t believe you would do that for me.
Joey, Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There’s no meat in beer  right?
Ross, Okay  we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
Monica, Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Rachel, No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me  but for four years  this baby never missed.
Monica, Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot  I can’t let—  actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Ohh  yeah  well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay!  Ready! Okay! Gimme an ‘E!’
Rachel, Gimme an ‘M!’
Rachel, Gimme an ‘I!’
Rachel, Gimme an ‘L!’
Rachel, Gimme a ‘Y!’
Rachel, What do you get?  Emily!!  Emil—Whoa!!  Okay! So that’s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! 
Rachel, I’m fine! I’m fine! I’m just losing a tooth  it’s no big deal. I have a dentist! Y’know. I’m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.  What do I do now? What do I do now?
Monica, I think you’re done.
Joey, Okay  time to take off the bra. 
Joey,  Take the bra off.
Rachel, All right  come on  let’s go get your coat.
Rachel, Oh  yeah! Real fun.  Y’know  this bra… Really  bothers me.  Y’know  this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here  a lot of memories. If these walls could talk  y’know what they’d say? Wanna hear some memories? 
Rachel, Oh no-no-no! No  I got this all under control.
Rachel, Ughhhh!! Forget it!  This is  this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Rachel, Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here  I could seduce you.
Rachel, Well  I’m sorry  I thought you needed them!
Rachel, Why?!
Rachel, You like me?
Rachel, Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God  I can’t believe this  all this time  I liked you and you liked me!
Rachel, Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no  but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at  you like me and I like you.
Rachel, Oh  now see that’s a fancy but.
Rachel, But….
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Ohh  here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.
Ross, That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh  it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned  so…
Rachel, Oh  Ross  I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Well  if it makes you feel any better  I made a fool out of myself.
Ross, Helps a little.
Rachel, Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Ross, Yeah  have a seat.
Rachel, I’m so sorry.
Ross, That’s okay  I mean it was just two-week thing anyway  I just didn’t want it to end this way  y’know?
Rachel, Well  maybe you didn’t want it to end?
Ross, What do you mean?
Rachel, You seem to really like her.
Ross, Yeah  I really do. Yeah  but what am I gonna do  I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing  y’know no commitment.
Rachel, Ross  that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends  asking to hear stories about you  looking through Monica’s photo albums  I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
Ross, You think?
Rachel, Yeah  you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport  and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross, Hey  you’re right.
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Thanks.  What photo album was it?
Rachel, I don’t know  it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Ross, Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids  that was computer camp! Rach! 
Rachel, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, You’re a pathetic loser  right?
Chandler, Oh-ho  yeah!
Rachel, Sit!
Rachel, Oh my gosh  Joshua!
Rachel, They’re not true?
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, Oh! Oh  I love that but.
Rachel, You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Rachel, Okay.  Every time.
Joey, Oooh  what you got there?
Phoebe, Pastrami.
Joey, Oh-ho-ho  yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?
Phoebe, Hm-mm  corn beef.
Joey, Ooh  I was gonna say bologna  but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
Phoebe, Okay.
Joey,  Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Phoebe, Six months.
Joey, Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes  I can have one of those right?
Phoebe, Not if I get there first.
Joey,  What is that?
Chandler, Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
Joey, Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.
Chandler, Do we pay for this?
Joey, No  we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.
Chandler, Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
Joey, Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill? 
Chandler, Yeah  Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just  came on!
Chandler, Like finding money with naked people on it!
Joey,  Why would he turn off the TV? 
Rachel, All right  y’know what  come on  do we really have to watch this while we eat? 
Chandler, We don’t know what could make this go away.
Joey, Yeah  so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Chandler, And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey, Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will  okay?
Monica, Well at least  I’m going to mute it.
Chandler, We still have porn.
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe,  Hi!
Monica, Hi!
Rachel, Honey  what are you doing? That’s too heavy.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, Give it here.  Oh  God. 
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, Ohh  I’m getting too pregnant for this  lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know  I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. 
Chandler, Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
Phoebe, You mean like a doctor?
Joey, Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!
Phoebe, Ohh!  Oh my. Oh  that reminds me  I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Ross, Hi.
Monica, Hi.
Ross, So uh  Emily just went to the airport.
Monica, Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
Ross, Eh  her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know  we-we said our good-byes this morning  so…
Monica, You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross,  Nah.
Monica, Hey  cheer up! You’re gonna see her again  right?
Ross," Well I  that’s the thing  I don’t know! I mean  whenever I brought it up with her she said   ""This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"""
Monica,  No-no-no  don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.
Ross, And why do you care so much?
Monica, Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross, You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica, No! Y’know  the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land  fall in madly love  and spend the rest of your lives together.
Ross, Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Monica, Yeah that  plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross, Ahh.
Monica, Do you love her?
Ross, We said it was only going to be two weeks  y’know?
Monica, You love her!
Ross, What-what is love really?
Monica," Ohhh  I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say  ""I love you!"" And she’s gonna say  ""I love you  too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss  everyone at the gate will applaud."
Ross, I am a good kisser.
Monica, Then you two can  can sneak into the cockpit  and things will start to heat up  and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.
Rachel, Is that the heartbeat?
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Rachel, Oh wow! This is so cool.
Phoebe, Why don’t take care of this one  and should I get pregnant again  I’ll hold onto your card  okay?
Phoebe, Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!
Phoebe, Well  yeah.
Rachel, Well  so  are-are you sure that there are three?!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Phoebe, What do you know?!
Phoebe, Ooh! Hi!
Phoebe," Oh well  okay  hey  y’know how when you’re umm  you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row  and you say  ""Oh  that’s nice?"""
Phoebe, Okay  yeah well  good news  you’re going to have three babies.
Phoebe, Oh God  I’m so glad you guys are happy  I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Phoebe, No  no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them  and the added expense  and…
Phoebe, No  back to happy. Back to happy!
Phoebe, No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
Phoebe, You can’t give up on your dream.
Ross, Emily! 
Ross, I just  I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Ross, That’s  that’s  that’s a big candy bar.  I had the most amazing time with you.
Ross,  Wait uh  listen. I-I  I have to tell you something. Umm  I’ve been thinking  I’m just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah  I-I think I love you.
Ross, That’s no problem.
Rachel, What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.
Chandler, It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
Rachel, Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
Joey, Yeah right.
Rachel, No  he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Chandler, Oh-oh  yeah  and did he also say that ah  some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Rachel, Yes!
Joey, Yeah  he likes porn.
Monica, Where ya going?
Rachel, I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.  Hey  Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, Hey!
Monica, How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Phoebe, Well  Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast  and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about  ‘cause you work for a big company. Okay  insider trading  what information is there that you can give me.
Chandler, They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
Monica, Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Ross, I did.
Monica, And well  what did she say?
Ross, Thank you.
Monica, Oh  you’re totally welcome! What’d she say?
Ross," She said  ""Thank you."" I said  ""I love you."" And she said  ""Thank you."""
Chandler, Whoa-whoa  wait a minute  did you say  you love her?
Joey, Yeah  what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ross, What do I do now?
Joey, You play hard to get.
Ross, She already lives in London.
Joey, Then you go to Tokyo.
Chandler, All right look  forget it  forget it. You told her you love her  it’s over.
Monica, It is not over! You’re over!
Chandler, What?
Monica, You know!
Chandler, Okay.  Good one.
Monica, It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn’t  is because her feelings were so strong  it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call  she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! 
Ross, Okay! Okay! But if she doesn’t call  it is definitely over! No  wait. Wait. Unless  eventually  I call her  y’know just to she what’s going on  and  and she says she’ll call me back  but then she doesn’t. Then it’s over.
Joey, Way to be strong  man!
Rachel, Hey!
Chandler, Hi! Listen  can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In  Again.
Rachel, Well  so  why don’t you just turn it off?
Chandler, Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Phoebe,  Ooh  good  you’re hear! Okay.
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hi!
Rachel, Well  what-what ‘cha got there?
Phoebe, Oh this  well I’m glad you asked.  Now  don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  Ahh! Now  I know what you’re thinking…
Chandler, Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica, Phoebe  they didn’t make you pay for those knives  did they?
Phoebe, No!
Monica, Are you sure?
Phoebe, No!
Rachel, Honey  you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
Phoebe, No-no  I know that  but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Chandler, What’s the second part of your plan?
Phoebe, My Saturn dealership.
Ross,  Hello?
Ross, Emily  hi! Uh  how-how was you flight?
Ross, No  no  that-that  that’s all right. Umm  I’m just glad you called.
Ross, Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross, She doesn’t know which one of us she wants  me or this Colin guy.
Monica, This isn’t how it’s supposed to go  there can’t be another guy.
Ross, Well…
Monica, Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Ross, I’m not proving anything. Okay  I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place  I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!
Chandler, You put your fist through the wall?
Ross, No  I missed and hit the door. But  it opened really hard!
Monica, You have to go to London!
Ross, What?
Monica, Yeah  you have to go fight for her!
Joey, Oh yeah  sure  that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back  then she called you and told you that there’s another guy  so yeah  go to London that’ll scare her!
Monica, When Rachel was with Paulo  what did you do?
Ross, I made fun of his accent.
Monica, You sat back and let him have her  you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
Ross, No.
Monica, All right then  go fight for her! Go to London! I mean  that could be you and Emily!  That  but-but nicer. Just  go to London!
Ross, Really?
Monica, Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!
Ross, All right. All right  I’m gonna do it!
Monica, All right.
Ross, I’m gonna  I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.
Monica, Okay  good luck!
Joey, Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport  could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? 
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
Monica, That’s sounds great  but how are you going to afford it?
Rachel, Well  we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
Phoebe, I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay. You know how people need transportation  but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two  okay  I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van  bolt the table in the back  and you know what I’ve got?
Chandler, A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe, No! Think about it  it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax  it’s…
Rachel,  Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe, The name was my favourite part!
Rachel, Well  well I can up with it!
Phoebe, YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
Rachel, Well  I…
Monica, Hello.
Ross,  Hey.
Monica, Oh my God! Ross  are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Ross, No  because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy  and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
Monica, All right. When is  when is the next flight out?
Ross, About four hours.
Monica, Okay  just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then  then just come on home.
Phoebe, Hey  tell him about Relaxi-Taxi  and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
Rachel, Okay  it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab  like taxicab.
Phoebe, Oh  that is better.
Chandler, Are we in London?
Monica, What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
Joey,  Nothing. No  nothing.
Monica, Oh  you came to tell him you love him! I knew it!  I was right!  I’m right  right?
Monica, Oh.
Ross,  I love you too! I’m  I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth!  You can’t hear me. 
Ross, Hi.
Ross, Ohh! Thank you.
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, I was just at the bank  and there was this really hot teller  and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Joey, Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over  gives me the pizza  takes the money  and leaves!
Chandler," What  no  ""Nice apartment  I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
Joey, Noo! Nothing!
Chandler, Y’know what  we have to turn off the porn.
Joey, I think you’re right.
Chandler, All right  ready?
Joey, One.
Chandler, Two.
Joey, That’s kinda nice.
Chandler, Yeah  that’s kinda a relief.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, FREE PORN!!!
Joey, Yeah!!
Chandler, We have free porn here!!!
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Wow  it is true what they say  pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Phoebe,  Ha-ha.  No  it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not  I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!
Chandler, All right.
Phoebe, Listen. Listen.  Smelly cat  smelly cat  what are they feeding you?
Joey, Wow  Pheebs! That sounds great!
Phoebe, I know! I know  and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!
Phoebe, Hey! What are you doing here?
Phoebe, Oh  well  don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
Chandler, Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
Phoebe, Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Ross, Hey  if mommy can have a wife  daddy can have a bra.
Ross, Oh  no-no-no  see  that-that clock’s a little fast  uh  we have 17 minutes. Huh  what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Ross, Hey  uh  you can ignore that.
Ross, Uhh  believe me when he’s older  he’ll understand.
Ross, I’ll be right there.   Hello!  Hello!  Hey. Uhh  Emily  this is Carol and Susan.
Ross, Look at you two  bonding  making us late for the airport so…
Ross, Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
Phoebe, Hi!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe, Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like  y’know strong and confident  y’know? Like-like Exxon.
Chandler, Well  it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Joey, Ooh-ooh  Pheebs  you want a strong name? How about  The Hulk?
Phoebe," No  I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk  but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The."""
Joey," Oh  want a good name  go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well  they’re hanging out with Joey."""
Chandler, Hey  y’know what  if you’re gonna do that  if you’re gonna name him Joey  you should name him Chandler.  Oh  come on! Chandler’s funny  sophisticated  and he’s very loveable  once you get to know him.
Joey, Oh well  hey  Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is  if you need him  he’ll be there.
Chandler, Well  Chandler will be there for you too. I mean  well  he might be a little late  but-but  he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda  if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
Joey, What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe, Well  I  I like the idea of naming him after someone I love  and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But  all right  I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.
Joey, I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
Rachel, Hey  Mon  if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight  which one of these would you want to be wearing. 
Monica, Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.
Rachel, Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.
Monica, Um-hmm.
Rachel, What am I making him by the way?
Monica, Well  you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts  wild nuts  wild rice  roast asparagus  and salmon au croup.
Rachel, I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Monica, Yeah  you were  but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you  bitched about it  then you  would stop cooking  and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Rachel, Wow  I really get crabby when I cook.
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, So uh  Emily called last night…
Chandler, And now you’re giving me the message!
Ross, Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah  they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!
Phoebe, God  Susan is so fun!
Ross," Look  this is just a little too familiar  okay? For like  for like six months before Carol and I spilt up  all I heard was: ""My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."""
Chandler, You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Ross, Hey  they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?
Joey, No  but I’m gonna!
Chandler, Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
Ross, How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Phoebe, Yeah  I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
Ross, What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.
Phoebe, No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Ross, Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?
Phoebe, Well  it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk  y’know…
Ross, Actually that-that’s not true  in The Incredible Hulk uh  No. 72  Dr. Bruce Banner found…  Y’know  ugh  nevermind  my girlfriend’s a lesbian. 
Phoebe, So  I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Joey, Oh! Oh-oh  you gotta pick Joey! I mean  name one famous person named Chandler.
Chandler, Raymond Chandler.
Joey, Someone you didn’t make up!
Chandler, Okay  there are no famous Joey’s. Except for  huh  Joey Buttafucco.
Joey, Yeah  that guy really hurt us.
Phoebe, Well  how about a compromise then  okay? What if it’s like y’know  Chanoey?
Chandler, Okay  look  Joey! Come on  think about it  first of all  he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
Joey, All right look man  I didn’t want to bring this up  but Chandler  is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier  but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid  stupid non-name!
Chandler, Wow  you’re  you’re right. I have a horrible  horrible name.
Joey, I’m sorry man  I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, So I guess it’s Joey then!
Rachel, Ohh  please! Cooking soothes me.  Ahh. So  dig in!
Rachel,  Hmmm!
Rachel, Oh I know  my God  this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
Rachel,  Oh  yeah  I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Rachel, Yeah  sure  okay. Okay.
Joey,  Hey  how did you do that?! Come on in. 
Rachel, All gone! So  farm birds  huh?
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, Okay. So  can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? 
Rachel, But  they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away  it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
Rachel, Okay  y’know  would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.
Rachel, Your parents’?
Rachel, Ohh.
Rachel, Yeah that works.
Ross,  Hey!
Ross," Well  I asked him if he wanted to eat  he said  ""No."" I asked him if he wanted to sleep  he said  ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do  he said  ""No."" So  he’s sweeping. "
Ross, So umm  any word from Susan?
Ross, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh  by the by  did it uh  did it ever occur to you that  I don’t know  maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
Ross, Y’know  the kind of fun  you and Susan had when we were married.
Ross, Am I?!
Ross, Am I?!
Ross, Uh-huh  Carol  so were we. All right  just-just imagine for a moment  Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre  and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks  they’re laughing  y’know  someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity  it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?
Ross, OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!
Rachel, Wow! This place is fabulous!
Rachel, Whoa-whoa  there’s two living rooms? God  growing up here  this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
Rachel, Ohh  you should know  this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Rachel, That sounds like a plan. Umm  is there a place I can go freshen up?
Rachel, Ah.
Rachel, Hi you!
Rachel, I know  I can do more than cook.
Rachel, Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you.  Hello.
Rachel, Hello.
Rachel," What? This-this  no  oh no  no-no-no  this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See  see  okay  I work in fashion  see and-and  this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s  they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan  so part of my job is too wear the clothes  and then I see how people respond  and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s  so… And obviously in uh  in-in this case   I am going to report back  ""USA not ready."""
Rachel, Yes!
Rachel, Well  we were going to do that after—I mean umm  next.
Rachel, Oh  yeah  well… Yeah  no use wasting this baby  just lyin’ around the house.
Rachel, Yes.
Joey, Dude  I am sorry about what I said!
Chandler, No  no  you’re right  it is a ridiculous name!
Joey, It’s not that bad.
Chandler, Yes it is! From now on  I have no first name.
Joey, So  you’re just Bing?
Chandler, I have no name.
Phoebe, All right  so  what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler, Okay uh  for now  temporarily  you can call me  Clint.
Joey, No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Chandler, Okay  so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Phoebe, Umm  Gene.
Chandler, It’s Clint. It’s Clint! 
Joey, See you later  Gene.
Phoebe, Bye  Gene.
Chandler, It’s Clint! Clint!
Joey, What’s up with Gene?
Monica, So  you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel, Oh  yeah. And uh  the best part though  when the uh  waiter spilled water down my back  I jumped up  and my boob popped out.
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Monica, Oh  no!
Rachel, No  it’s all right. I got nice boobs. 
Ross,  So  I just picked up a message from Emily  she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Rachel, So?
Ross, So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
Monica, Emily’s straight.
Ross, Oh  wake up!
Phoebe, Wow  Carol really messed you up!
Ross, Excuse me?
Phoebe, Yeah  she turned you into this-this-this untrusting  crazy  jealous  sycophant.  All right  so I don’t know what sycophant means  but the rest is right.
Ross, Look  I don’t know what you’re talking about  I am not a crazy  jealous person.
Rachel, Huh.
Ross, What?
Rachel, She’s totally right! When we were together  you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
Monica, This totally makes sense!
Ross, It does not!
Monica, Oh  sure it does! In high school  you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
Phoebe, All right  all right  so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting  then ’94 hit  Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Rachel, Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica, This is so much fun!
Ross, This is not fun!
Monica, Look  all we’re trying to say is  don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.
Phoebe, Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
Ross, Well  I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Rachel, What—yeah—what  y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Phoebe, Drum roll.
Chandler,  Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark  or a John?
Joey, Nah  you’re not tall enough to be a Mark  but you might make a good Barney.
Chandler, All right look  am I serious  okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Phoebe, You’re actually going through with this?
Chandler, Hey  look  this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay  it’s probably why kids picked on me in school  and why I never do well with women… So  as of 4 o’clock tomorrow  I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Phoebe, You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right  this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes   I’m  I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey  but eh  so  I’m-I’m  I’m gonna  I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.
Chandler,  Really?!
Phoebe, Yeah  but you have to keep the name too!
Chandler, Okay. Thanks.
Phoebe, Okay!
Chandler, You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Phoebe, Yay!
Chandler, Yay!
Phoebe, Yay—oh—yay! Okay  I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!
Chandler, Okay!
Phoebe, Ooh  uh… 
Chandler, Bye  Pheebs!
Phoebe, Okay  bye!
Chandler, Ha! Ha! Ha!
Joey, Ohh! 
Ross, Nice luggage.
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Oh  I missed you too.
Ross,  No tongue. 
Rachel, HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
Rachel, I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Joey, Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning’s here! Morning is here—
Rachel, Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Monica, Hey  I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Rachel, Monica  you don’t even have a bed  you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Monica, Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay  I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Rachel, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Monica, Okay.
Joey, See  this is a great apartment.
Monica, Shut up! This place is a hole!
Ross, Huh? I know  I know. Who am I? David Bowe? 
Ross, Uh  I don’t know  whatever.
Ross, Oh  I know. Y’know what  I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really  when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy  I love that guy! I mean  I love you too  a lot  but that guy! I-I love that guy!
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London  just one more day.
Ross, One more day  seriously/
Ross, So  then you can stay as long as you want.
Ross, Oh no. Don’t  don’t  don’t start packing. Come on! 
Ross, Yeah  I know  I uh  I tried them on.
Ross, No. No  I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
Phoebe,  Hello!
Chandler, Ho! Ho! Ho!
Phoebe, Excuse me.
Chandler, Your pants!
Phoebe, Oh  yeah! You like ‘em? I just  I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
Joey, Uhh  Pheebs  those are uh  those are Santa pants.
Phoebe, What?
Chandler, Santa pants.  Santa Claus’s pants.
Phoebe, Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names.  See  these names are good  and these names are bad.  Ohh.
Rachel,  Hey!
Monica,  Hey!
Rachel, So—Hey  Pheebs! So  how are the elves?
Phoebe, I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the  y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.
Monica, Hey  guys  what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Chandler," Uhh  a T-shirt that says  ""I don’t belong here."""
Joey, You have Knicks tickets?
Rachel, Yeah  my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce  so she just gave them to me.
Monica, Yeah  apparently  they’re pretty good seats.
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey,  Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
Rachel, Do you guys want these?
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Yeah we do!
Rachel, Ohh  well you got ‘em.
Rachel, Just give us our apartment back!
Phoebe, Boy! I didn’t see that coming!
Chandler, Are you serious?
Rachel, Oh  come on! We know what these are worth.
Monica, Yeah  what  do you think we’re stupid?
Joey, You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
Monica, What do you say?
Chandler, Forget it! Okay  I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Rachel, You’re bachelor pad?!
Monica, Have you even had a girl up here?
Chandler, No. But uh  Joey has  and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Joey, Yeah  you do!
Joey, Come on!
Chandler,  Yes  Gunther  can I get two cups of chino  please?
Joey, Come on  season tickets! Season tickets  do you know what that means?
Chandler, Forget it! Okay  I’m not giving up the apartment.
Joey, Oh come—look  when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year  all right? My dad never won! Of course  he wasn’t in the sales division  but still  I never ever  ever forgot that!
Ross,  Hey  guys! 
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Joey, We don’t make enough fun of you already?
Ross, Oh yeah  Emily convinced me to do it.
Chandler, You do know that Wham broke up?
Ross, I like it  and Emily likes it  and that’s what counts. So uh  how are you guys doing?
Joey, Oh-no  don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Chandler, Where is Emily?
Ross, Ugh  she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
Chandler, Man  didn’t she like just get here?
Ross, Yeah!! Yeah!
Chandler, Easy tiger.
Ross," I just  I hate this so much! I mean  every time I go pick her up at the airport  it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking  ""Well  I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days  dropping her off."""
Chandler, So what are you going to do?
Ross, Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean  she lives there  I live here. I mean  she-she’d have to uh  move here. She should move here!
Joey, What?
Ross, I could ask her to live with me!
Chandler, Are you serious?
Ross, I mean  why not! I mean  I mean why not?!
Chandler, Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay  I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
Ross, Look guys  when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her  y’know?
Chandler, And I love the milk! But  I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey  you say things now.
Joey, All right look  Ross  he’s right. Emily’s great  she’s great! But this way too soon  you’re only gonna scare her!
Ross, I don’t want to do that.
Joey, No! You don’t want to wreck it  you don’t want to go to fast!
Ross, Yeah  no  you’re right  I know  you’re right  I’m not  I’m not gonna do it. All right  thanks guys. 
Chandler, Okay  no problem  just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
Phoebe, That’s too hard. Too hard!
Monica,  All right boys  last chance for the tickets!
Rachel, Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend  Joshua.
Chandler, No thank you.
Joey, Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on  let’s trade! The timing’s perfect  I just clogged the toilet!
Chandler, Look  I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay  but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Joey, Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on  we can go to the game tonight!
Chandler, Look  the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
Joey, It’s the Knicks!
Chandler, Screw the Knicks!
Joey, Whoa!
Chandler, I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
Joey, Huh.
Chandler, And the Knicks rule all.
Joey, Yeah  the Knicks rule all!
Phoebe, Hey  so? Are you gonna do it?
Chandler, No. No. We’re not gonna do that  y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
Rachel, All right  okay  look  what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Joey, Done!
Rachel, Let me finish.
Joey, Oh.
Rachel, I’m talking about a bet  winner takes all.
Joey, Ooh  we could end up with nothing.
Phoebe, Or you could end up with everything.
Joey, Ooh  I like that.
Monica, All right  so what do you say?
Chandler, No!
Monica, Oh  just do it!!
Chandler, Op  op  I’m convinced!
Joey, Come on man  you know I’d do it for you! Because  you’re my best friend.
Chandler, All right  but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
Joey, All right!
Phoebe, Ooh  this is so exciting! Ooh  God  what are you going to bet?
Rachel, Oh  okay  well  I think we should let Phoebe decide  because she’s the only who’s impartial  and she’s so pretty.
Phoebe, Okay. Umm  ooh  ooh—oh  I have a game!
Joey, Okay!
Chandler, Okay!
Phoebe, This is great!
Joey, What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
Phoebe, Oh  well  it doesn’t have a name—oh  okay  Phoebeball! No  it doesn’t have a name. Umm  okay  Monica  what is your favourite thing about trees?

Phoebe, Good! Good! Five points!
Phoebe, All right  Joey  same question.

Joey, Seriously  good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
Chandler, No they didn’t!
Ross, Hey!
Ross,  Move in with me.
Ross, Don’t be scared  I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon  but just-just think  think how great it will be.
Ross, I know.
Ross, Well  so  you-you’ll get a job here! I mean  I’m always hearing about uh  them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
Ross, No  I can’t. I would  I really would  but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?
Ross, What?
Ross, No  no  don’t. Why don’t we?
Ross, Get married.
Ross, No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here  ‘cause it’s us together forever  and that’s-that’s what I want.
Ross, Yeah  I know  so what? I mean  who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look  huh  I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean  this  this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean  on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean  last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?
Ross, Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?
Ross, Yes! We’re getting married?!
Ross, Yes!
Ross, Come here  come here. Uh   ow! Emily  will you marry me?
Ross, Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
Chandler, Those were like the best seats ever.
Joey, Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know  kinda like a peace offering.
Chandler, Oh yeah  that’s very nice. Plus  y’know they were free and they’re too small.
Chandler, Oh. Oh  God! 
Joey, Hey  want a beer?   WHOA!!!!
Chandler, I KNOW!!!
Chandler, Open up! Open up! Open up!
Monica, We’ll discuss it  in the morning! 
Chandler, What the hell is going on?!
Rachel, We took our apartment back!! 
Phoebe,  I had nothing to do with it.   Okay  it was my idea  but I don’t feel good about it.
Chandler, We are switching back  right now!
Monica, No  we’re not! We’re not leaving!
Chandler, Well  you’re gonna have to leave sometime  because you both have jobs  and as soon as you do  we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right  Joe?
Joey, I don’t know.
Chandler, What?
Joey, I don’t want to move again!
Chandler, I don’t care  this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment  and we won that apartment fair and square  twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!
Rachel, All right. We figured you might respond this way  so we have a backup offer.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!
Rachel, Let us keep the apartment and…
Monica, As a thank you  Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Chandler, Totally worth it!
Joey, That was one good minute!
Chandler, Good night.
Joey, Good night.
Monica, Men are such idiots.
Rachel, Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Phoebe, That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest  no one would have had to move at all.
Monica, Yeah  let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Okay  scarf’s done. 
Ross, Come on! Come on. Come on.
Chandler, Okay!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, What-what’s going on?
Joey, Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Ross, Uhh  okay  it’s uh  Emily and I  we decided to uh  to get married.
Phoebe, What? Oh  are you pregnant too?!
Monica, When  when did—how  how did you…
Ross, We  we just decided to uh  to go for it.
Ross,  Umm  uh  I was just telling the guys…
Rachel, Yeah  I-I heard.  I think it’s great!  Ohh  I’m so happy for you!
Chandler, Oh  well  that’s great!
Joey, Yeah! Yeah!
Monica,  I can’t believe you’re getting married!
Ross, Yeah. 
Joey, Monica and Rachel made out. 
Joey, Hey!  Get into gear!
Joey,  Okay!
Chandler, Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Joey,  Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Chandler, Oh. Oh  did-did-did I wake you?
Chandler, Gunther  can I get another cup of coffee  please?  So uh  what do you do when you’re not working here?
Chandler, Oh  okay  thanks. 
Monica, Chandler  that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!
Chandler, Well  I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
Monica, He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?
Joey,  Oh  you should here me.
Chandler, It’s not something to be proud of  okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Joey," Look  I told ya  I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem  you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a ""Quit being a baby and leave me alone"" clinic!"
Chandler, They don’t have those.
Joey, Yeah  they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There  you’ve just had your first class!
Monica, Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper  and whenever I started to snore  he would just roll me over…
Joey, Ohhh  yeah!
Monica, He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Chandler, Next time you snore  I’m rolling ya over!
Joey, I gotta do what I gotta do  you gotta do what you gotta do  you just do it.
Ross,  Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey  all right!
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh  the Olympics.
Monica, Have you guys picked a date yet?
Ross, Oh no  not yet.
Phoebe, I still cannot believe you’re engaged!  Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.
Ross, Oh. Thanks. Uh  has anyone seen Rach?
Monica, Ugh  she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!
Ross, Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm  Emily found this wedding dress in London…
Phoebe, Already?!
Ross, Yeah  but it didn’t fit. Well  luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size  but I’m the groom  I’m not supposed to see the dress…
Monica, I’ll pick it up for you!
Ross, Thank you.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Oh  she’s got you running errands  y’know  picking up wedding dresses…  Wah-pah!
Ross, What’s wah-pah?
Chandler, Y’know  whipped! Wah-pah!
Joey, That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
Chandler, That’s what I did. Wah-pah!
Joey, You can’t do anything!
Rachel, Hey  Mon  I was just doing the dishes!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Oh! It’s you.  Hi.
Ross, Hey  do uh  do you have a minute?
Rachel, Yeah  yeah  I was just about to take a break anyways  so…
Ross, So listen uh  I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh  Emily and I decided to get married  and uh  I was just wondering how you were.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, I know if you were getting married I’d feel  kinda….. y’know.
Rachel, Yeah. Yeah. Definitely  well it definitely took me by surprise  but I’m okay.
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, All right  I just wanted to check.
Rachel, Oh  that’s sweet.
Ross, You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Rachel,  Uhh  hang in there?
Ross, Oh  no  I didn’t mean  uh…
Rachel, I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?
Ross, Oh  I thought you guys had just been on like four dates  I didn’t realise that had become anything  yet.
Rachel, Oh  no-no-no  no-no-no  it has become  it has—yeah. Oh no  those were four great dates.
Ross, Oh. Yeah?
Rachel, Yeah. Oh  yeah. And I mean  the connection  I mean y’know  emotionally  mentally  physically…
Ross, Wow  that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.
Rachel, I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.
Ross, Uh-huh.
Rachel, You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know  it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well  I gotta get  I gotta get back to the dishes.
Ross, I gotta get to work.
Rachel, Oh yeah? Fine.
Ross, Hey  y’know  y’know what would make me really happy?
Rachel, Oh yeah  no  what’s that?
Ross, If like the four of us could all y’know  hang out together. Uh  in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend  why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say  Sunday night?
Rachel, That would be great!
Ross, Yeah  all right  it’s a date. 
Rachel,  Hang in there. You hang in there. 
Ross,  Did you say something?
Rachel, No  just singing. 
Monica, Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!
Phoebe, Yeah  but y’know  about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Monica, Oh  yes  umm  I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.
Monica, Emily Waltham.
Monica,  Okay.
Phoebe, You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.
Monica, I am  aren’t I?
Monica, Yes?
Monica, All right. 
Chandler, All right buddy  time to roll over.   No-no!  No  no-n-n-n-no!! You are going to a clinic! You’re going to a clinic  and a pyjama store!
Monica, Does she use the cups? Yes! I believe she does. Does she use the plates? Yes! I believe she does. 
Monica, Oh. Thank you. Ohhh  thank you very much. Oh  thank you for coming.  Uh  just a second!
Phoebe, No-no  let me in!
Monica, Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Monica, Can you just hold on for one minute?
Phoebe, No  you have to let me in right now!!
Monica, Are you alone?
Phoebe, Yes!
Monica, All right.
Joey, This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!
Chandler, It’s 6:00.
Joey, Yeah  well…
Rachel,  Hi!
Chandler, Hey  I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily  and I think that’s  I think that’s really cool.
Joey, Yeah  Rach  I think you’re handling that really well.
Rachel, Handling it? What do you mean  handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now  maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know  they’re not gonna get married anyway!
Chandler, What?
Rachel, Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean  they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way  one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya  you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
Chandler, Yeah  well  I don’t dance at weddings.
Rachel, Why not?
Chandler, Because weddings are a great place to meet women  and when I dance  I look like this… 
Ross, Hey man.
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, So  what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Chandler, Nothing.
Rachel, Nothing.
Joey, I am…  free!
Ross, Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Ross, Yep!
Rachel, In a month?
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, You mean  you mean 30 days?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, From now?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Well  that’s great.
Ross, Yeah! Yeah  Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married  but it’s going to be torn down  so… I mean  I-I know it’s crazy  but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy  and I don’t know  this just feels right. Y’know?
Joey,  Hey! That’s the day after I stop menstruating!  This isn’t mine.
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Ohh  nothing  I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you.  See you.
Rachel, Yeah!  Sit!
Rachel, I’m more than okay  I am really  really happy! Wanna know why?
Rachel, ‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are  I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean  I think we are working  I think we are clicking. Y’know?
Rachel, Yeah-yeah  y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
Rachel, Well  yeah  right  y’know what? Yeah  you’re right  I mean  we no  we have our fun. Yeah! But if ……I mean  I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay  all right. This is gonna  this is gonna sound y’know  a little umm  hasty  but uh  just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
Rachel," Oh  I know  I know  it’s-it’s so  it’s so totally like  ""Whoa! Can we do this?"" Y’know  I mean  but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean  it just feels right  don’t you think?"
Joey, Joey Tribbiani.
Chandler,  Yes he did.
Chandler,  Hey  check out that girl! She is really hot!
Joey,  Yeah  she is. Wow!  How you doin’?
Joey, What?!
Chandler, You’re coming on to the entire room!  I’m Chandler.
Chandler, Hi.
Chandler, You mind if I…
Chandler, So uh  what are you in for?
Chandler, What a coincidence  I listen in my sleep.
Joey,  So why don’t you give me your number?
Monica, Okay  ready?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe,  I got it! Mine! 
Monica, Congratulations!
Phoebe, Thank you!
Monica, Okay! My turn! My turn!
Phoebe, Okay!  Okay  ready?
Monica,  Yeah.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica,  That was a terrible throw!!
Phoebe, I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
Monica, Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?!  Oh my God. We’re really sad  aren’t we?
Phoebe, Yeah  I think we are.
Monica, This isn’t even my dress.
Phoebe," Well  at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called  ""It’s Not Too Late."""
Monica, I’m changing out of this.
Phoebe, Me too.
Monica, In like a half-hour?
Phoebe, Me too.
Monica, Okay  throw it straight this time.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, I’m getting married next!!
Phoebe, Yay!
Phoebe, I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.
Monica, Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while  but didn’t you start feeling silly?
Phoebe, I guess.
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Monica, Oh God.
Phoebe, Oh  you’re such a cheater!
Chandler,  Hello! Little ones.
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, So  is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Chandler, Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.  Joey wanted to ask her out  but uh  she picked me.
Phoebe, Oh  how’d that happen?
Chandler, Because I’m cooler.
Monica, No  seriously.
Chandler, Well she’s  she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.
Joey,  Hey you guys! What’s happening?
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, What is that?
Joey,  Oh  they gave it to me at the sleep clinic  and it’s gonna help me not to snore.
Monica, Well  are you asleep right now  Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!
Joey,  I know I don’t have too! It tastes good. 
Chandler, Plus  you look cool.
Rachel,  Well  I just called Joshua…
Phoebe, Oh  how did it go?
Rachel, Well  I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.
Phoebe, What did he say?
Rachel, Well uh  his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
Monica, Ohh  sweetie!  Hey  I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.
Rachel, Yeah  maybe  but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know  I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married  but as it turns out  I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.
Phoebe, Yeah  maybe.
Rachel, And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
Phoebe, Any luck?
Rachel, Well  yeah  y’know how Ross and I were on again  off again  on again  off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road  we would be on again.
Monica, Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
Ross,  Hey!
Monica, Hey! 
Ross, So  I got us some reservations for Sunday night  okay? How about  Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?
Rachel, Yeah  well  you uh  better make it for three.
Ross, Oh  see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
Rachel, Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.
Ross, What happened?
Rachel, Uh  well  I think  I think he broke up with me.
Ross, Noo. Why?
Rachel, Well  apparently he scares easy.
Ross, Oh  Rachel  I’m-I’m sorry.
Rachel, It’s okay. Sometimes  things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.
Ross, Come here.
Rachel,  Oh  hey  don’t you have to go pick up Emily?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, You okay?
Rachel, Yeah! I got my girls.
Rachel, Ugh. 
Phoebe,  Hey  y’know what might cheer you up?
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Y’know  I gotta tell ya  this really does put in a better mood.
Monica, Oh  I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.  Maybe someday  there will be.
Monica, Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Rachel, Oh  okay! 
Monica, No-no  Rachel  don’t get it! He can’t see us!
Phoebe, No  yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
Rachel, I’m not gonna marry Chandler!
Phoebe, Not after this!
Rachel, Okay  you guys  just relax.  I doooo. 
Rachel, Oh  wait  Joshua! Joshua!   Yeah  well  that oughta do it.
Joey,  Dude! I am trying to sleep! 
Chandler, Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
Joey, I know. Ross is getting married.
Chandler, Phoebe is  making people.
Joey, Everybody’s doing stuff!
Chandler, And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here  would be by the ass print on this chair! Look  we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
Joey,  We could climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler, No-no  not something stupid  something huge.
Joey, No-no-no-no-no  I saw an ad for this video  people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Chandler, Why not?! I mean it’s just  it’s just climbing! It’s just  it’s just steep!
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, We’re going to Everest! Okay  it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, What-what’s up?
Joey, We’re gonna climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler, Yeah baby!
Phoebe, Really?! I looked into that. Yeah  but  I mean it costs like $60 000 and y’know you can die. And  you would die!
Chandler,  Yeah  well…
Joey, We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler, Yeah  we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!
Joey, And while we’re down at the video store  you know what else we could rent? Die Hard!  Oh  y’know what? I just remembered  that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Chandler,  Oh  well…
Phoebe, So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
Chandler, Yeeeeahhhh.
Joey, Yeah. Yeah.
Chandler, But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
Joey, Yeah we are!
Ross, Ohh  God  nobody likes him  and he’s so cheap  he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah  invite him? Hey  did I do these neat enough? 
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Sure. Why not?
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Wait-wait-wait  do you  do you think  maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
Ross, Yeah sure.
Ross, Huh? Yeah  fine  invite whoever you want.
Ross, I don't want to be single  okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
Chandler, And I just want a million dollars! 
Monica, Rachel?!
Rachel, Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are  you are!
Monica, Okay  everybody  this is Rachel  another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody  this is Chandler  and Phoebe  and Joey  and- you remember my brother Ross?
Rachel, Hi  sure!
Ross, Hi.
Ross, You know you probably didn't know this  but back in high school  I had a  um  major crush on you.
Rachel, I knew.
Ross, You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Rachel, I did.
Ross, Oh. Listen  do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Rachel, Yeah  maybe...
Ross, Okay... okay  maybe I will...
Ross,  See  I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel, Really?
Ross, I do.
Rachel, Oh Ross  you're so great. 
Joey, It's never gonna happen.
Ross, Hey  I have a question. Well  actually  it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Okay. Umm  for a while now  I've been wanting to  um....
Rachel, Ohhh!!!! 
Ross, Yes  yes  that's right...
Rachel, Oh  look at the little cat!  Look at it!
Ross, What?  Ow!
Rachel, All right  listen  missy. If you want this cart  you're gonna have to take me with it!
Rachel,  Yes! Did you see that?
Ross, You were incredible! Brand new woman  ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel, I could not have done this without you.
Ross, Ok  um  uh  more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine  I'm fine.
Ross, You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel,  What?
Ross, I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel, Hey  I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Ross, The point is I... I don't need this right now  OK. It  it's too late  I'm with somebody else  I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Rachel, Alright  fine  you go ahead and you do that  alright Ross.
Ross, Fine.
Rachel, 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross, Good.
Rachel, Good. 
Rachel, Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
Ross, No  hey  I get that  okay  I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya  but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay  I don’t know what to do anymore.
Rachel, Well neither do I!
Ross, Is this about Mark?
Rachel,  Oh my God.
Ross, Okay  it’s not  it’s not.
Rachel, Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again  Ross  no  you’re  you’re  you’re making this too hard.
Ross, Oh I’m  I’m making this too hard. Okay  what do you want me to do.
Rachel, I don’t know  I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look  maybe we should take a break.
Ross, Okay  okay  fine  you’re right. Let’s ah  let’s take a break   let’s cool off  okay  let’s get some frozen yogart  or something.. 
Rachel, No.  A break from us.
Ross, Yeah  y'know the ah  the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah  she wants to get back together with me. Oh  I found it!!
Ross, Yeah!
Ross, Oh  thank you.  Hey  hey.  Rachel!!!!

Ross,  Ahhhh!! 
Rachel,  Y'know what  I want you to leave! Get outta here!
Ross, No!!
Rachel, Just get out! Now!!
Ross, No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel, Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler, Uh-oh.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Was she good?
Joey, Don’t answer that.
Rachel, Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it  let’s talk about it!! How was she?
Ross, She was...
Joey, Awful! Horrible!
Chandler, She was not good. Not good.
Joey, She was nothing compared to you.
Ross, She  she was different.
Joey, Ewwwww!
Chandler, Uh-oh.
Rachel, Good different?
Ross, Nobody likes change.
Ross, What? Okay  okay  okay  okay.
Rachel,  ...the way you owned up to everything  it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all  “Once a cheater  always a cheater.”  Ooh  I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months  but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
Ross, WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Rachel, You seem to really like her.
Ross, Yeah  I really do. Yeah  but what am I gonna do  I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing  y’know no commitment.
Rachel, Ross  that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends  asking to hear stories about you  looking through Monica’s photo albums  I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.
Ross, You think?
Rachel, Yeah  you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport  and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Ross, Hey  you’re right.
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Ohh  this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!
Joey,"  Hey  pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding  you have to cry  ""Handkerchief?"" ""No-no  I got my invitation."""
Phoebe, Oooh look! Isn’t this adorable  Ross let Ben address mine!
Chandler,  Hello!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! Hey  did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?
Chandler,  Noo.
Joey, Don’t worry man  I get to bring a guest. We’ll show him.
Phoebe, I’m so jealous you’re all going! I can’t believe I never knew that you can’t fly in your third trimester!
Chandler, I didn’t know that.
Monica, I never knew that either.
Joey, I knew that!  I sooo didn’t know that  but you should see your faces.
Rachel,  Hey guys! What’s up?
Joey, Heyyy. 
Monica, We’re hanging out.
Rachel, What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
Chandler, See  maybe that’s the one we should’ve actually hidden.
Rachel, Oh  no! No you guys! Come on  you don’t have to do that! I’m happy for him! I am! I really—I’m-I’m happ—I’ll work on it.
Monica, I’m sorry honey.
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Rach  you’re gonna come though aren’t you?
Rachel, Oh  honey  I don’t know. I…
Chandler," This isn’t one of those uh  y’know ""If she doesn’t come  we-we don’t  we don’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket…"
Monica, You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it  okay?
Rachel, No  I’ll think about it. Yeah.
Rachel, Who's this from?
Chandler, Oh  that's Ross's.
Rachel, Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe, Remembered what?
Rachel, It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store  and I saw this pin in the window  and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Phoebe, Oh  it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica, I can't believe he did this.
Chandler, Come on  Ross? Remember back in college  when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel, What did you just say?
Chandler,  F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel, Oh.... my God.
Rachel,   Oh my God.
Ross, But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China  guess who's in charge of the dig.
Rachel, Julie! Julie  isn't that great? I mean  isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch  spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Ross, Oh  that is so sweet. No  no  ok  you hang up. Ok  ok  one  two  three. Well you didn't hang up either.
Rachel,  She didn't hang up either...
Ross,  Ok  no  no  you hang up. You  you  y—

Ross, What. Oh no  you just rolled over the juice box.
Ross, Gunther! Gunther. Gunther  please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Ross, Y'know  hey! You’re the one who ended it  remember?
Rachel, Yeah  because I was mad at you  not because I stopped loving you!
Ross, You still love me?
Rachel, Noo.
Ross, What does this mean? What do you  I mean do you wanna  get back together?
Rachel, Noo! Maybe! I  I don’t know.
Ross, What?!
Rachel, I just  I feel  I-I just...
Rachel, Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross,  FINE BY ME!! 
Rachel, And hey! Just so you know  it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler, I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel, Oh my God.
Monica, You know what this is  this is us getting ready for the prom.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, You know what  you guys  we don't have to watch this.
Monica, Shut up  the camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler, Ahh  so how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica, Oh  dad  turn it off.
Joey, Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Rachel, I can't go to my own prom without a date  I can't  it's too late.
Monica, If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Ross, Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough  let's turn it off.
Ross, OK  fine  well I'm not gonna watch  alright.
Ross,  Okay dad.
Monica,  I can't believe you did that.
Ross, Yeah  well.
Phoebe, See  he's her lobster.
Monica,  Nooooo. You’re really not going?
Rachel, Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean  it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just  it’s for the best  y’know it is  it’s… Y’know  plus  somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then  and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
Monica, You don’t have a car. And your license expired.
Rachel, I know.  Yeah  see  there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
Chandler," All right  check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  ""It’s almost as good as being there."""
Joey, It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
Chandler, Well  You could  but... probably just the one time.
Joey, I bet we could get videos of all the sites  get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Chandler, If we do that  we gotta get Die Hard.
Joey, Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Phoebe,  That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!
Monica, That’s also like the tenth time you told us.
Phoebe, Yeah  oh I’m sorry  it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya  it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise  Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee  which of course is decaf  ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!
Ross, Pheebs  did…you want a cookie?
Phoebe,  Thank you so much.
Rachel, So uh  Pheebs  honey  how are those mood swings coming?
Phoebe, I haven’t really had any yet.
Ross, Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Hey!
Ross, All right  here’s the ring. 
Chandler,  Yes! Yes! A thousand times  yes!
Ross, So uh  any ideas for the bachelor party yet?
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties  don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
Chandler, Oh  it’s awkward. It’s awkward. It’s awkward.
Ross, I sort’ve already asked Chandler.
Joey, What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Ross, Joey  I figured you’d understand. I mean  I-I’ve known him a lot longer.
Joey, Come on Ross! Look  I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!
Chandler, You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey,  I’ll never get to be a best man!
Ross,  Wait-wait  so  you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  you—yeah  of course you get to be my best man.
Joey,  What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Chandler, I’m not even getting married! Okay  this is a question for science fiction writers!
Joey, I can’t believe you’re not picking me.
Ross, Hey  how can it not be me?!HeyHey!
Chandler, I’m not even… I’m not even…
Ross, Fine  y’know what  that’s it. From now on  Joey  I want you to be my best man.
Joey, Yes!  Shame about you man.
Phoebe,  Stop it!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, One of the babies is kicking.
Monica, I thought that was a good thing.
Phoebe, It’s not kicking me  it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don’t make me come in there!
Joey,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Joey, Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
Monica, Yeah  there’s one right under the cabinet.

Joey, Oh-whoa  what party?
Rachel, Well umm…

Phoebe, I can’t believe I’m gonna have a party! This is so great!  A party!  Yay!!  I don’t know why.
Joey, This is what I’ve got going for the party so far  liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Ross, Great. Great.

Ross, Yeah. Tell ya what  let’s not invite any of the anthropologists  only the dinosaur dudes!
Joey, Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.
Chandler,  Hey guys  what are you doing?

Chandler, Oh  I’m Ross. I’m Ross. I’m too good for the Hut; I’m too good for the Hut.
Ross, Look  I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey  just remember to keep it on the mellow side  okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker  no-no strippers or anything okay?

Joey, Oh  I chose not to hear that.
Monica, Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?
Rachel, Little village people.
Monica, Okay  look at this one. This is my favourite. 
Rachel, Oh  that is so sweet!
Monica, I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Rachel, Huh. Except  Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Monica, Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.
Rachel, Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Monica, Wait a minute! Unless  we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm  regular coffee  Tequila.
Rachel, Oh  and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!
Monica, Oh  she’s gonna love that!
Phoebe, What the hell is this?! What  did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right  what’s my next present?!

Joey, Dude  this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night  everything’s cool! I wake up this morning  the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!
Chandler, You slept with the stripper?
Joey, Of course!! 
Phoebe, Hi  guys.
Rachel, Hi! Phoebe. 
Monica, Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe, I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones  y’know.
Rachel, No we…
Monica, Hormones.
Rachel, …hormones  yeah.
Phoebe, Anyway  I just wanted to say thank you  it was just  it was so sweet. 
Monica, Wow  you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?
Phoebe, Good. Y’know—no-no  okay  it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately  so what’s happening with you?
Rachel, Oh  well  actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
Phoebe, Oh!
Rachel, It just might be too hard  given the history and all that…
Phoebe, Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm  living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Rachel, Well  h-how is this like that?
Phoebe, Well  let’s see  it’s not. Really  like that. Because  you see that was an actual problem  and uh  yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
Rachel,  I’m-I’m sorry  I just thought that…
Phoebe, Alrighty  here come the water works. 
Joey, Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me  if this isn’t an emergency  then what is?
Ross,  Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey…
Ross, I just wanted to thank you again for last night  what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know  one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before  so…
Joey, So uh  hey  that uh  that wedding ring  huh? Man  that’s nice!
Ross, Yeah  right!
Joey, I was uh  I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself  I might want to get one of those…
Ross, That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country  that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Chandler, So you might say  the ring is irreplaceable? 
Ross, Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations  and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Chandler, So you might say  it’s a magic ring.
Joey,  Yeah  the stripper stole it.
Ross, My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Chandler," Well  I think it all started when you said  ""Hey Joey  why don’t you be my best man."""
Ross,  All right-all right  fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
Joey, Dude  I screwed up  you don’t have to turn me in!
Ross, Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey, Oh  yeah  well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.
Ross, Okay  well  we’ll call the company that sent her!
Joey," I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said  ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police."" I said  ""If you talk to the police  you tell them I’m missing a ring!"""
Ross, So what  Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well  how could this happen?!
Joey, Look Ross  I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…
Chandler, Well  what if we just ah  called her  used a fake name  and had her come to my office?
Joey, Oh  that sounds like fun  but we’ve got a ring to find!!
Monica, Here’s your tea Phoebe. 
Phoebe,  It’s so good.  Oh  thanks.
Rachel, Good.
Monica, I’m so glad you liked it.
Phoebe,  Oh! 
Monica, What?!
Rachel, What?! She made the tea! 
Phoebe, Oh! No  I-I think I just had a contraction.
Rachel, You what?
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Yeah  I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago  and now I know that was definitely one.
Monica, Wait  you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!
Rachel, Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna  I’m gonna  I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Phoebe, No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that  that can happen near the end  just somebody get the book.
Monica, Rachel  get the book! The book!
Rachel, Okay!  Okay! Here!
Monica, The Bible?!
Rachel, I don’t know!
Joey, All right  okay  this is great  uh  Chandler  you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully  she won’t recognise you because  well  why would she? Uh  okay  and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez  and I’ll be uh  Mr. Wong.
Ross, Diverse.
Chandler,  You be cool. 
Ross, Where’s my ring? My dead grandmother’s wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Chandler, Way to be cool  man.
Joey, There was a ring  in a box  on my nightstand  after you left  it was gone!
Ross, We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Chandler, Marry me. 
Joey, I don’t get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn’t take it  and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it  then who did?  Shh! We’re trying to think! 
Rachel, I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.
Phoebe, Well  do you see any babies?
Monica, How do you feel?
Phoebe, Okay  I guess. I mean… I don’t know  it’s just  I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.
Rachel, Well  isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.
Phoebe, I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re  when you’re done with the pregnant thing  y’know  then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know  sitting around in my leather pants  drinking Tequila.
Monica, Some moms do that.
Phoebe, Okay that’s even sadder. Look  I know  I know what I got myself into  it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like  it’s like I know them y’know  I mean-I mean  it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Monica, Aww  sweetie  but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews  and some ways that’s even better.
Phoebe, Yeah  okay.
Rachel, No  really. Really  Pheebs  you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college  or yelling at them when they’re bad  y’know  or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?
Monica, I mean  you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home  and the one they talk to about sex.
Rachel, And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Phoebe, Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, And y’know what else  oh my God  are they gonna love you.
Phoebe, They are gonna love me.
Rachel, Oh!
Phoebe, Thanks you guys! Again.
Monica, Oh  sweetie! 
Phoebe, You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!
Phoebe, Just kidding. Ahh!
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Got cha again  you guys are so easy.
Joey, If anything should happen to him…
Ross, Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
Joey, So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!
Chandler, He will  Joe.
Joey, Yeah  but what if he doesn’t? He’s such a good duck.
Joey, I’m so worried about him  y’know?
Ross, Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! 
Joey, H-h-h-how’s the duck?
Joey, Ohh  great! Oh hey  listen Ross  thanks for being so cool about this.
Ross, No  that’s all right.
Joey, No  it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!
Chandler, Hey  come on  it’s not your fault.
Joey, Yeah  it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring  right? Y’know what  Ross you were right from the start  he  should be your best man.
Chandler, No  you should.
Joey, Now  don’t argue with me…
Ross, Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man  and I want both you guys.
Chandler, Really?
Joey, Really?
Ross, Hey  both you guys should be up there with me. I mean  you two are-are my… I mean  I’m lucky to have just one good… 
Chandler, Thanks man.
Joey,  I gotta go check something over here. 
Chandler, What a baby.
Ross, Total wuss!
Monica, Guys  hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London  there could be a line at customs! Come on!! 
Chandler, Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
Monica, Passport  check!  Camera  check! Traveller’s cheques  check!
Rachel," Who are you saying ""check"" too?"
Monica, Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah  you do a good thing  you get a check!  My mom does it  I never realized it was weird.
Phoebe, Yeah  my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well  actually  she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ross,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey! Are you ready yet?
Monica, Yep! You got the tickets?
Ross, Oh! Got ‘em right here   check!
Joey, It’s all London  baby! Here we go. 
Chandler, You got your passport?
Joey, Yeah  in my third drawer on my dresser. You don’t want to lose that.
Joey, Ohh!! 
Chandler, There it is.
Monica, Okay  if you need the vacuum  it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah  the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…
Phoebe, Okay  okay  but Rachel’s gonna be here too  can’t I just ask her this stuff?
Monica, Yeah  okay  give that a try!
Chandler,  All right! Let’s do it!
Joey, Woo-hoo!!
Ross, Yeah  cheerie-o!
Joey, London baby!
Chandler, Okay  ‘cause that’s not gonna get annoying.
Joey,  London baby!!
Chandler, Hey  y’know what? I was wrong.
Ross, Well  we’re all here! I guess we should get going!
Phoebe, Ohhh  I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding  but I don’t—can’t get up.
Ross, Oh  I’ll-I’ll come hug you.
Phoebe, Great! Yeah  could you bring me the newspaper?
Ross, Yeah. 
Phoebe, Oh  have a great wedding!
Ross, Thanks.
Phoebe, Oh  hey  Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Chandler, Hey! 
Phoebe, Oh  and great! You might as well bring me my book  it’s on the counter in your apartment.
Chandler, Oh. 
Ross,  So  we’re off.
Rachel, Have fun!
Ross, Thanks!  Ugh  I can’t believe you’re not gonna be there!
Rachel, Oh  I know.
Ross, So-so come! Why don’t you come?
Rachel, What?!
Ross, To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.
Rachel, Yeah  well  I gotta work  I’m sorry.
Ross, Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
Rachel, Because  I can’t! Ross  I told you  no. I can’t.
Ross, This is my wedding.
Monica, All right  y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!
Ross, Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
Chandler,  Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
Phoebe,  Thank you.
Phoebe, Thank you. 
Ross, All right  let’s go! Bye  Pheebs!
Joey, Bye  Pheebs!
Joey, London baby!! 
Phoebe, Oh  do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!
Joey, Come on! Do something!
Chandler, I am  I’m ignoring you.
Joey, Okay  here!  I wanna be the on camera guy. All right  first stop  Westminster Abbey. 
Chandler, Oh  what the hell is that?
Joey, It’s London  baby! All right  the hotel’s here.  Wait. No  we wanna go… No. I know.  I’m gonna have to go into the map. 
Chandler, Okay  if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Joey, I got it!  Here we go.
Chandler, Okay. Listen-listen  we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
Joey, Shhh!  Man  you made me lose it! 
Ross, Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily   honey  okay?
Ross, What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
Ross, Sweetie  you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great  okay? Come on. Come on.
Monica, Chicken Kiev?
Ross, Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
Monica, Yeah  y’know  but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And  you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella.  So  I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!
Ross, Yeah. Yeah. Yes  this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.
Monica, It’s nice.
Ross, It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
Ross, Uh-huh  I see that.
Monica,  Okay  I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
Ross, What? What?
Monica, They torn it down a few days early.
Joey, All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down  best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey  Chandler?
Chandler, I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know  they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.
Joey, Really? To what?
Chandler, To Put the Camera Away!!!
Joey, Man  you are Westminster Crabby. 
Phoebe, Oh. Oh.
Rachel, Oh  honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?
Phoebe, Oh  no. Oh  nothing.
Rachel, Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Phoebe, Okay  I have a wedgie.
Rachel, Okay  that is all you.
Phoebe, So-so  what do you want for lunch?
Rachel, Oh  I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.
Phoebe, Yeah  I do. What’s the matter?
Rachel, I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Phoebe, Eh  don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…
Rachel,  Still in love with?!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, I’m not in love with Ross!
Phoebe, Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah  me neither.
Rachel, Phoebe  I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because  I’m still in love with him! I mean  hey  y’know  I like Ross as much as the next guy  y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him  but feelings don’t mean love! I mean  I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But  I have  I have continuing feelings of love  but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him  but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!
Phoebe, We thought you knew!
Rachel, We?!
Phoebe, Yeah  we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel, You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe, Oh no  Ross doesn’t know anything.
Rachel, Oh  I can not believe you didn’t tell me!
Phoebe," Well  because we thought you knew!! It’s so obvious! God  that would be like telling Monica  ""Hey  you like things clean."""
Joey, Hey!
Joey, Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?
Chandler," Well  I don’t have to buy that  ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
Joey, Well  I like it. Here you go. 
Chandler, All right  look  you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Joey, Oh  I embarrass you?
Chandler, How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
Chandler, Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Chandler, All right  look  if you insist on wearing that  in public  y’know  you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Joey, Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
Joey, Thanks.
Chandler, Okay  wait. All right  that’s it  okay  I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! 
Ross, Hey! I just spoke to your dad  and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
Ross, Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Ross, She said what?
Ross, Postpone it? Emily  do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here  huh?  This isn’t right.
Ross, I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? 
Ross, The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
Ross, No. I’m saying it’s now. 
Ross, There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Ross,  No  wait! Emily! No  wait  stop! Emily  please—
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel,  Hi.
Phoebe, So  did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Rachel, Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Phoebe, Well  I think I can help you get over him.
Rachel, You can?
Phoebe, Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Rachel, Um-hmm.
Phoebe, And a small piece of chocolate.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, And a glass of tepid water. 
Rachel, Ooh  is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Phoebe, Uh  only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah  the pictures are for you  the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay  I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
Rachel, I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Phoebe, Okay. Umm  before we get started  I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross  I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay  now  close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair  but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease  it’s—uck! Hah?
Rachel, I don’t know  his uh  his hair never really bothered me that much  and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Phoebe, Okay  this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm  let’s try some uh  aversion therapy.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay?
Rachel, All right.
Phoebe, So uh  now look at the picture…
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, All right  and umm… 
Rachel, Ow!
Phoebe, Okay  how do you feel now?
Rachel, Well  I like you less!
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Hey. 
Joey, Oh.  Sorry!
Chandler, No-no-no  y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me  I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better  I’ve had a really lousy day.
Joey, Me too.
Chandler, Yeah?
Joey, Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude  check this out!
Monica,  Hey!
Joey, Sh-shh-shh! 
Joey,  Okay  so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
Joey,  Oh  Chandler.
Chandler, That’s… That’s was…
Monica, Oh my God!
Joey, That’s Fergie baby!!
Chandler, How did you? How? How?
Joey, Well  I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace  right? So  I’m in my map and-and… Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Monica,  Yes  I did! And you are welcome!
Ross, Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Monica, Umm…
Chandler, I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
Joey, Wait up! 
Ross, Hey-hey  since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady  here’s a pickle  what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
Monica, She said that?!
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, Why?!
Ross, I don’t know  I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Monica, Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!
Ross, Excuse me?
Monica, Ross  how long have you been planning this wedding?
Ross, I don’t know. A month?
Monica, Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding  and the perfect place  with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake   with the little people on top.  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Ross, I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing  I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Monica, Sometimes we were.
Ross, Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Monica, Okay.
Ross, Come on. 
Chandler, That was pretty intense huh?
Joey, Yeah.  Hey  I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
Chandler,  I hope he did!
Phoebe, Hello.
Joey,  Hey  Pheebs! It’s Joey!
Phoebe, Hey  Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured  he doesn’t care if he looks like you.
Joey, That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen  I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Phoebe, Ohh  they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So  do you miss me?
Joey, Kinda  but I’ve just been having way too much fun.
Phoebe, So you’re not homesick yet?
Joey, No  I don’t think so.
Phoebe, All right  the seven of us miss you.
Joey, Who’s seven?
Phoebe, Y’know  me  Rachel  the birds  the babies…
Joey, Ahh  the babies miss me?
Phoebe, Ooh  the pizza guy’s here!
Joey, What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Phoebe, Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you  y’know we ordered the Joey Special.
Joey, Two pizzas?!
Phoebe, Yep! Okay  gotta go  talk to you later.
Joey, Wait  well  where did you get it from?!
Monica, You’ll see.
Ross, Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights  okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks  and-and-and flowers  and candles…
Monica, And the musicians  look  they can go over here   okay? And the chairs can face this way   and…  You go.
Ross, But-but  if you don’t love this  we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really  it’s fine  whatever you want.
Ross, And  I don’t know  if it starts to rain…
Monica, Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
Rachel, Pheebs?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, Do you remember where the duck food is?
Phoebe, Yeah  it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?
Rachel,  Because I’m going to London.
Phoebe, What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
Rachel, Yeah  I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey  you take care  you don’t have those babies until I get back. 
Phoebe, I—Rachel  you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!
Rachel, Yeah  I know  I know  I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Phoebe," That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say  ""Yeah  I love you too  Rach. Forget that British chippy."""
Rachel, Ohh—Do you think he will?!
Phoebe, No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look  Rachel  if you go  you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know  it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry  I know this must be really hard  it’s over.
Rachel," Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says  ""I do."" "
Phoebe, I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh  like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.
Phoebe, Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.
Phoebe,  This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering  please  if-if it’s not too much trouble  please  umm  might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham  please?
Phoebe, No no no  I’ll be nice  I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Phoebe, Ok  somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody  alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Phoebe, Hello  Hello. Ohh  OHH  she knew I could kick her ass.
Monica, Hey.
Ross, Hi. Mom. Dad.
Monica, Ha ha  a joke that’s funny in all countries.
Joey, What’s in it?
Joey, That’s not food...No  I don’t  no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Chandler, Joey  it’s been three days  okay.. Your just a little homesick  Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just  just try to enjoy yourself.
Joey,  Your different here too. Your mean in England. 
Ross, what’s up  Dad?
Ross, Dad  dad  please. Look I don’t want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright  she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.  Now here  here  let me go talk to him  okay?

Ross, Look  face it  my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Ross, I go back there with lawn ornaments  he’s going to laugh in my face.
Rachel,  Hi  Pheebs.
Phoebe,  Oh thank god. Oh  you changed your mind. Oh  look I know you probably want to be alone  and you don’t want to talk about it  that’s fine. I just want you to know  I think you are doing the right thing and...
Rachel,  Bye  Pheebs.
Phoebe,  Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!!  God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Chandler, I’d like to toast  Ross and Emily. Of course  my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding  so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast  if you will.  Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact  I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.  And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her.  Ohh  Dear God.. 
Phoebe, Oh  hi  Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men  or Ross’s sister Monica.
Phoebe, Oh  I’m Phoebe Buffay. I’m one of Ross’s best friends.

Chandler, The guy was hammered  okay? There’s no way  you look like Ross’s mother.
Monica, Then why would he say it?

Ross,  That-that-that’s all right  no honey  you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here.  She’s just fixing her makeup.
Ross, And  I love you!! 
Ross, That’s true  thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey  this is a party! Come on! Joey  dance!! 
Phoebe,  Uh  hello  this is Ross Geller’s personal physician  Dr. Philange.
Phoebe, Yeah  I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine  uh  now without it  uh  in the brain of Ross  uh women’s names are interchangeable  through-through no fault of his own.
Phoebe, No  not Phoebe  Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Phoebe, Hello?
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Oh wow  I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but  I know we had plans to meet up tonight and  ugh  I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Monica, I know. How could we have let this happen?
Chandler, Seven times!
Monica, Ugh! Well  y’know  we were away…
Chandler, In a foreign  romantic country…
Monica, I blame London.
Chandler, Bad London! 
Monica, So look umm  while we’re st-still in London  I mean  we can keep doing it right?
Chandler, Well  I don’t see that we have a choice. But  when we’re back home  we don’t do it.
Monica, Only here.
Chandler, Y’know  I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
Monica, I’ll meet you there in two minutes.
Chandler, Okay!
Rachel, Mon  honey  I gotta ask you something.
Monica,  Now?
Rachel, Ross said my name up there  I mean  come on  I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?
Monica, Oh  I-I don’t know.
Rachel, Monica  what should I do?
Monica, Just uh  do the right thing. 
Rachel, What?
Monica, Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! 
Rachel, Whoa  wait  listen  I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Monica, Wait. Rachel  no  he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that  I can’t help you.
Rachel, Okay  you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.
Joey, Hey  what’s up? 
Monica, Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Chandler, Forget it  that’s off.
Monica, Why?!
Monica, Joey  what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!
Joey, Well  I figured we’re in another country  so it doesn’t count.
Monica, That’s true.
Chandler, The man’s got a point.
Rachel, Oh  hi!
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, Hi. Sorry  things aren’t working out so well.
Ross, Oh no! It could be better  but it’s gonna be okay  right?
Rachel," Oh yeah! Of course  I mean  she’s gonna get over this  y’know? I mean  so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there  if you’d have seen a circus freak  you would’ve said  ""I take thee circus freak."" Y’know  it didn’t mean anything  it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?"
Ross, No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean  uh well  I can understand why Emily would think it meant something  y’know  because-because it was you…
Rachel, Right…
Ross, But it absolutely didn’t.  It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
Joey,  Ross  hey  the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily  so…
Ross,  Oh! Oh-oh  the band’s ready! Well  I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
Joey, You spit on me man! 
Ross, Look  I’m sorry.
Joey, Emily is kinda taking a long time  huh?
Rachel,  Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding  it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Ross, Oh  right!
Rachel, Get the hell out of there  y’know?
Ross,  Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. 
Rachel, Well  look at that  same thing.
Chandler," Listen  in the middle of everything if I scream the word  ""Yippee!"" just ignore me."
Monica, Oh my God  Rachel! Hi!
Chandler, Oh  hello Rachel.
Rachel, Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  Okay  don’t believe me  I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Chandler, Yes  we do. But  we have to change first.
Monica, Yes  I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?
Chandler, Yeah  we’ll be down in like five minutes.
Monica,  Fifteen minutes.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Hello? Oh  Pheebs!  It’s Phoebe!
Chandler, Oh  yay…
Monica, Great…
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, Hi  so what happened?
Rachel, Well  Ross said my name.
Phoebe, Yeah  I know  but I don’t think that means anything.
Rachel, Okay  Pheebs  y’know what  let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade  right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time  his obsession begins to grow. So then…
Chandler,  Hey  listen  why don’t we go change in my room?
Monica, But my clothes are—ohh! 
Chandler, Wow  you look…
Monica, No time for that!
Joey, Hey  dude  let me in. I got a girl out here!
Chandler, Well  I’ve got a girl in here.
Joey, No you don’t  I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Chandler, Well  we’re-we’re hanging out in here!
Joey, Look  which one of us is gonna be having sex in there  me or you?
Chandler, Well  I suppose I’d have to say you!! But  what if we’re watching a movie in here?
Monica, Which we are  and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!
Joey, My Giant? I love that movie!
Monica, You really think this is okay?
Chandler, Well  Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
Monica, Oh  it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know  I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.
Chandler, Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look  this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, Okay!
Ross,  Emily?!
Chandler, Nope  not under here!
Monica, You didn’t find her?
Ross, No  I’ve looked everywhere!
Chandler, Well  you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
Monica, Yeah  I think you should keep looking!
Chandler, Yeah  for about 30 minutes.
Monica, Or 45.
Chandler, Wow  in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
Ross, No! For all I know  she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No  from now on  I’m staying in one place.  Right here.
Monica, Well  it’s getting late.
Chandler, Yeah  we’re gonna go.
Ross, Actually  do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Monica, Ugh  y’know  umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Chandler, Yeah  it’s a very large plane.
Ross,  That’s cool.
Chandler, But  we’ll stay here with you.
Ross, Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this  y’know  but you don’t have to rub my butt.
Chandler, We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Monica, I know  I’ve been looking at those doors  they look pretty sound proof  don’t you think?
Chandler, We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know  let’s go for it.
Ross, Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily! 
Ross, Wait  well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Rachel,  Hey-hey  you guys oh hurry up  get some  there’s a whole cart outside… 
Ross, Now  hold on! Hold on!  Look  look  your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon  now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah  I said Rachel’s name  but it didn’t mean anything  Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!  That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please  promise me that you’ll tell her that.
Monica, Y’know  maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.
Chandler, Yeah  it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know  technically we still are over international waters.
Monica, I’m gonna go to the bathroom  maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?
Chandler, ‘Kay!
Joey, Can I ask you something?
Chandler, Uhh  no.
Joey," Felicity and I  we’re watching My Giant  and I was thinking  ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
Chandler, No.
Joey, I mean  the giant is like five years younger than me  y’know  you think I’ll ever get there?
Chandler, Yes.
Joey, Thanks man.
Chandler, Okay man. 
Joey, But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey, I mean  there’s no way I can make myself taller now  y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future  but Chandler  what if I die an unsuccessful  regular sized man?
Joey, Hey  Monica  wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Monica, I know!
Joey, Had the beef-tips  huh?
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hi!
Phoebe,  You ate meat!   You had sex! 
Chandler, No we didn’t!
Phoebe, I know you didn’t  I was talking about Monica.
Monica, Phoebe  I did not have sex.
Phoebe, This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Joey, All right  I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Phoebe, Oh  me too!
Joey, Why would you need to say hi to them  you’ve been feeding them for four days?
Phoebe, Oh right  maybe I’ll just go home.
Monica, Well  we certainly are alone.
Chandler, Yes! Good thing we have that  ‘Not in New York’ rule.
Monica, Right. Umm  listen since we’re-we-re on that subject  umm  I just wanted to tell you that uh  well  I-I was going through a really hard time in London  what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…
Chandler, Right.
Monica, Well  an-anyway  I just—that night meant a lot to me  I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.
Chandler, Oh. Y’know  that night meant a lot to me too  and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything  it just meant a lot to me ‘cause  you’re really hot! Is that okay?
Monica,  That’s okay.
Chandler, And I’m cute too.
Monica, And you’re cute too.
Chandler, Thank you!  All right  I gotta go unpack.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Bye.
Chandler,  I’m still on London time  does that count?
Monica, That counts!
Chandler, Oh  good! 
Ross, Rach! Rach!

Rachel, Yeah. I’m sorry.
Ross, I just  I don’t understand  I mean  how-how can she do this? Y’know  what  am I  am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?
Rachel, No  you’re not an idiot  Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.
Ross, Same difference.
Ross, I get it! Well  that’s that.
Rachel, No  you know what  I think you should go.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Yeah  I do. I think you should go  by yourself  get some distance  clear your head  I think it’d be really good.
Ross, Oh  I don’t  I don’t  I don’t know…
Rachel, Oh  come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!

Rachel, Well-well  I don’t know Ross—really?
Ross, Yeah  yeah  it’ll be great! You can  you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Rachel, Uh-huh.

Joey, Hey  it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler, I've had a very long  hard day.
Joey, Ahh  I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?

Phoebe,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey  Pheebs!
Joey, Mornin' Pheebs!
Phoebe, I have to tell you this story. Okay  I was coming over here and this driver…
Joey,  Was his name Angus? 
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Oh  he was this cab driver we had in London.
Phoebe, Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right  anyway…
Monica, Wait  what that place  that pub he took us too?
Chandler, Uh  The Wheatsheaf.
Joey, Yeah-yeah-yeah  and they had that beer! That uh…
Monica, Bodington's!
Chandler, Ooh! Ahh  Pheebs  was gonna tell a story.
Phoebe, Yeah  so  he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.
Ross,  Hey!
Joey, Hey  Ross  Bodington's!
Ross, Yeah! 
Joey, That was good beer.
Ross, Ohh…
Joey, Y'know  I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Ross, Y'know  I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Joey, Later! 
Ross, Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Monica, Yeah  but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually   she should be here by now.
Ross, Oh  so-so you talked to her. Did she  did she sound mad?
Monica, No  but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Ross, Okay  I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean  I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily  is my wife! Man  what is that?
Phoebe, So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Ross, No  not since I lost her at the airport.
Chandler, I can't believe she can out run you man!
Ross, HEY  SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!!  Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Rachel,  Hi!
Ross, Rach  Rach  I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Rachel, Oh Ross  come on! You just did what you had to do.
Ross, That's it? You're not mad? I mean  it must've been terrible.
Rachel, Terrible? Hell  I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach  met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. 
Ross, So  what? That's it?
Rachel, Well  yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross, Oh  thanks. Oh  you're the best. 
Rachel, Oh no  you're the best.
Ross,  Ohh  I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out  no one will tell me where Emily is  so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem  red roses to Emily's parent's house  one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Chandler, Oh  Ross  when you make out card; be sure to make it out to  EM-I-LY.
Monica, Rach  that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Rachel," What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay  I couldn't get a plane out  so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going  ""Oh  Mrs. Geller  why are you crying?"" I mean  it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean  it's all my fault! And you know why  because I make very bad decisions."
Chandler, Oh that's not true.
Rachel, Yes it is! It is true! I went  I went after Ross in stupid London.
Phoebe, London is stupid! Stupid!
Rachel, Phoebe  you were right. I should've never gone to London  and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Phoebe, Oh… No  I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Monica, I'll do it!
Rachel, That's fine. So Monica  you are now in control of my love life.
Chandler, Okay  I gotta go to work.
Chandler, And uh  Rachel  glad to have you back.
Chandler, Pheebs!  Always a pleasure. 
Monica, Oh  Rachel  sweetie  look  here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Rachel, Ohh  he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe it. 
Monica, Honey  sweetie  by the edges.
Rachel, I mean  y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it …
Monica, Ohh. 
Rachel, …I mean it's my fault.
Monica, Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Rachel, Oh my God! 
Monica, Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know  I know that wasn't about me.
Joey,  I bet it was about her a little.
Monica, If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean  look! Look  Gunther!  I mean  he's nice  he's cute.
Rachel, Yeah  I guess Gunther is kinda…
Monica,  Oh  what about that guy over there?  Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Rachel, Oh  I don't know. I don't know.
Monica, You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal  I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Rachel, All right  you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Joey, Say that to him and you're golden. 
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey  Pheebs!
Monica, We got out pictures back from London.  Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Phoebe,  Oh! Here we all are! Yeah  there's Ross and Joey and you and me. 
Chandler, All right  y'know what  we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Phoebe, No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff  it just bums me out.
Monica, What happened?
Rachel, Well  y'know  a little of this  a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Monica, See  didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Rachel, Well…
Monica, What took you so long?
Chandler, I got caught up and work  but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Monica, Oh  good.
Chandler, So  thanks for having me over! Rach.  Pheebs. 
Joey,  See ya!!  What the hell was that?!
Monica, Probably some y'know  European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel, That's not European!
Phoebe, Well  it felt French.
Rachel, Oh God  I really had a good time!
Rachel, Yeah. Umm  unless you wanna come inside?
Rachel, Okay. Oh  uh  wait a minute  y'know what? I uh  I can't decide this. Umm  okay  just hold on a second.
Rachel, Umm  hi!
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Ross, She's doing her laundry.
Rachel, What's that? 
Ross, It came in the mail today  it's uh  72 long-stemmed red roses  one for each day that I've known and loved Emily  cut up into mulch!
Rachel, Oh  honey that's awful.
Ross, Oh  it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Rachel, But  it's not raining.
Ross, I can't catch a break!
Rachel, Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right?  Hey  Dave!
Rachel, Umm  listen  I'm gonna need to take a rain check  my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye!  Honey  listen  I know  I know things seem so bad right now.
Monica,  Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Rachel, Yeah. 
Monica, What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Rachel, Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Monica, I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean  you listen to me! Now  I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Rachel, Well  ultimately  I was trying y'know  I-I wanted…tell him y'know  that I'm still in love with him.
Monica,  What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Rachel, Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Monica, I make the decisions  and I say no.
Rachel, Well  y'know what  no  you do not make my decisions because y'know what  you're fired.
Monica," You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say  ""I'm not fired!"" Ha!"
Rachel, Well… 
Monica, Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Joey,  Havin' some trouble?
Monica, Rachel locked the door.
Joey, I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Monica, Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica, Thank you. Rachel  can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel, No.
Monica, I really need to talk to you.
Rachel, Well  then talk!
Monica, Okay  I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Rachel, Yes!
Ross, What thing?
Monica, Well  Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous  she's never gonna get what she wants  and who knows who she might  end up hurting.
Ross, Monica's right  swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God  think of the massacre.
Rachel, I'm gonna do it.
Monica, All right  Rachel  I know-I know you think I'm crazy  please  before you tell him you love him  just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you  you can't.
Rachel, But I…
Monica, Please!
Rachel, All right  fine.
Monica, Joey  I'm in!
Joey,  All right. Good deal.
Joey, Uh  okay  Pheebs?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Joey, Umm  y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Joey, All right  well  we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Phoebe, Ohh  that's so nice! How great! Well  where? Where's the trip?!
Monica, Well  we thought we would all go to a picnic   in Central Park!
Phoebe,  Central… Park!
Joey, Yeah  all of us! All day!
Phoebe," That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well  it's right by my house  all right!"""
Chandler, Well  I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. 
Rachel,  Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there  Mr. Kissey! Y'know  I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole  little  new European thing you got going on  and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
Chandler, I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phoebe, That's fine  just don't bring it in my mouth.
Monica, Makes me wanna puke! 
Ross, Hey everybody  Pheebs is here!
Joey, Phoebe!
Chandler, Hey  Pheebs!
Rachel, Phoebe  woo!
Phoebe, Okay  woo! Hi.
Chandler, Okay  Pheebs  we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know  it didn't have any… It-it  well it blew. So  we thought  that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to  Atlantic City!
Phoebe, Ooh  Atlantic City! Oh  that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Joey, Mine!
Ross, Wait! It was my plan.
Joey, Nooo  I said we needed a new plan.
Ross, And  I came up with Atlantic City.
Joey, Which  is the new plan!
Monica, Okay  well  why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Phoebe, Okay! Ooh-ahh  I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Monica, Come on Rach  let's go.
Rachel, Yeah  y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Monica, No! Rachel  you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Rachel, Well  y'know what  that doesn't matter.
Monica, Okay  Rachel  do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Rachel, Yeah  I-I don't care.
Monica, Okay. I-I can't watch. 
Rachel, What 'cha readin'?
Ross, The paper.
Rachel, Yeah  what's it about?
Ross, Events from around the globe.
Rachel, Okay. Uhh  Ross  y'know what  there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you  but I think they're wrong. I mean  and you know how people can be wrong.
Ross, Sure. Once  at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…
Rachel, Okay  Ross  I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Go ahead.
Rachel, Umm  okay  I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh   I'm still in love with you Ross.
Ross, Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross, What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Rachel,  I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Ross, Why are you laughing?
Rachel," Because   because  I just heard it. I heard it  and it's ridiculous! I mean  you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous  and it's like  it's like when said it  I sort of like  I floated up out of my body  y'know? And  and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like  ""You are such an idiot!"""
Ross, Well  well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Rachel,  I'm sorry  that's not funny.
Ross," Actually  it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.  ""Hey Ross  where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know!"
Rachel, Oh God  ohh  okay  y'know what  do you think ah  do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Ross, Well  I kinda half to. I mean  because the thing is…
Rachel, The thing is y'know  that you're married to Emily.
Ross, That is what the thing is.
Rachel, Ross  things aren't gonna be weird between us  right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing  me telling you that?
Ross, No. No. No  I'm-I'm glad you did. Look  if nothing else  it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Rachel, That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. 
Ross, No thank you for… Thank you.
Ross, Okay  let's go!
Chandler, Atlantic City!
Phoebe, Atlantic City  baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey  high-five for rolling bones!
Joey, Uh  Pheebs  you're leaking?
Monica, Oh my God! You're water broke!
Phoebe, All right. Well  don't worry  I call shotgun! 
Chandler, Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Ross, Pheebs  Pheebs  the babies are coming now.
Rachel, High-five  the babies are coming! 
Phoebe, Wait  wait  remember when my water broke? 
Monica, I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Chandler, I know  it's beautiful. Amazing.
Chandler, Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room  I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Monica, Do you know anything about women?
Chandler, No.
Monica, That's all right.
Chandler, Okay. 
Phoebe,  Hi.
Phoebe, Hi  yeah  hi! I'm umm  Phoebe Buffay  and I have babies coming out of me.
Phoebe, Not yet. Umm  I heard they really hurt  do they hurt?
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Ross, It's all right.
Phoebe, Oh no  none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
Rachel, I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Joey, Okay  uh Pheebs  quick. Look! This  is for the babies to look at someday  so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Phoebe, Oh  okay  umm  hi kids! Um  it's me  Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
Ross, Hey  what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
Monica, Well  we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
Chandler, That's right.
Rachel, You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Monica, Oh man! I did it again!
Phoebe,  Okay  so umm  somebody has to call Frank and Alice.  And then my mom wants to know--Joey  what are you doing?!
Joey, I gotta get the before shot!
Rachel, Hi  Pheebs? Okay  so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh  she's not coming.
Phoebe, What?!
Ross, Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Phoebe, Oh my God  she's so stupid!
Ross, Look  Pheebs-Pheebs  it's gonna be okay.
Phoebe, That's easy for you to say  I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Rachel, Honey  listen  y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Ross, Yeah  he's head of the department.
Phoebe, All right—Ooh! Oh dead God  save me!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, I'm having my first contraction!
Chandler, Oh no.
Phoebe, Ooh  it's not bad.
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, Oh!  And so the miracle of life begins  and aaiiyyyeeee! 
Chandler, Hey! You okay?
Joey, Ooh  something hurts!
Phoebe, Ooh  it's sympathy pains. Ohh  that's so sweet!
Joey, Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Ross, Hello.
Chandler, Did he just say  he loves Fonzie?
Monica, That's what it sounded like.
Chandler, All right…
Phoebe, No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Chandler, Yeah  that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month  they give you 2% financing.
Rachel,  Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Joey, Oh my!
Rachel, They're male nurses.
Joey, Not in my head.
Rachel, Anyway  they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
Monica, Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
Rachel, What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on  and you're moving on with me. Come on  give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Monica, Umm  why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
Rachel, What?
Monica, Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Rachel, Okay  you're coming with me  and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Joey,  Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…
Rachel, Joey  how do you make that dirty?
Joey, Oh  it's easy. Yeah  I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh   Grandma's chicken salad…
Joey,  Ross! Get a shot of this.  Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay  now girl baby turn away and boy babies…  Check it out  huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right  now let's dive right into the good stuff. 
Phoebe, Oh  okay  I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh  yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh  I was kinda hoping that was it.
Ross, Hey  where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Joey, Oh  a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Chandler, Really? Male nurses?
Joey, Yeah  I was bummed too.
Chandler, So they're going on dates? When?
Joey, I think Saturday—.
Phoebe, Umm  sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first  but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
Phoebe, Hey.
Chandler, This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too  is that uh  is that another doctor?
Chandler, All right.
Phoebe, It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me  I'm y'know  dilatedamundo!
Ross, To be fair  he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
Phoebe,  What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Ross, Again  it's not that he…
Chandler,  Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Monica, Umm  listen there's something I think you should know.
Chandler, Oh  is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah  Joey already told me  and I am so-so fine. I mean  you and I we're just  y'know  we're nothing  we're goofin' around.
Monica, Umm  actually I was about to tell you that I was  I was going to get out of it  but hey  if we're just goofing around then uh  maybe I will go out with him.
Chandler, Fine! Maybe I will too!
Joey,  Hey  you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop.  Get up! Get up! Get up! 
Ross, Okay  Phoebe  this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
Phoebe, Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Phoebe,  Uh-huh  me too. Ross  maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Phoebe, Shh! Doogie  shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy  go!
Joey, Umm  well  what else could it be?
Joey, Or?
Phoebe, They are. Why?
Phoebe, Happy birthday!
Rachel, Honey  y'know I just gotta tell you  I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Phoebe, I know  it is.
Rachel, Yeah!
Phoebe, Can I tell you a little secret?
Rachel, Yeah!
Phoebe, I want to keep one. 
Rachel, Ohh  I'm gonna be on the news!
Rachel, Okay  Phoebe  honey  you gotta be kidding. I mean  you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
Phoebe, Why not?! Maybe I can  you don't know!
Rachel, Yes! Yes! Yes  I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
Phoebe, Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously  three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know  looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen  I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Rachel, Phoebe  no! This is  this is insane.
Phoebe, Oh  just ask him!
Rachel, Me?!
Phoebe, I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just  y'know  feel him out!
Rachel, No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
Phoebe, You're right.
Phoebe, Tell him it's for you.
Monica, Feeling a little better sweetie?
Joey, Well  maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Monica, Me too.
Ross,  Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Joey,  Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no  nothing is going up! Okay? Up  up is not an option—what's a urethra?  Are you crazy?!
Phoebe,  So did you ask him?
Rachel, No  I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Phoebe, Well  I'm kinda on a clock here.
Rachel, Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
Phoebe, Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Rachel, Yeah  but umm… Yes  but  Fonzie was already cool  so he wasn't hurt  right?
Monica,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hi!
Monica,  How are you doing?
Phoebe, Okay  doctor says any minute now.
Phoebe, Sorry Frank  I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.

Monica, Bye Dan!
Chandler, Bye  momi-moo.
Phoebe, What is that?
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Chandler, Yes!
Rachel, Oh  how does he look? How does he look?
Phoebe, I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Chandler, Oh God  kindergarten flashback.
Chandler, Okay  keep saying it!
Joey, Oh my God.
Ross, You did it  man.
Joey, They're so small! 
Monica, Great!
Chandler, So  are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica, Well uh  you and I are just goofing around  I thought  why not goof around with him.
Chandler, Y'know  I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary… Well  I have  and the technical definition is  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me  then we have to  y'know  get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
Monica, I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler, Really? Okay  so…
Monica,  Know when to stop.
Chandler, Y'know  I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica, Yeah. All right  I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.  Don't do the dance.
Chandler, Right!
Monica, I think you're my favorite.
Phoebe, Which one do you have?
Monica, I don't care.
Rachel,  Hi.  Hey  hi! So uh  Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Phoebe, But umm  I mean  did you talk to them about  y'know…
Rachel, Yeah  umm  no honey.
Phoebe, Oh. It was a long shot. Hey  you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
Phoebe, So  here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do  but they were wrong this is. Oh  I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay  I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool  but you lived in me. Okay  so we're cool. Yeah  we're gonna be great. Little high fives!  Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!  Well  if you're gonna cry. 
Monica, Phoebe  we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
Phoebe, I know.
Rachel, So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Phoebe, Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
Chandler, So uh  now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl  what are they gonna name her?
Phoebe, They're gonna call her Chandler.
Chandler, That's kind of a masculine name  don't you think?
Phoebe, Works on you.
Monica,  Come in. I've been waiting for you.
Rachel, Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God!  Oh my God!
Monica,  Okay  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um  I was taking a nap.
Rachel, Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica  tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Monica, Yes. Yes  I was. A guy. From work.  I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
Rachel,  That cute waiter guy from your restaurant  the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Monica, Uh-huh  that one!
Rachel, Y'know what  just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back  I want every little detail.  Maybe that's him. 
Monica,  Okay  umm  okay  umm…  It's just Joey and Ross.
Rachel, Why aren't you guys at the movie?
Joey, Well  we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
Ross, I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
Joey,  He's talking to London!
Monica, But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
Joey, Well no  not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Ross,  I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy  old twit!
Joey, Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
Chandler,  Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Oh no-no-no-no-no-no  vomit tux! No-no  vomit tux!
Joey, Don't worry  I had it dry-cleaned.
Monica, Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what  what you up to Joe?
Joey, Well  I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
Monica, Oh that's great!
Joey, A little uh  good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure  now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
Phoebe, Ugh  PBS!
Monica, What's wrong with PBS?
Phoebe, Ugh  what's right with them?
Joey, Why don’t you like PBS  Pheebs?
Phoebe, Okay  'cause right after my mom killed herself  I was just in this really bad place  y'know personally. So  I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street  'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Chandler, Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Phoebe, All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
Joey, I'm sorry Pheebs  I just  y'know  I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
Phoebe, This isn't a good deed  you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Joey, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you  having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
Phoebe, What-what are you talking about?!
Joey, Well  yeah  it was a really nice thing and all  but it made you feel really good right?
Phoebe, Yeah. So?
Joey, It made you feel good  so that makes it selfish. Look  there's no unselfish good deeds  sorry.
Phoebe, Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Joey, Well  may I ask for one example?
Phoebe, Yeah  it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!
Joey, That's because all people are selfish.
Phoebe, Are you calling me selfish?!
Joey, Are you calling you people?  Yeah  well sorry to burst that bubble  Pheebs  but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
Phoebe, I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you  you evil genius.
Ross,  Hello.
Ross, Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God  it's Emily!  It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst!  Hi!
Ross, No wait! Look  wait! Okay  you can hang up  but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna  I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Ross, Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Ross,  She's talking.
Phoebe, Hey  Joey  when you said the deal with Santa Clause  you meant?
Joey, That he doesn't exist.
Phoebe, Right. 
Rachel, So Chandler  have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Chandler, Uhh  yeah. She uh  she uh  she uh might've mentioned him.
Rachel, So Mon  when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
Monica, Ohh  he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Chandler, Yeah  I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Rachel, I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
Chandler, Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
Monica, I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
Chandler, Because I'm very happy for him!  And you  you lucky dog!
Ross,  Hi!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Well  Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
Chandler, Yes!
Monica, That's great!
Ross, In London!
Monica, What?!
Ross, She wants me to move to London.
Monica, But you live here!  You know that.
Rachel, What-what-what are you gonna do?
Ross, I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
Monica, Yeah  I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
Ross, It could happen.
Joey,  How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
Joey, That's great. But uh  I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
Joey, But I'm the host!
Joey, You don't seem to understand. See  I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Phoebe, I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well  I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Rachel, Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
Phoebe, I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
Chandler,  Hey  Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Monica, Sure!
Chandler, If you're cooking on the stove  does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Rachel, Chandler!  Is he?
Monica, Well  y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
Chandler, Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had  I'd be going like this. 
Ross, All right Emily  as much as I love you  I'm sorry  I can't move to London without Ben.
Ross, Yeah  would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway  why can't you just do that?
Ross, Oh-oh-okay  but-but I know  that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now  I mean  I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
Ross, All right  did you just say all right?
Ross, Oh  Emily that is  that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
Ross, Yes  tell me.
Ross, I know. I am  I am so sorry.
Ross, Again  very sorry.
Ross, Emily  there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
Ross, Oh that is so great! That's…
Ross, So I asked Emily if she would come to New York  and she said yes.
Chandler, Yes!
Phoebe, Ooh-ohh!
Monica, Great!
Ross, No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
Phoebe, Why?
Monica, What?! You can't—what did you tell her?
Ross, I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean  how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!
Chandler, Well  you can't just not see Rachel anymore  she's one of your best friends.
Monica, Yeah! But  he can't not exactly see Emily  I mean that's his wife.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Chandler, That's true!
Phoebe, Yeah  but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
Chandler, That's true!
Monica, No  you cannot.
Ross, Thanks for the help  problem solved. 
Monica,  Hello.
Joey,  Hey Mon!
Monica, Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day  when are you gonna be on TV?
Joey, See  there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office  but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
Monica,  You're not on TV.
Joey, Oh  uh  okay  how  how about now? 
Chandler, Hey  there he is! There he is!
Joey, Hello New York! 
Chandler, How many times have I told you guys  you never watch the cooking channel!
Monica,  Hi Chandler.
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Uh  listen  I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
Chandler, Oh that was yours? Uh  yeah  we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Monica, William Sonoma  fall catalog  Page 27.
Chandler, Expect it in 4-6 weeks.  Umm  hey  umm  Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day  we have the whole place to ourselves.
Monica, Yeah  so?
Chandler, Well I just  thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Monica, Y'know what  champ? I think I'll pass.
Chandler, Why?
Monica, Why? 
Chandler, What's your point?
Joey,  PBS telethon.
Phoebe,  Hey Joey  I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
Joey, What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
Phoebe, Well  it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Joey, Now  y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
Phoebe,  Aw  dammit! 
Joey, Hey  excuse me  would you mind switching with me?
Joey, Come on man! You've been here all day!
Ross,  Okay  that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult  so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. 
Monica, A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious  you can't make this decision with a toy!
Phoebe, Ooh  it's not a toy.
Ross, Well  I don't know what else to do. I mean  I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion  let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right  don't be shy  any suggestion will do.  Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball  should I never see Rachel again?  Ask again later. Later is not good enough.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
Monica, All right  let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
Joey,  PBS Telethon.
Phoebe,  Hi Joey.
Joey, Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
Joey, $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean  after what Sesame Street did to ya?
Phoebe, Oh  I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves  so by supporting them  I'm doing a good thing  but I'm not happy about it. So there  a selfless good deed.
Joey, And you don't a little good about donating the money?
Phoebe, No  it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
Joey, A hamster? What  those things are like 10 bucks.
Phoebe, Yeah  not the one I had my eye on.
Phoebe, Oh  look-look  Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! 
Chandler,  Look  maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best  it's only because you've made me the best.
Monica, Keep talking.
Chandler, I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you  and we're together  OH…MY…GOD.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Oh-aw my God! Now  I understand if you never want to sleep with me again  but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it  to sex!
Monica, Well  if we owe it?  Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?
Chandler, Well  I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no  leave the gloves on.
Monica, But  I just cleaned the bathroom.
Chandler, Yeah  why don't we lose the gloves.
Monica, Yeah. 
Chandler, All right  let's show them how it's done.
Monica, Okay.
Monica, Ow!
Chandler, Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Monica, I know!
Rachel,  Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
Ross, For what?
Rachel, For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
Ross, Yeah  I uh  totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Rachel, Sure. I guess. Hey  I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
Ross, It's not that easy  there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Rachel, Like what?
Ross, Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Rachel, Well  why don't you talk to me about it  maybe I can help.
Ross, No. No. You-you can't help. I mean  I kinda have to do this without your help.
Rachel, Well  I-I know you can do that too. I'm just  I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!
Ross, Thanks.
Rachel, Ross? Look  whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants  just give it to her. Come on  the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  I mean  you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
Ross,  Hello.  Hi sweetie.  Good. Look umm  yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and  I can do it.  So will you come to New York? 
Monica, Never done that before.
Chandler, Nope.
Monica,  Hi!
Chandler,  Hi! 
Joey, Monica? What time is it?
Chandler, Uhh  9. 
Joey, But it's dark out.
Monica, Well that's because you always sleep to noon  silly! This is what 9 looks like.
Joey, I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise. 
Monica, I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
Chandler, I know  me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
Monica, All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
Chandler, Yeah  I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Monica, Ohh  I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
Chandler, Okay  y'know your not though. Let's go. 
Monica, Wait! What about Joey?
Monica,  Hey  guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
Phoebe, Oh weird  Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Monica, Oh now that-that-that's funny  it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
Chandler, I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Ross,  Hey.
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Hey.
Ross, Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
Monica, No  she's out shopping.
Ross, Damn!
Chandler, What's going on?
Ross, I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know  talk to Rachel about it.
Phoebe, Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just  you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Ross," Well look  I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my wife "" part  all right? And not the part that makes me do this. "
Monica, Wow  so you guys are  you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
Ross, I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Joey, Doesn’t seem like it's going to work  I mean…
Rachel,  Hi  guys!
Joey, Hi!
Chandler, Uh  hey!
Rachel, What's going on?
Chandler, We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Joey, So I'm thinking  basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Phoebe, Yeah that's better than my way.
Rachel, Oh okay  hey guys  would you flip mine too?
Chandler, Aww  man! 
Rachel,  Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Ross, So  Rach  y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Rachel, Oh yeah! I know.
Phoebe,  Can you hear anything?
Chandler," Oh yes  somebody just said  ""Can you hear anything?"""
Monica, Hey  Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Joey,  Well  remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well  when Ross said Rachel at the wedding  I figured it was gonna happen again  so I hid this in here.
Monica, Ooh  candy bars  crossword puzzles…
Phoebe, Ooh  Madlibs  mine! 
Chandler, Condoms?
Joey, You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Chandler, And condoms are the way to do that?
Ross, Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this  the last time I talked to Emily…
Rachel,  Oh my God! My dog died!
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Oh my God  Le Poo  our dog!
Ross, Le Poo's still alive?!
Rachel, Oh God  it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh.  Oh my God.
Monica, Sweetie  we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Rachel, It's Le Poo.
Phoebe, I know it's le poo right now  but it'll get better.
Chandler,  I can't believe it! We're here!
Monica, Ooh  chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Chandler, Oh  you should live with Joey  Roll-os everywhere.
Monica, Come here.  Okay  be right back.
Chandler, Oh yes! Monica  get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
Monica, We're switching rooms.
Chandler,  Oh dear God  they gave us glasses!
Monica, No  they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean  if they didn't change the glasses  who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie  I just want this weekend to be perfect  I mean we can change rooms  can't we?
Chandler, Okay  but let's do it now though  because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! 
Ross, Hey  so uh  y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Rachel, Oh yeah! 
Ross, Well  y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well  there's this one thing… Okay   here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
Rachel, What?
Ross, You're nose is bleeding!
Rachel, Oh God.  No! Oh not again!  This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry.  Oh  okay  so I'm sorry  what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Ross, Umm… 
Rachel, Sorry. Sorry.
Ross, Okay  I uh  I can't see you anymore.
Rachel, Yeah  I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Chandler, Okay  great. 
Chandler, Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Monica, We're switching rooms again.
Chandler, What? Why?
Monica, This is a garden view room  and we paid for an ocean view room.
Monica,  Excuse me  umm  can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Chandler, Uh-huh. 
Monica, Chandler!
Chandler,  Yeah.
Monica, Look  these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Chandler, I hear ya  Mugsy! But look  all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect  magical weekend together with you.
Monica, Okay  this one I like!
Chandler,  Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Monica, Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Chandler, Oh  I'm sorry  am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Monica, Hey  don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Chandler, Oh  who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
Monica, I don't know  how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Chandler, Do not speak ill of the dead.
Monica, We're supposed to uh  be spending a romantic weekend together  it-it  what is the matter with you?
Chandler, I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez  relax mom.
Monica, What did you say?
Chandler," I said  ""Geez  relax Monnnnn."""
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey. Rachel  I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really  I just have to get it out.
Rachel, Okay  what's up?
Ross, Okay  y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Rachel, Yeah  I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
Ross, And while that was good advice  you should know that what-what she wants…
Rachel, Yeah?
Ross, …is for me not to see you anymore.
Rachel, That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?   Oh God. Ohh  you already agreed to this  haven't you?
Ross, It's awful I know  I mean  I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do  I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Rachel, Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news  Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
Ross, You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Rachel, Oh yeah  really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay  well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
Ross, What are you doing?
Rachel, Storming out!
Ross, Rachel  this is your apartment.
Rachel, Yeah  well that's how mad I am!!
Chandler, Damn Rollos!
Joey, Hey  you're back!
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, How was your conference?
Chandler, It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know  the entire time. Are you kidding with this? 
Joey, Oh  so your weekend was a total bust?
Chandler, Uh  no  I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Monica,  Hi!
Joey, Hey  you're back too!
Monica, Yeah. Umm  Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Joey, Hey  how was your chef thing?
Monica, Oh  it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Chandler, Well  maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Monica, Chandler! 
Chandler, Monica. 
Monica, Okay  I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Chandler, Okay  fine  $300.
Monica, 300 dollars?!
Chandler, Yeah  just think of it as $25 per room!
Monica, Urghh!!
Joey,  What are you guys woofing about?
Monica, Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
Joey, Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it  I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
Ross, You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
Joey, You want my advice?
Ross, Yes! Please!
Joey, You're not gonna like it.
Ross, That's okay.
Joey, You got married to fast.
Ross, That's not advice!
Joey, I told ya.
Ross, I'm going to the bathroom. 
Joey, Man  if anyone asked me to give up any of you  I couldn't do it.
Monica, Maybe I could do it.
Rachel,  Hi!
Joey, Hi  Rach.
Chandler, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Rachel, Look  I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know  I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
Joey, I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category  but uh  Ross is right back there. 
Rachel, That's not Ross!
Phoebe, Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
Chandler, Okay  Ross is in the bathroom.
Rachel, Oh my God  its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
Joey, Hey  you're not Kip!
Rachel,  Do you even know who Kip is?
Joey, Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?
Chandler, Kip  my old roommate  y'know we all used to hang out together.
Joey, Oh  that poor bastard.
Rachel, See? Yeah  you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
Monica, You're not gonna be phased out!
Rachel, Well  of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh  it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Phoebe, Ehh!!
Rachel, Honey  come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Chandler,  Hey!
Joey, Hey  Mr. Bing. That uh  hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Chandler, Yes that was mine.
Joey, 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Chandler, Yes that would have made more sense.
Joey, Y'know  I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right  look  I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say  I'll believe ya.  Were you  or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Rachel, Phoebe?  I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing.  You gotta come with me!
Phoebe, Come where?
Rachel, Wherever I go. Come on you and me  we'll-we'll start a new group  we're the best ones.
Phoebe, Okay  but try and get Joey too.
Ross,  Pheebs  you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Phoebe, Oh  sure!  Bye Ross!  Forever.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
Ross, I talked to Monica  look  I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change  so I should be the one to y'know  step back.
Rachel, Oh  Ross…
Ross, No  no  it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is  is that better?
Rachel, No  it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
Ross, Well  what-what would you do? Rach  if you were me  what-what would you do?
Rachel, Well  for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
Ross, I can't believe this is happening.
Rachel, I know.
Ross, I am so sorry.
Rachel, I know that too.
Joey,   Hey  Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm  Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Hi.
Chandler, I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked  huh?
Monica, Yeah  it did.
Chandler, So  I guess this is over.
Monica, What?
Chandler, Well  y'know  you and me  it had to end sometime.
Monica, Why  exactly?
Chandler, Because of the weekend  we had a fight.
Monica, Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! 
Chandler, So  this isn't over?
Monica,  You are so cute! No. No  it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Chandler, Really? Okay. Great!
Monica, Ohh  welcome to an adult relationship! 
Chandler,  We're in a relationship?
Monica, I'm afraid so.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh hey  Monica  I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Monica, Yeah  I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Monica, Hey  Rach  can I borrow your eyelash curler  I think I lost mine.
Rachel, Yeah  it's in there. 
Joey,  Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Chandler, Joey  can I talk to you for a second? 
Joey, Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Joey, Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
Chandler, Yes. Yes. 
Joey,  You?!  And-and you?!
Monica, Yes  but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey, How?! When?!
Chandler, It happened in London.
Joey, IN LONDON!!!
Chandler, The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Chandler, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica, Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone  okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Joey, All right! Man  this is unbelievable! I mean  it's great  but…
Monica, I know  it's great!
Joey, Aww  I don't want to see that!
Phoebe, We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
Phoebe," The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win  you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say  ""Hi  Phoebe!"""
Monica, Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know  it doesn't count.
Phoebe, Count for what?
Monica, Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Joey, I guess I'm done.
Chandler, Fun's over!
Monica, Wait-wait  guys! If-if we follow the rules  it's still fun and it means something!
Rachel, Uh-huh!
Joey, I think I'm gonna take-off.
Monica, Guys  rules are good! Rules help control the fun!  Ohhh! 
Joey,  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that  not while you're living under my roof!
Monica, What?!
Joey, Look  just because I know about you two  doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Chandler, Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Joey, Well  I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay  look  if I have to pretend I don't know about you two  then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Monica, Sorry.
Chandler, Sorry.
Joey,  I can hear that!
Monica,  Rachel's at work.
Joey, I can still hear you!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hello!
Monica, Hey  what's that?
Phoebe, Yeah  my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family  and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Phoebe, Eeeee--ohh!! God! 
Joey, Argh-argh!!  Ooh  soft. Is this mink?
Phoebe, Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus  I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
Chandler, Yeah  just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen  I made that up!
Ross,  Hey!
Ross, How come? Everybody else does.
Monica, What is that?
Ross, Oh  umm  I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Monica,  This is all of your things.
Ross, Yes  yes it is! No  but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours  together. Y'know brand new.
Monica, So basically  this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Ross, Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Joey, Hey  Ross  you're okay with that?
Ross, Look  if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York  I'm sure everything will be fine.
Chandler, Okay  but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Ross, After what I did? Can you blame her?
Phoebe, Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed  she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
Joey,  What is he doing? What  Emily  thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Monica, Now calm down Joey.
Joey, No! Everything's gettin' all messed up  y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel  we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel  hence Ross stops seeing us!
Phoebe, Oh  I hate this. Everything's changing.
Chandler, Yeah I know  we're losing Ross  Joey said hence…
Monica, Look  I'm not happy about this either  but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Joey, No! But y'know  I'm an actor  I'll act cool.
Rachel, Ohh  whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica  come on please hurry up honey! Please?
Monica, Rachel  if you want the little round waffles  you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
Rachel, I want the little round waffles.
Monica, All right.  Op  here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Rachel, Okay  y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
Rachel, Arghhhh!!!!!!
Monica, Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
Phoebe, I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
Joey, I'll take it!
Phoebe, That might work! 
Joey, Ooh-ooh-ooh  yeah!  Enh? All right  what do you think?
Chandler, You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
Ross,  No-no-no  it's just a bit sudden.  No  it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too  all righty. Bye. 
Joey, What's the matter Ross?
Ross, Nothing. Oh  actually  great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Phoebe, Why?
Ross, Well  her thought is  and I agree  fresh new furniture  why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet  it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Joey, That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Chandler, So you're really okay with this?
Ross, Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work  but uh  y'know  I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Chandler, Now that's so funny  because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Joey, Now he's movin'? Man  what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Rachel, You guys! You guys!
Monica, We were  we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Rachel, It was like this crazy-eyed  hairy beast man! He was like a  like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Monica, And he came at us with an axe  so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Rachel,  Yeah  I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Joey, Uhh  like dark hair  bushy beard?
Rachel, Yeah!
Joey, Yeah  you fogged Danny.
Rachel, Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Joey, Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah  he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Monica, Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know  you always stick up for the people we fog!
Rachel, Hi! You might not remember us  but we are the girls that fogged you.
Monica, We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Rachel, Hi! Just so you know  we-we didn't mean to fog you  we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Rachel, Hi! Sorry to bother you  but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology  it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Monica, Yeah.
Monica, Wow! That guy is so rude!
Rachel, Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Monica, Well you did a little bit.
Rachel, Oh my God  honey  I'm so sorry!
Monica, I totally forgive you!
Rachel, Really?
Monica, Yes!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, So listen  you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Monica, Crematorium Chris? Sure!
Phoebe, He says  that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm  y'know  bring in the next person I know who dies.
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God  look at these pelts!
Monica, Don't get too attached  she's having it cremated.
Rachel, What? Uhh  Phoebe  honey  honey  I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it  we all do actually  but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature  fashion!
Phoebe, This is fashion?!  Okay  so to you  death is fashion?! That's really funny.  Here's Phoebe umm  sporting uh  y'know  cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know  the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean  you really thing this looks good?  'Cause I do.
Ross,  I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. 
Chandler, Okay  what is in here? Rocks?
Ross, No-no  this is my collection of fossil samples.
Chandler, So  rocks.
Ross, I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know  Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there. 
Joey, Ohh. Hey  remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
Ross, I loved this place! To tell you the truth  I wish I didn't have to move.
Joey, Uhh  are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Ross, Well  I mean if uh  if Emily gave me a choice…
Joey, You do have a choice!! Ross  why are you listening to her?! Are you  are you crazy?!
Ross, Why?
Joey, It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look  now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy  right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
Ross, What's going on?
Joey, We all hate Emily!
Phoebe, Nooo!!
Monica, No  Ross  we do not hate Emily. We-we just  we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Look  we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Joey, Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Ross, Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right  it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing  happy  candy in the sky  drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life  okay? It's what grown-ups do! 
Phoebe, I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
Monica, God  I feel so guilty about Ross.
Phoebe, Oh  I know.
Joey, I kinda feel like it's my fault.
Chandler, Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Joey, Well  I'm keeping so many things to myself these days  something was bound to slip out! 
Chandler, Well  I think it's very brave what you said.
Phoebe, All right  I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. 
Chandler, Pheebs  what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Phoebe, Well  I've been reading up and for your information  minks are not very nice. Okay  I admit it! I love this coat! Okay  I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me  including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, What? Yeti—I mean Danny?
Rachel, Oh. Listen  I'm so sorry. I would  I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.
Rachel,  What?
Rachel, What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
Rachel, So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well  you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
Rachel, Well  y'know  if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
Rachel, And stop saying that! I hate that!
Rachel, Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
Rachel, What?!
Rachel, Okay. Okay.
Chandler, Uh  Ross?
Phoebe, Are you still mad at us?
Ross, Yep.
Phoebe," Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song."
Ross, Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Joey, Look  Ross  I feel really bad. I mean  you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Chandler, Yeah  we are so sorry.
Phoebe,  You're kinda stepping on the song. 
Joey, Look  we were way out of line  we totally support you.
Monica, Whatever you decide  whatever you do.
Phoebe, Okay  now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Ross, Look  this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Phoebe, Yes! Exactly! And that's why…
Monica, Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Ross, Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Phoebe, Okay  let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Joey, Hey  y'know Ross  I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
Ross, You do  huh?
Joey, Yeah you see umm  well  I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me  y'know  you wander around  you're alone…
Ross, What are you talking about?
Joey,  I'm not sure.
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Hey  look at you! Where have you been?
Rachel, Oh  I went to have pizza. With Danny.
Monica, How did that happen?
Rachel, That yeti is one smooth talker.
Monica, I hope you're not full  'cause dinner's almost ready.
Rachel, Yeah  y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
Rachel, Come on you guys! Listen  if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay  I really… I don't mind.
Ross, Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
Rachel, Ross  I…
Joey, RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
Rachel, Okay. Okay. Joey  it's okay. Settle down.
Joey, All right  I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor…
Ross, Hey! Hey  look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
Rachel, I haven't seen him in so long!
Phoebe, Oh God  I really missed that fat bastard!
Monica, Wow  this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Joey, It's almost as if he knew.
Monica, I'll get it.  Hello.  Hi Emily!  Yeah  uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second. 
Ross, Hey!  Yeah-yeah  we're just having dinner.  Uh  yeah  sure uh hold on.  She wants to say hi.  Hold on.
Phoebe, Hi Emily!
Chandler, Hi!
Joey, Well uh  I don't know about who's here  but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Ross, Y'know what? Uh  Rachel is here! 
Chandler, Oh yeah  there-there she is!
Ross, Yeah  yeah  she's here.
Ross,  Hi.
Ross,  Look Emily  I'm just having dinner with my friends  okay?
Ross, Emily that's ridiculous. Look  I'm-I'm moving for you  I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please  just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay  you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
Ross, Well  you can't know where I am all the time. Look  this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
Ross, So  can you trust me?
Joey, I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
Monica, How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
Joey, You can totally tell! Here look  watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! 
Ross, Well  I guess that's it.
Joey, What happened? What happened?
Ross, My marriage is over.
Monica, Oh  sweetie. Oh  look at you. You're shivering.
Phoebe, Here. 
Rachel, Ross  honey  is there anything we can do?
Ross, Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Phoebe,  Okay  stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay  they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know  okay  most of these probably wanted to be coats!  All right  fine  now I get it.  Here.  You take it.  Are you happy now? I'm cold!
Chandler, Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
Joey, No  look. 
Chandler, That's a pig.
Joey, I know  I know  but look at the knobs on her.
Chandler, Hey! 
Ross, Emily's cousin kicked me out!
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Why?
Ross, Well  when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce  sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
Chandler, How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Ross, Who needs a lease when it's family!
Joey, Hey  you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Chandler, Oh  yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, You got it.
Joey, Okay.
Ross, Thanks you guys  I really appreciate this. All right  I'm gonna get packing again. Man  I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Ross, What?
Chandler, He thought you said gonad.
Monica, Oh  Larry.
Phoebe, Umm  do health inspectors work on commission?
Phoebe, It's okay to laugh right?
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica, Okay  knock yourself out  Larry.
Phoebe, Yum-my!
Monica, Larry?
Phoebe, Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
Monica, Uh  look  Larry honey  umm  I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Monica, It's in the kitchen  I'll go get it.
Phoebe, Hey  you should really read that book you wrote.  Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
Phoebe, Yeah  but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
Phoebe, Okay  she would love that! Y'know  'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, He's so funny! 
Monica, Thanks.
Rachel, Thank you.  Mon?
Monica, Hmm?
Rachel, How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
Monica, He's not great umm  but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute  you're not gonna try…
Rachel, Oh  honey  please  no  I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean  he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know  I don't  I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Monica, Right  you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
Monica,  Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
Rachel, I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway  we flirt  I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha  and nothing.
Rachel, Hi Danny!  Wow! Thirsty huh?
Monica, Ohh  fun!
Rachel, Ohh  great!
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Well  I guess we won't be warming his house.
Rachel,  Okay. All right  I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out  because he wants me to ask him out.
Monica, And you're not gonna do that.
Rachel, That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh  coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know  trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face  didn't it?
Monica, So-so there is no party.
Rachel, No  there's a party. There's a party. But the power  that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
Monica, I think so. Se  he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
Rachel, Exactly.
Joey, Ross?
Ross,  Hey roomies!
Chandler, Love what you've done with the place.
Ross, Oh  yeah I know  I know  it's a lot of boxes  but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Joey, Not a problem. And listen  hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while  why don't—I was thinking we uh  put your name on the answering machine.
Chandler, Oh yeah!
Ross, Oh  I uh  hope you don't mind  I kinda uh  jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will  we will  call you back!
Joey, Hey  all right!
Ross, Pretty cool  huh?
Joey,  You're fake laughing too  right?
Chandler, Oh  the tears are real.
Phoebe,  Show me the badge again.
Phoebe, Shiny.
Phoebe,  You are just nonstop!
Phoebe, Why?!
Phoebe,  You have the power to do that?
Phoebe,  Shut it down.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, What are you doing?
Joey, Nothing.
Chandler, You built a fort didn't ya?
Joey,  Kinda.
Chandler,  Oh my God  the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was 
Joey, Dude  you should've gone out once and a while.
Chandler, I hate this thing!
Joey, Come on  Chandler  Ross is our friend. He needs us right now  so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
Rachel, Oh  hi Danny.
Monica, Oh  thanks! We'll try to stop by.
Rachel, Uh  actually  I think I'm gonna be busy.
Monica, You are?
Rachel, Yeah! Remember I got that uh  gala.
Rachel, It's a uh  regatta gala.
Rachel, No-no  but I support it.
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.  Walked right into that one didn't he?
Monica, What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Rachel," Yeah  but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes  he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said  ""No!"" Which puts me right back in the driver seat."
Monica, Great. So the ball is in his court?
Rachel, Ball? There is no ball.
Ross,  Joey  please! 
Joey, Sorry.
Joey, Ahhhhhhhhhh…
Chandler,  Hello children!
Joey, Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
Chandler, Okay. 
Joey, No-no  no! We have to move the table into my room  yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
Joey, All right  I have one question. What is the deal with this? 
Chandler, Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
Joey, No  the quiet down thing!
Chandler, You mean this. 
Joey, Um-hmm! Look  I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
Chandler,  All right look  y'know  this maybe tough but come on  this is Ross! I survived college with him!
Joey, All right  I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, No-no-no-no!
Joey, YES!!
Ross,  Uh fellas  
Chandler, Okay  so he's out of here.
Joey, Um-hmm.
Joey,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Joey, You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Phoebe, Oh  I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Joey, Pheebs  if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places  where are we gonna eat?!
Monica, I don't know  clean places?
Joey, Umm  yum!
Monica,  It's Danny.
Rachel, Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
Monica,  We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
Rachel, What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
Monica, The fake kind!
Monica, We have a ladle. 
Monica, Okay  great!
Phoebe," Hey  guys  you know what Larry would say? He would say  ""See you ladle."" "
Chandler, Well  I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Ross, I'll take sports.
Joey, Mine! 
Ross, All right. Uhh  international.
Joey, Oh that's mine too!  I'm Italian!
Ross, Well  I guess I can check out those apartment listings  even though there's never anything in here.
Chandler, Not even on page 7?
Ross,  Oh yeah! You're—hey  you're right! Here's an affordable place   two bedroom  close to work  ooh  it's available in five weeks!
Chandler, What about that circled one?
Ross, Oh  I-I don't know  it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Joey, But it's available now! Isn't it?
Chandler, Yes  it is.
Joey, Hey  let's go look at it! 
Ross, Okay  let's go.
Joey, Okay!
Chandler, There we go!
Ross, Oh-oh-ooh  hey guys  I was wondering if you guys would uh  maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all  we all are using it.
Chandler, Let's go quicker.
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Oh my God! 
Chandler, Yeah  well look at this kitchen  slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Joey, Somebody was using his head. Hey  let's check out the rest of the place.
Ross, I think this is it. I don't know  maybe we should keep looking.
Joey, But hey  Ross  this place is available now!
Chandler, Yeah  you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross,  So  you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
Joey, Oh  it's perfect!
Ross,  How about you?
Chandler, It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
Ross, All right  I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh  I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
Chandler, We are bad people.
Joey, He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew!  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Phoebe, Ooh  absolutely!
Phoebe, Ooh  I love that place!  So  no.
Phoebe, Enh. Sure!
Phoebe, Oh  no-no  this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today  'cause I was thirsty for milk  y'know.  Okay  let's go!
Phoebe, Okay  stop! Larry  okay  can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like  okay  so where are we gonna eat ever?
Phoebe, Thank you.  Okay  go! Go! Go!   Now  if after dinner you still really need to bust someone  I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Joey, Maybe  maybe we did a good thing  helping Ross get back on his feet!
Chandler, Yes that was a nice place!
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Not a lot of closet space  but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, What are we gonna do?
Joey, I don't know. Maybe pizza?
Chandler, About Ross!
Joey, Oh! Oh!
Joey, Hello!  Oh yeah!  It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah  he's very reliable.
Chandler,  Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh  barks into the night.  Well  who doesn't love dogs?  Ah  he's a tap dancer!  Yes  some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes  he's a pimp. He's a big  tap dancing pimp!  Hello?
Chandler, Ohhhhh!
Rachel, Shoot  shoot  this is never gonna work! He's right there!
Monica, Just go over and say hi.
Rachel, No  I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Monica, Hey  Danny!
Monica,  Oh  it's a great party! Great food. Y'know  most parties it's all chips and salsa  chips and salsa.   So umm  what's this? 
Monica, Ooooh!  And-and-and what-what's this? 
Monica,  Oh.
Rachel, Hey! Oh right  tonight was your party.
Rachel, Oh well  y'know  the gala had to end sometime.
Rachel, Yeah  sure.  All right  whose court is the ball in now?
Monica, I thought there wasn't a ball?
Rachel, Oh  come on! He's glad that I came  he doesn't want me to go anywhere  balls flying all over the place!
Rachel, Oh  go on! You telling people about me?
Rachel,  Yeah  okay  at ease solider!
Rachel, No  it's all right  you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!
Rachel," Yeah  yeah  you go talk to your friend. You tell him  ""Nice try."""
Rachel, Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!
Monica, I think I need a drink.
Rachel, Yeah!
Chandler, 98. 99. 100. Okay  go!
Joey,  Dude  I'm telling ya! I'm fine! 
Chandler, Here we go! Here we go!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Hey. So I uh  I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
Joey, You're kidding!
Chandler, You're kidding  no!
Ross, Yeah. But  the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
Joey, But you can't stay with Phoebe  Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Ross, Look  you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
Joey, Well  we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there  by-by that speaker. Please  just stay!
Chandler, Yeah!
Ross, Are you guys sure about this?
Joey, Definitely!
Chandler, Yes! Ross  you have to stay!
Ross, All right.
Joey, All right!
Chandler, All right  buddy!
Ross, So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look  I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass  but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Chandler, Well  I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Ross,  Come on  it's fun!
Chandler, All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey, Dude  stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Rachel, Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
Ross, I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Joey, I need something sweet.
Phoebe, Does anyone wanna watch TV?
Phoebe, Monica your remote doesn't work.
Monica, Phoebe  you have to lift it and point.
Phoebe, Oh. Aw  forget it.
Rachel, Yeah  you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
Joey, Ooh-ooh  I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Monica, That's very nice.
Chandler, That's sweet  Joey.
Joey, Yeah  the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me  I'm also thankful for thongs. 
Joey, I mean  it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean  it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
Chandler, Are you aware that you're still talking?
Monica, Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
Ross, Huh  I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
Phoebe, Wow! See  and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
Ross, I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
Chandler, No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Rachel, Oh  you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
Ross, Oh God  no.
Joey, Oh  come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
Chandler, It's a tradition  like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay  moved out  and abandoned its entire family.
Ross, You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
Phoebe, I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Chandler," Really? Worse than  ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?"""
Phoebe, Oh  did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes  mine's worse!
Ross, In this life  Phoebe.
Phoebe, Oh  this life! Oh okay no  Chandler's is worse.
Joey, Man  it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
Phoebe, Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
Rachel, I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Monica, Oh  let's not tell this story.
Phoebe, Oh no  I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
Rachel, What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
Joey, Hey  it's not like it sounds.
Chandler, It's exactly like it sounds.
Joey,  Hello?
Phoebe,  Hello?
Joey, Phoebe?
Phoebe, Joey? What's going on?
Joey, Look. 
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Joey, I know! It's stuck!!!
Phoebe,  Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey, I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey, Well then help me get it off! Plus  it smells really bad in here.
Phoebe, Well  of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Monica,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey  did you get the turkey basted—Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
Joey, It's Joey.
Monica, What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
Phoebe, No  it's not supposed to be funny  it's supposed to be scary.
Monica, Well  get it off now!
Joey, I can't! It-it's stuck!
Monica, Well  I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Phoebe, All right  hold on! Okay  let's just all think.
Monica, Okay  I got it. Phoebe? All right  you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.  Joey? Now is not the time!
Joey, Sorry! Sorry.
Monica, Okay  count to three. 1. 2. 3!
Chandler, Arghhhhhh!! 
Joey,  It worked! I scared ya  I knew it! Ha-ha!
Chandler, I'm over here big guy.
Joey,  Yeah  you are!  I scared you!
Chandler,  You did look like an idiot.
Joey," Hey  I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say  ""Butternut squash?"" And it came out  ""Squatternut buash?"""
Ross, Yeah that's the same.
Monica, That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
Phoebe, Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
Monica, Umm  I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Chandler, Oh  come on Monica  reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know  for me anyway. And of course  the Indians.
Monica, Look umm  of all people  you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica, I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!
Ross,  Hey!
Ross, Uh  everyone  this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
Ross, Oh  this is Monica.
Chandler,  Okay.
Ross, Oh  mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Chandler, Well  as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it  I'm in.
Ross, So uh  Rach? Does it  does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
Ross, Well  that's cool. So did… 
Ross, Umm  I'm sorry Judy  I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Ross,  Monica!
Chandler, Oh yeah  it was great. You should be a chef.
Ross, So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
Chandler, Emotional Knapsack?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Right on! Oh! Uh  but  don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh  we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight  right Clifford Alverez.
Ross, Listen  Roland Chang  if things go well  I’m gonna be out with her all night.
Chandler, Dude  don't do that too me!
Ross, All right  it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
Chandler, No  it's not that  I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Monica, Well  I do.
Chandler, I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
Phoebe, Oh  I can't believe you called her fat.
Ross, I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
Chandler, I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so  so sorry.
Rachel, Actually  y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Monica, Yes  it was!
Rachel, No  it wasn't. It was actually the…
Monica,  Okay  now Thanksgiving's over  let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
Phoebe, Oh  no  I have the cutest Christmas story!
Chandler, We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Phoebe, Fine  all right  mine had a dwarf that got broke in half  but y'know whatever.
Rachel, Oh  yeah  I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Rachel, Oh hi!
Rachel, No  God! Please  let me! 
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, Hey.  Happy Thanksgiving!
Chandler, Yeah  we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. 
Ross, So uh  where's Monica?
Monica, Hi  Chandler.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Monica, What-what's the matter? Is there  is there something on my dress? 
Chandler, You just  you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Ross, Dude!
Chandler, Sorry!
Ross, Oh mom! Okay  umm  her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh  she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
Monica, So Chandler  I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Chandler, Sorry.
Rachel,  Oh-ho  my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
Monica, Well it didn't!
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Yeah  I mean yeah  I look great. Yeah  I feel great and yeah  my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah  blah  blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back  y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna  I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
Rachel, Okay  that we may be able to do.
Monica, How?
Rachel, Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
Monica, What?! I mean  I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
Rachel, Okay  first of all  if you keep calling it that  no one's gonna ever take it. Then  second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
Rachel, Then  you will definitely get him back!
Monica, Okay  so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
Rachel, Okay  oh  here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
Monica, What do you mean?
Rachel, Well  like anything can be sexy. Like umm  oh-oh  like this dishtowel!  Ooh  ooh  this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot  I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
Monica,  I can do that!
Rachel, Yeah? Okay! Good  good  because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey  what's up? 
Chandler, Monica  I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Monica, Umm  I'd love too!  Ooh  I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Boy  I love carrots! Oh!  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.  Umm  and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm  I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm  I-I put the cold steal against umm   my body. 
Chandler, Are you all right?
Monica, Oh yeah  of course. I'm fine it's just that—
Ross, Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe  you just said it!
Monica, Oh yes! I have it right here  on ice! 
Monica, What?! What is it?
Chandler, What?
Rachel, You brought a carrot?!
Monica, God  I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
Chandler, Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Monica, Wait  no-no-no  I can go really fast! Dad  give me the keys to your Porsche!
Chandler, That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
Monica, I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
Chandler, That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
Monica, I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Chandler, Yeah  well  I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. 
Monica, Chandler! 
Ross,  Sir Limps-A-Lot  I came up with that.
Joey, You're a dork.
Chandler, I can't believe this.
Monica, Chandler  I said I was sorry.
Chandler, Yeah  well  sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Monica, Oh wait  Chandler  come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Chandler, Yeah  just leave me alone for a while. 
Chandler," Oh-oh  I'm a duck! I go  ""Quack  quack!"" I’m happy all the time!"
Chandler, Nice try.
Monica, Wait  wait  wait! 
Chandler, Look  Monica…
Monica, Look! 
Chandler, This is not going to work.
Monica, I bet this will work! 
Chandler, You are so great! I love you!
Monica, What?
Chandler," Nothing! I said  I said ""You're so great"" and then I just  I just stopped talking!"
Monica, You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler, No I didn't!
Monica, Yes  you did!
Chandler, No I didn't!
Monica, You love me!
Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Phoebe, What am I sitting on?
Chandler, Top of the world? Dock of the bay?  I'm out.
Phoebe,  Ew-eww!! Undies!
Rachel, All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
Ross, Well  they're not mine!
Chandler, Well  they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Joey, Yeah  they're mine.
Chandler, See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Ross, Why are they here?
Joey, I don't know uhh…  Well  I'm Joey. Yeah  I'm disgusting  I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Rachel, Well  get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?
Chandler, Yeah!
Monica, Yeah!
Rachel,  Take 'em!  Joey  you can touch them! They're your underwear.
Joey,  Chandler? A word.
Joey, That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!  Ahh!  And tighty-whiteys! What are you  8?
Monica,  Thank you Joey  thank you so much!
Joey, Oh hey  no  you're not welcome. Okay  look  I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me!  Yesterday  Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say  so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and 
Monica,  Wow! And around the ankles  y'know that is a tough spot.
Joey, Yeah  it was! All right  listen  I can't…
Chandler,  All this lying has been hard on us too.
Joey, Oh-oh  yeah-yeah  I bet all the sex makes it easier!
Chandler, Well  yeah actually.
Monica, We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that  we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well  and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Chandler, I know it sounds really weird  but we're just so bad at relationships.
Monica, We are! Help us!
Chandler, Help!
Joey, All right! But   you do it with me once.
Monica, Joey!
Joey, Didn't think so.
Monica, Hey  Phoebe!
Chandler, Hi  Pheebs!
Rachel, Hey  Pheebs!
Joey, Hey  Pheebs!
Rachel, What are you reading?
Phoebe, Umm  Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Chandler, I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Phoebe, Yeah! Well  I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something  y'know a little more intellectual  with a less painful final exam.
Rachel, Honey that sounds like fun.
Phoebe, Yeah! Ooh  you should come with me! Oh yeah  then I'd have someone to sit with!
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Yeah! Okay—ooh  but are you going to have time to read it?
Rachel, Oh  I read that in high school.
Phoebe, This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh  I have to finish.
Ross,  Hi.
Joey, What's wrong buddy?
Ross, Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Chandler, Well  what did the police say?
Ross, My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Chandler, Ross  it's just a sandwich!
Ross, Just a sandwich? Look  I am 30 years old  I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Monica, Okay  look  I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich  I mean I was going to eat it myself  but 
Ross,  That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean  look  I left a note and everything.
Chandler,  Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch  who? Ross Geller's lunch  please don't take me. Okay?
Joey, I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Phoebe, Okay  look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Ross," Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh  ""Keep your mitts off my grub?"""
Chandler, Say Ross  when you picture Phoebe living on the street  is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Phoebe, Okay  this will keep them away from your stuff. 
Monica, Phoebe  you are a bad ass!
Phoebe, Someday I'll  tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Monica, Phoebe?
Phoebe, Well  he stabbed me first!!
Rachel,  Sorry I'm late  but I left late.
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, So Pheebs  what is the book about?
Phoebe, I thought you said you read it in high school.
Rachel, Well yeah  but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was  I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm  what is this book about?
Phoebe, Okay  umm  it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm  it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Rachel, Umm  well I would have to say that it's a  it's tragic love story.
Rachel, Oh-oh-oh  symbolism! And uh  the-the uh  wildness of the mores  which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Phoebe,  You completely stole my answer!
Rachel, Well  honey that was pretty obvious.
Phoebe, Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Phoebe, I think that uh  yours is a question with many answers.
Phoebe, Would you care to venture one?
Phoebe, Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Phoebe, Okay then.
Phoebe, Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!
Rachel, Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean  that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Ross,  Phoebe!
Phoebe, Yeah?
Ross, Phoebe! You're note  amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich  but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah  a guy called me mental! Mental Geller  yeah  I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Monica, Yeah  the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Ross, That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway  people are writing reports for me  uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule  I'm telling you  you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani  give me that coffee! Now!
Joey, So you uh  still wondering?
Joey, You're smart. I like that.
Joey, Oh no-no-no-no  wait-wait-wait!!
Joey, Hiya.
Rachel, Joey  is what she just said umm—Oh my God.  You were actually gonna…  
Chandler, What is going on here?
Rachel, And with Chandler in the next room. What are you  what are you sick?
Joey, I'm Joey. I mean  I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films. 
Joey, You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean  come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
Monica, We're so sorry.
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Well  I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
Chandler, No-no  wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
Joey, Yeah  I like that. But no-no  how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
Chandler, Oh—I don't know.
Joey, Well  get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Monica, Okay  just wait  please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Joey, All right. Hey  but it better make me look really  really good.  Oh  and another thing  the video camera? Nice!!
Ross, Yeah  of course  Donald.
Ross, What?!
Ross,  Yeah.
Ross, Oh no  you-you don't understand. Ugh  this is so silly. Umm  this is all because of a sandwich.
Ross, Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is  she puts a  an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway  I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
Ross, What?
Ross, You ate my sandwich?
Ross,  Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
Ross, Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
Ross,  That said it was my sandwich?!
Ross,  What?
Ross, You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Ross,  MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! 
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, Hi!
Rachel,  So umm  what's this book about?
Phoebe, You didn't read this one either?!
Rachel, Well  I was gonna  but I accidentally read something else.
Phoebe, What?
Rachel, Vogue! Hey  so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.
Phoebe, No! You should've read it yourself!
Rachel, Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!
Phoebe, Fine! Okay  all right  so Jane Eyre  first of all  you'd think she's a woman  but she's not. She's a cyborg.
Rachel, A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!
Phoebe, Yeah  this book was light years ahead of its time.
Phoebe, Umm  Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
Rachel, Uh  thank you Phoebe. Umm  well  what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh  how the book was so ahead of its time.
Rachel, Yeah  well  feminism yes  but also the robots.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey. Okay  so umm  since that video camera thing didn't work out uh  I thought that I would give you just a little preview. 
Chandler,  You're naked in this picture!
Monica, I know.
Chandler, Ross?
Ross,  Hey Chandler.  Monica!
Monica, Ross  are you okay?
Ross, I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Monica, Why?!
Ross, On account of my rage.
Chandler, Which I may say  right now  is out of control.
Ross, He gave me a pill for it.
Monica, A pill?
Ross, Uh-huh. Well  when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again  so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so  I took it.
Monica, Wait a minute  they're making you take time off work?
Chandler, And you're okay with that?
Ross, I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while  but I  I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Rachel,  Ugh  that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!
Phoebe,  I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
Rachel, That was not funny!
Phoebe, Well  I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Rachel, Phoebe  come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know  I thought it would be fun!
Phoebe, Well  yeah! Fun is good  but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know  people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
Rachel, Ohh. Oh  so you really wanted to learn. Yeah  y'know  Pheebs I just wanted to have fun. Ohh  you know who you should go with?
Monica,  I know! I know! I know!
Rachel,  Oh my God! That's Monica!!
Joey, Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Rachel, You get away from me!! You sick  sick  sick  sick-o!!
Ross,  What's going on?
Rachel, Joey has got a secret peephole!
Chandler,  Oh no! No! No! No! 
Rachel, Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica! He takes naked pictures of us! And then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Rachel, Look! 
Ross,  Dude! That's my sister! 
Monica,  Give me that!
Phoebe, All right  wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Joey, No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…
Chandler, All right  look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Joey, Thank you!
Chandler, Joey's a sex addict.
Joey, What?!!  No I'm not!!
Monica, It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Joey, No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Monica, Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Joey, No it isn't! No  it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Rachel, Well  what is the truth?
Ross, Yeah  what's going on?
Phoebe, What's going on?
Joey,  I slept with Monica.
Chandler, Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Monica, Oh no!
Ross, You slept with my sister?
Joey, Uh yes  but it was  we just did it once uh  in London.
Ross, This is not good for my rage. 
Rachel, Monica  is this true?
Joey, Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Monica, Yes it's true.
Rachel, Okay  but if it only happened that one time  how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
Joey, Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Monica, I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.
Ross, My God Monica!!
Chandler, Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Joey, No! If anyone's a sex addict here  it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Phoebe, So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Joey, That makes sense!
Rachel, And the video camera?
Joey, Uhh  Monica?
Monica, I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
Joey, But sadly I could not be enticed.
Ross, Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
Monica, I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Joey, Well  I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right  now  I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin  so the chicken's up for grabs. 
Phoebe, I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know  until you got cut off.
Phoebe, I don't know! I didn't come with her!
Monica,  All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
Monica, Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
Joey, What are you doing?
Ross, I...reorganized the fridge. See  bottom shelf: meats and dairy.  Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables.  And top shelf: expired products. 
Joey, Why are you doing this?
Ross, Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank  post office  and the dry cleaners.
Joey, Dude  you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little  you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?
Ross, Hey  I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
Joey, Hey  don’t get religious on me  ok.  A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here…sit down.  Ready?  Ahh!!  Ohh  yeah!! Huh?!
Ross, So what  we just sit?
Joey, Ohh  no  no. We’re not going to just sit.  Shhh. 
Chandler,  Hello  Chandler Bing.
Joey,  Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
Chandler,  Alright  whoever this is  stop calling me!  It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
Joey, But  I love you.
Chandler, Leave me alone! For the love of God  leave me alone!!! 
Joey, And that’s Wednesday.  Ohh.
Phoebe, Hey you guys  guess what?
Chandler, The British are coming?
Phoebe, Ohh  you and your ways.  Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.
Phoebe,  Yeah  I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
Chandler, Ohh.
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah  I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean  last year  I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year  I’m going to do the whole city.
Monica, You know  I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular. 
Joey, So Pheebs  where are you doing all  your bell ringing?
Phoebe," Ohh  they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah  they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie  but I’m the only one who can sing ""Merry Christmas"" in 25 languages.  I lied."
Rachel, Oh my god. Ok you guys  there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.  See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh  he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.
Monica, Danny? You know Rachel? She’s nice. She’s not bad to look at  right?
Rachel, Thanks  Mon.
Monica, Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Rachel, Monica!!!
Monica, Friday’s perfect...She can’t wait.
Rachel,  Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don’t answer me.  I have a date with Danny.
Joey, How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Joey, She’s a woman!
Joey,  Okay  is there anything else?
Phoebe, Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo  and Merry Christmas.  Ohh thank you sir. Here's some joy. 
Monica,  Phoebe!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, I just wanted to see how it's going.
Phoebe, Well  it's going okay.
Monica,  Well good  here let me help you out.
Phoebe, Oh  thanks!
Monica, Yeah!
Phoebe, Wow!
Phoebe, Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Monica, Yeah. I guess. 
Phoebe, Just get your nails done?
Monica, Yes Phoebe  but this is all I have. Okay? 
Phoebe, Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays  here's your joy. 
Phoebe, Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
Phoebe, Wait  you can't take the money out.
Phoebe, But  can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
Phoebe, Okay  Seasons Greetings and everything  but still…
Phoebe, Oh  I'm going to give him something else besides joy  just… 
Joey, That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
Ross, I'm sorry  man. Hey  y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know  like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean  what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Joey, Come on Ross be realistic  y'know? If I did write something  what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Joey, Wait a second  I could star in it!
Ross, Or that.
Joey, I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor  I don't have the discipline that takes  y'know? I can't do it.
Ross, I'll help you. Yeah  I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus  it'll give me something to do.
Joey, Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, Thanks!
Ross,  All right  we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Joey, Done!
Ross, And it can't be Joey.
Joey, It's not.
Ross, Or Joseph.
Joey,  Oh.
Monica, Hey  what's up?
Rachel, I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Monica, Oh  honey  I'm sorry.
Rachel, Well  you should be  this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
Monica, You had no relationship!!
Rachel, No  but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Monica, Oh God  stop with the plan! So what  so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look  you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
Rachel, She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right  I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Monica, Come on  hurry!
Joey, Hey  how do you spell suspicious?
Chandler, Why?
Joey, Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Chandler, Yes! Chandler Bing  7! Chandler Bing  0.
Joey, You're driving me crazy with that!
Chandler, Okay  I'll stop.
Joey, Don’t stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Joey, Well  you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
Chandler, You wanna play?
Joey, Chandler  I can't be playing games  Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Chandler, Well  so  play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
Joey,  All right! But uh  listen  what do you say we crank it up a notch?
Chandler, I'm intrigued.
Joey, All right  all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Chandler, Okay  but be careful okay  because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Joey, Yeah  I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Chandler, Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Joey, Uh yeah  right here. 
Phoebe, Thank you  Happy Holidays.
Phoebe, Now  that's trash. Young lady  you can't…  Hey! Stop that young lady  she donated trash!
Phoebe, Hey!!  The charity's on fire! Help!  Oh good! Thank you  I need that.  Whoa! What is that?!   It's nine o'clock in the morning!
Ross, All right.  A room. A man enters  he looks suspicious.  That's it?  Joey  you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident!  And what is  and what is all this?!  The official rulebook of Fireball.
Joey, Yeah  that's the uh  game we were playing.
Chandler,  Oh yeah  it's great! See you take a tennis ball  a bowl  and some lighter fluid—Op! Op! 
Ross, This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
Joey, You're right  you're right  I'll get back to work.
Ross,  And shame on you! You should know better  Joey needs to work.  Now come on!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done!  Ahh! 
Rachel, So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
Rachel, You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel,  Uh  it was very nice meeting you. 
Phoebe, Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look!  Okay  does this look like a garbage can to you?
Monica, No.
Phoebe, Does it look like an ashtray?
Monica, No.
Phoebe, Does it look like a urinal?
Monica, Eww!! 
Ross, So Pheebs  are you gonna go back out there or what?
Phoebe, Well  yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
Monica, Yeah  good for you. Y'know you're tough  you lived on the streets.
Phoebe, Yeah  I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but  y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry. 
Rachel,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  umm  can I ask you guys something?
Rachel, Uh  I don't have any brothers so I don't know  but uh  did you guys wrestle?
Ross, Oh-oh  yeah.
Monica, All the time. In fact  I was undefeated.
Ross, Uh  you weighted 200 pounds.
Monica, Still  I was quick as a cat.
Rachel, Well  I met Danny's sister yesterday  and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
Monica, Oh  you're kidding.
Rachel, Yeah  they were very y'know…wrestley. But  I guess that's normal?
Monica,  We don't  we don't wrestle now.
Ross, Yeah  not since I got too strong for you.
Monica, Too strong for me?
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now  buddy! You wanna go?
Ross, Oh fine.
Monica, Ready?  Wrestle! 
Rachel, Okay  y'know what uh  actually  that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. 
Chandler,  Guys  come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on  Joe!
Ross, Joey's not going.
Joey,  I didn't finish my five pages.
Chandler, Well  why can't you do them tomorrow?
Ross, Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Joey, Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Chandler,  Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit  he'll get some work done.
Ross, I think he's been relaxing enough  thanks to you and Fireball.
Joey, Dude  if you think Fireball's relaxing  you've obviously have never played.
Chandler, The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay  it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
Ross, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Joey, Come on look guys  don't fight.
Ross, And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend  you'd be doing the same thing.
Chandler, Oh  so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
Ross, If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Joey, Hey-hey guys  hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
Ross, How about we settle this right now!  There! Now  no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
Chandler, I paid for those tickets!
Ross, No you didn't. You said you would  but you never did!
Chandler, Oh yeah! 
Joey, Oh  y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Chandler, When did that happen to you?!
Joey, Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera!
Chandler, Oh yeah. First off all  chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Rachel, Oh  great!
Chandler, Okay  bye!  Oh my God!!
Monica, That was unbelievable!
Rachel, Okay  see? I told you!
Joey, Yeah  wow  sorry Rach.
Chandler, I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Joey, They're brother and sister!!!
Phoebe, Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute  open up your hand; let me take a look.  Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that.  What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here! 
Phoebe, Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!  And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!  Hi Bob!   I thought I told you to get outta here!
Phoebe, What?!
Phoebe, That chick can't handle my corner.
Phoebe, Fine.   All right  I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch. 
Rachel, Yeah uh  y'know what uh  let's skip it.
Rachel, Umm  you-you and your sister seem to have umm  a very special bond  and…
Rachel, Well  okay  look. I don't know  listen  I don't know what's going on here but let's…
Rachel, No  I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Rachel, No-no  they're not very nice people.
Rachel, Well  uh  I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…
Rachel, Yeah  okay  I'll see you later. 
Chandler, Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street  you wanna go down there and give them a project  ruin their day?
Ross, Hey  if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game  Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Joey,  Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
Ross, Yay!
Chandler, Great! Now  we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!
Joey, No dude  Ross tore up the tickets!
Ross, I guess when you don't have so many distractions  it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
Chandler, Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Joey, Yeah  well  that's fine  but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh  I think it's really good  but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
Chandler, All right. 
Ross, All right. 
Joey," Okay.  ""It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."" Ross "
Ross, Hey man.
Chandler, What is up?
Ross, About yesterday  I was really wrong. I am sorry.
Chandler, No  it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Ross, Maybe it was both of us  but we had our best friend's interest…  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Chandler, Could I be more sorry. 
Ross, I don't know  I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey  we get it.  I'm sorry.
Chandler,  I'm sorry too.
Joey, Oh no! No-no  keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
Ross,  I am sorry  Chandler.
Chandler, I am sorry  Ross.
Joey, A handsome man enters.  Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about  but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You   you wouldn't let me give up on myself  and you  well you co-created Fireball. The end.
Chandler, This took you all day?!
Joey, No-no  this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new  Ultimate Fireball.  Ha-ha!
Joey,  Okay  it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
Monica, Hi  how are you doing Kelly?
Rachel, I'm doing just fine! God  Tiffany  you smell so great!
Monica, It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
Rachel, Oh  y'know Joey  you are sick!
Monica, This is disgusting!
Rachel, I'm not reading this!
Joey, What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
Joey, All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Chandler,  We're very happy for you.
Joey, What's the matter?!
Chandler, We wanted to kiss at midnight  but nobody else is going to so y'know…
Joey, All right  I'll take care of it.
Monica, Oh no  wait! Joey!
Ross,  73! 72! 71!
Joey, Ross! Ross! Ross  listen! Who are you kissing at midnight  huh? Rachel or Phoebe?
Ross, What?
Joey, Well you gotta kiss someone  you can't kiss your sister.
Ross, Well  who's gonna kiss my sister.
Joey, Chandler.
Ross, Awww  man! Really?
Joey, Dude-dude  who would you rather have kiss your sister  me or Chandler?
Ross, That's a good point.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Oh well  since I have that whole history with Rachel  I guess Phoebe.
Joey, Okay  great!
Ross, All right.
Joey, Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
Phoebe, It's so obvious  why doesn't he just ask?
Joey, Rach! Rach! Listen  I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Well  everyone's gotta kiss someone. You can't kiss Ross you got the history.
Rachel, So?
Joey, So? Who would you rather have kiss you  me or Chandler?
Rachel, Oh  good point.
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler,  Happy New Year!
Monica, Happy New Year.
Ross,  Happy New Year  Pheebs!
Phoebe, You too!
Rachel,  Happy New Year  Joey!
Joey, So did that do anything for ya?
Ross, Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!
Rachel, But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Ross, Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what  I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.
Chandler, Do you want us to leave the room  or?
Ross, Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.
Phoebe, Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Chandler, That's good one too  Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Phoebe, Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends  especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Monica, She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
Ross, In fact  I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh  y'know what  better yet? A week.
Chandler," I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what  paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day!""  And it starts right now!"
Joey, All right  my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ross, Ohh.
Phoebe, Really?! How come?
Joey, Well  y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Phoebe, Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Joey, Really? Who-who have you taught?
Phoebe, Well  I taught me and I love me.
Joey, Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Rachel, Op  look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend  who  I hear  needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer  if you know what I'm talking about.
Monica, Hey Rach  maybe your resolution should be to umm  gossip less.
Rachel, I don't gossip!
Rachel, Well  maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service  it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean  would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Monica, Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs  I would.
Rachel, What? They were like this!
Ross, Okay!   Hey!
Ross, I just asked that girl out.
Chandler, Nice!
Joey, Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution  your new thing for today?
Ross, Yes it is. See. 
Chandler,  Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
Ross, That's right  uh  Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Chandler, Horn-swoggle.
Joey, You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
Chandler, No. No  I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. 
Joey, Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! 
Ross, Hi  Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Oh-oh  guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.
Phoebe, Hornswoggle?  Ooh  this must be killing you.
Ross, All right  see you later.
Joey, See ya! All right Pheebs  I am ready for my first lesson.
Phoebe, Okay.  Oh no-no-no  you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here   then you learn here. 
Joey, Umm  okay.
Phoebe, Okay  lesson one: chords. Now  I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm  I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.   So then  this is Bear Claw. Okay  umm  Turkey Leg and Old Lady. 
Chandler, What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing  I myself find it regular.
Phoebe, Hey everybody  Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
Rachel, I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm  all right  well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it. 
Joey, Hey  Pheebs! Check-check this out. 
Phoebe, Ooh  you nailed the Old Lady! 
Joey, Yeah listen so  I thought I was getting better  so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…
Phoebe, Did you  did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Joey, Yes!
Phoebe, Then don't touch one!!
Ross,  Hi!
Monica, Hi Ben!
Chandler,  Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants!
Rachel, I think they're very nice.
Monica, I like 'em.
Joey, Yeah! 
Monica, I like them a lot.
Chandler, That's not what I had in mind! See  people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see  they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.
Ross," Oh see  I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself  ""Wow   I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."""
Chandler, Oh come on!! 
Ross,  Okay  seriously  what do you think?
Joey, You look like a freak.
Rachel, Awful  absolutely awful. 
Ross, What are you  what are you doing?
Monica, It's my New Year's resolution!
Ross, What  to blind my child?
Monica, No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Joey, Well  everyone will enjoy my music as well. 
Ross,  My God! These pants are burning up!   Oh come on  she wants to snuggle now! What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here!  Are you hot?
Ross, Okay  it must just be me then.
Ross, That was just the pants on the couch. Umm  hey  do you  do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Ross, Thanks. 
Ross,  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….
Ross, 'Kay!
Ross, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Tiger!  Dragon! Iceberg!!  Joseph  did you even study at all last night?
Joey, Yes! Yes  I did.
Phoebe, Then do Iceberg!
Joey,   G-sharp.
Phoebe, G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?  Have you?  Oh my God!
Joey, What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
Phoebe, No  but you're questioning my method!
Joey, No  I'm not questioning it  I'm saying it's stupid!  What?! 
Monica, Thank you. 
Phoebe, Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Joey, Your other student  was you!
Phoebe, Yeah  well  y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Joey,  Look  maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper  he teaches guitar and look ooh  there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!! 
Phoebe, Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad  Bad Leroy Brown!!
Rachel,"  ""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""
Phoebe, Oh  fine! Take his side! 
Monica,  I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler,  Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
Monica,  Awww  y'know what your nickname is  Mr. Big…
Rachel, Arghh!! 
Joey,  Hello?
Ross,  Joey  it's Ross! I need some help!
Joey, Uhh  Chandler's not here.
Ross, Well  you can help me!
Joey, Okay.
Ross, Listen  I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
Joey, Nice!
Ross, No  I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look  I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Joey, Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh  do you see any like  powder?
Ross, Powder! Yeah! Yeah  I have powder! 
Joey, Good-good  okay  sprinkle some of that on your legs  it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.
Ross, Yeah  okay  hold on!   They're not coming on man.
Joey, Umm  do you see any—oh  Vaseline?
Ross, Ohh  I-I see lotion  I have lotion! Will that work?
Joey, Yeah  sure  spread some of that on there.
Ross, Hold on.
Joey, Ross? You okay?
Ross, They're still  they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Joey, Really?! Uhh  what color is it?
Ross, What difference does that make?!
Joey, Well  I'm just—if the paste matches the pants  you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Rachel,  Joey  do you have a minute?
Ross, Dude  what am I gonna…
Joey,  Uh  Rachel's here  so good luck man  let me know how it works out. 
Rachel, Oh  Joey  I have such a problem!
Joey, Oh well  you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Rachel, Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey  I have got to tell you something!
Joey, What-what is it  what is it?
Rachel, Oh my God  it's so huge  but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Joey, Oh no  no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Rachel, Yes! Yes! Yes  you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
Joey, I don't care  Rach! Look  I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
Rachel, What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
Joey, And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
Rachel, I know  I know! I just can't keep this one in  so I pick up the phone… 
Joey, I'm not listening to you!
Ross, All right  I'm coming out. Hey  can you turn the lights off.
Ross, I had a problem.
Joey, Hey  Pheebs?
Phoebe, No  I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Joey, Look  Pheebs  I just  I wanna apologize for  for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise  I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.  You really think I'm ready?
Phoebe, Uh-huh!
Joey, Wow! Cool! 
Joey,  Was the chord at least right…
Phoebe, No!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Monica, We heard about your pants  I'm so sorry.
Ross, This year was supposed to be great! But  it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Ross, Look at me! 
Monica, Hey  hey  look. Look Ross  Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Ross, Oh  be-because of the leather pants.
Monica, See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser  he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, That really is something; that's really cool.
Joey, Howdy partner!
Ross, Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh  y'know  they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.  I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.  I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.  I would make a good cowboy. 
Monica, Okay  now that everything's wrapped up here  I think I'm  I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Chandler, Oh yeah  me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.
Phoebe, Okay  I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough  someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Rachel, Good luck  honey!
Phoebe, Bye! 
Rachel, Hey  uh  Joey?
Joey, Umm?
Rachel, Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?
Joey, Oh  no! 
Rachel, I'm not gonna tell you  but if you found out on your own  that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?
Joey, Well  then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah  that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!
Rachel,  Yeah. Well.  Hey uh Joe  would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?
Joey, Now? You want me to go over there now?
Rachel, Yeah!
Joey, Do you know something?
Rachel, Do you know something?
Joey, I might know something.
Rachel, I might know something too.
Joey, What's the thing you know?
Rachel, Oh no  I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.
Joey, I can't tell you what I know.
Rachel, Well then I can't tell you what I know.
Joey, Okay  fine.
Joey, You don't know!
Rachel, All right  how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! 
Joey,  YOU KNOW!!!!
Rachel, AND YOU KNOW!!!
Joey, Yeah  I know!!!!
Rachel, Chandler and Monica?!! Oh  this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?
Joey, Too long! Oh my God  Rach  I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen  listen  we can't say anything about this to anybody  they're so weird about that! Listen… 
Phoebe, Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So…
Joey, Oh  I am going to go for a walk in the rain.
Rachel, Ohhh  yeah  me too.
Phoebe, That's weird.  I bet they're doing it.
Chandler,  Oh good  okay  I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win  okay? Here!  Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross  phone call for you today  Tom Jones  he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What are you dating a character from Fraggile Rock?! 
Rachel, Come on Joey!!!
Joey, Rach  I told you everything I knew last night! Look  it's not that big of a deal  so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
Rachel, I can't believe you would say that!
Joey, Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
Rachel, No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal!  Fine I want—I need more details  who-who initiated the first kiss?
Joey,  I don't know.
Rachel, Is he romantic with her?
Joey, I don't know.
Rachel, Are they in love?
Joey,  I don't know.
Rachel, You don't know anything.
Joey, Ohh  I know one thing!
Rachel, What?
Joey, They did it right there on the couch.
Joey, Hey Ross!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross,  Hey-yeah.  Hey Gunther  can I have a scone please?  Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are happy occasions! Oh  by-the-by it's my ex-wife Emily!
Chandler, Sorry man.
Ross, Oh  thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Chandler, Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Phoebe, Hey  you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way  you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Rachel, Pheebs  I don’t think anyone's mad about that.
Phoebe, Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Joey,  Anybody gonna eat that?
Monica, Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way  what are we celebrating?
Chandler, Oh  we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
Monica, I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
Chandler, I know  I can do this. 
Monica, Ooh  and I can do this. 
Chandler, I asked myself that very question  sir. Uh   this is Monica.  This is my boss  Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Monica, Hi  nice to meet you!
Chandler, No  sir.
Monica, What was that?
Chandler, What?
Monica, That noise you just made?
Chandler, Oh  that was my work laugh.
Monica, Really? Your work laugh?
Chandler, Oh  believe me  to survive this party  you're gonna have to come up with one too.
Monica, All right  check me out.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Monica, Really?
Chandler, And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway  I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.
Monica, Hey  I thought you already had one.
Chandler, Oh I used too  but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks.  Hey Rach  do you have a tennis racquet?
Rachel, Oh umm  y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Chandler, Okay  good luck with that. 
Rachel,  Hey!
Monica, Hi!
Rachel, What's up?!
Monica, What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Rachel, Well yeah  I do  but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Monica, Uhh  not much. Uh  work's good.
Rachel, Oh y'know what  we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Monica, Okay. Umm…
Rachel, Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Monica, Okay  what's going on with you?
Rachel, Nothing! You go!
Monica, Well  I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm  but I don't anymore.
Rachel, Wow that's uh  juicy. Umm   y'know what though Mon  I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?
Monica, Yes  I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Rachel, No!   If there was I wouldn't tell you.
Phoebe, Okay  then what happened?
Phoebe,  Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
Ross,  Hey Pheebs  what's going on?
Phoebe, Nothing!   This is not over!
Ross, No! No! No!
Phoebe, What?!
Ross, I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually  thanks!
Joey,  All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Ross, Uh actually  I think I'm gonna skip it.
Joey, Really?
Ross, Yeah  I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Joey, Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks  Meg Ryan  they get mail and stuff.
Ross, That's okay  Joe.
Joey, All right  let's go Pheebs.
Ross,  Oh God!
Monica, Game!
Monica, Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned  basted  and ready to be carved!
Chandler, Okay  easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
Monica, I'm sorry  I don't understand what you just said.
Chandler, Let them win one.
Monica, Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um  he can't breath and she's popping pills.
Chandler, You're not even giving them a chance!
Monica, They have racquets don't they?!
Chandler, Oh yes  sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win!
Monica, I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.
Chandler, Oopsey  missed it!
Monica, I got it! 
Monica, I got it!!
Chandler, Long! 
Monica, I can't believe you let them win!
Chandler, Yeah  at least you hid your feelings well about it. 
Monica, I was frustrated.
Chandler, It was my racquet.
Monica, I was frustrated with you!
Chandler, If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Monica," Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games  the fake laugh  the ""I'll see you around  Bing!"" ""Not if I see you first  Doug!""  I gotta tell you  I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up."
Chandler, Okay y'know what  because you said that  I'm not putting out tonight.
Monica, I'm telling you  something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.
Joey, Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Rachel, Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
Joey, That's right  he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, There he is!
Monica, Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!
Ross, Just  y'know out.
Rachel, Ohh  out  oh God  I don't know why we didn't think to check there!
Phoebe, What were you doing?
Ross, I uh  went to a bar. And then I just uh  just walked around for a while.
Rachel, You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
Joey,  He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
Ross, Look  I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy  I can do whatever I want!
Joey, He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Rachel, Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
Phoebe, Oh  nobody's judging you. 
Ross, Okay  look  I-I know what you guys are going to say…
Phoebe, You two will have very hairy children.
Ross, Okay  I didn't know you would say that.
Rachel, Ross! Janice?!
Joey, All right  hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross  okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Ross, Look  I didn't lose my mind! Okay  Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Phoebe, So are you actually gonna see her again?
Joey, Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Ross, I am gonna see her again.
Joey, Damnit Phoebe!!
Rachel,  Okay  I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But  when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow  that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay  you go!
Monica, My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Rachel, Ugh  Monica  I know about you and Chandler.
Monica, What?!
Rachel," I overheard you guys on the phone the other day  and you said  ""I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."" And he said  ""Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"" And you said  ""No! You know what your nickname is  Mr. Big."""
Monica, Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Rachel, Well  I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.
Monica, Well  if you had kept listening  you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot.
Rachel, What?!
Monica, Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
Rachel, All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.
Monica, Me and Chandler?! 
Joey, All right  put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Joey, All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.  And they're off! 
Phoebe, Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Joey, Judge rules  no violation.
Phoebe, Ohhh.
Ross,  Hey guys!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but  I just had a great day with Janice!
Joey, What?!
Phoebe, Are you serious?!
Ross, Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
Phoebe, You don't need Janice for that  you've got us. We…
Joey, And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Phoebe,  No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter  that's just an old Wonton!
Joey, Judge rules  Nutter-Butter.
Phoebe, Ohh  tough call.
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, Oh  none for me. Thanks.
Chandler, Just a little bit of sugar.
Monica,  How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Chandler, Oh  you get used to it.
Monica, Y'know  I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind  maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Chandler, So I laugh at my boss's jokes  what's the big deal?
Monica, I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Chandler, Oh. 
Chandler, What?
Chandler, Well  I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Chandler, Well  I just…
Monica,  Honey  I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, Yeah! I mean it was really funny  I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting  okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Chandler, I think I do!  Thank you  Monica.
Monica, I thought you could use the help.
Chandler, Coffee in a fight! 
Joey,  Hey Rach! Hey  you mind if I read my comic books in here?
Rachel, Sure! Why?
Joey, Oh well  Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.
Rachel, What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
Chandler,  All right  so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Monica, Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
Chandler, But we're not ready to tell yet!
Monica, I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Monica,  Joey?! Oh my God  Rachel!
Rachel, Hey! Hi!
Monica, Wh-wh-what are you doing here? 
Rachel, Well  I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm  look at my books  y'know  see them a little better.
Monica, Okay great!
Rachel, Yeah!
Monica, Great! Umm  well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm  I was cleaning it! In fact  he pays me to clean it!
Rachel, Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
Monica, Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm  I'm at my new work.
Rachel, That's good enough. Right?  Okay  well umm  I'm gonna go look at my books!
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, I'll get back to my new job.
Rachel, 'Kay.  Congratulations on your new job. 
Chandler, Man  she is really gullible.
Ross, Thanks!
Ross, Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work  right?
Ross, Oh…
Ross, This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
Ross, Okay. Sometimes I feel…
Ross, Huh?
Ross, Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right  you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?  So you're saying  I've become so whiney that I annoy you  Janice.
Ross, OH…MY…GOD!!
Ross, I am now.
Joey, Umm  hi.
Ross, Dude  we got to talk.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird  but uh  I had uh  a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?
Chandler, Why would I be mad?
Ross, Well  because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh  you don't fool around with your uh  friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
Chandler,  I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said  all on the list there. Well  but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Ross, Okay.
Chandler, I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
Ross, All right.
Chandler, And  I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now  if you can't remember that  I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
Monica, I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
Chandler, Oh! Look at that  time's up! My turn!
Monica, That was a half an hour?
Chandler, It's your timer.
Monica, Y'know  I don't like to brag about it  but I give the best massages!
Chandler, All right  then massage me up right nice!
Chandler, Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
Monica, It's so good  isn't it?
Chandler, It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Monica, Say good-bye to sore muscles!
Chandler, Good-bye muscles!!
Chandler, I'm telling you  she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay  it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!
Joey, Chandler  if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Chandler, Look  for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay  I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know  telling the truth.
Ross,  Hey.
Joey, Whoa  dude  look out! You almost crushed my hat! 
Ross, Sorry.
Chandler,  And the bunny got away. 
Ross,  This would be the place where you explain the hat.
Joey, Oh! Yeah  look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know  ultra-hip  high fashion stuff.
Chandler, And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Joey, Yeah  like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Chandler, Done.
Rachel, Joey  if you wanna look good  why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Joey, Great! Thanks  Rach!
Rachel, Sure!  God  please take those off!
Joey, All right.
Ross, Hey Pheebs  how's it going?
Chandler, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey! Umm  well  only okay because I just got back from  from the hospital.
Rachel, What?
Ross, Is everything okay?
Joey, Are you all right?
Phoebe, Oh yeah  no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay  but umm  my Grandma sorta died.
Joey, Pheebs! Sorry!
Phoebe, It's okay  I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again  y'know she's gonna visit.
Rachel, Well maybe  maybe she's with us right now?
Phoebe, Yeah  her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Monica,  Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Ross, Uhh  Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Monica, Ohh my God  I'm so sorry.
Phoebe, It's okay. Actually y'know what  it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know  one life ends and another begins.
Monica,  Not the way they're doing it. What  what happened? How did she die?
Phoebe, Well umm  okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Joey, Pheebs  I'm so sorry.
Phoebe," It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear  you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter."" And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter."
Rachel, Okay now Joey  y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
Joey, All right  then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Rachel, Okay  it's missing something. Ooh  I know! Umm  okay. 
Joey, Really? A purse?
Rachel, It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
Joey, It looks like a women's purse.
Rachel, No Joey  look. Trust me  all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look  men  carrying the bag.
Joey, See look  women  carrying the bag.  But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me  a man.
Rachel, Exactly! Unisex!
Joey, Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
Rachel, No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
Joey, Well  I ain't gonna say no to that.
Phoebe, It's Phoebe.
Phoebe, Umm  well I sorta have some bad news  can I come in?
Phoebe, Umm  well  umm Grandma died.
Phoebe, No  she just died today! Okay  umm  we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Phoebe, No you didn't!
Phoebe, Well  lots of people! Look  are you coming to memorial service or not?
Phoebe, Fine. Okay  enjoy your concert. 
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Chandler, Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Joey, What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first  I thought it just looked good  but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross, Your make-up!
Rachel,  Joey  what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Joey, Yeah  but sandwich time is right now. 
Rachel, Joey  y'know you get any mustard on that bag  you can't return it.
Joey, Why would I return it? I love this bag!
Rachel, All right  then you owe me $350.
Joey, Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard? 
Rachel,  Joey…
Joey, All right relax  look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
Ross, What's the part  Anti-man?
Rachel, Hey  don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
Joey, U-N-I-sexy? 
Phoebe, Well hello  Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well  okay look  here's your umm  3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Rachel, Hi sweetie!
Ross, Hey  how are you holding up?
Joey, Hey Pheebs  I'm so sorry.
Phoebe,  Hey  y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
Joey, Here  I brought you some flowers. 
Phoebe, Thanks!
Chandler, Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Phoebe, Yeah  welcome.
Phoebe, Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
Phoebe, So how did you know Francis?
Phoebe, Really?! What's your name?
Phoebe, You're Frank Buffay?
Phoebe, You just said…
Phoebe, But…
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Monica, What?! What honey?
Ross, What happened?
Phoebe, That was my dad!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Joey,  Hey you guys  check it out. Check it out.  It's like it's coming right at me. 
Monica, Oh  did you catch him?!
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Ross, Wh-what did he say?!
Phoebe," He said  ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well  obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
Rachel, Why?! Why not?!
Phoebe, Come on  you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
Joey, What did you say to him?
Phoebe, Well  I said  I told him y'know  that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Phoebe, All right  well  I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, All right  let's go say good-bye.
Joey,  Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
Rachel, Ahhh  I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Chandler, And a date with a man!
Joey, Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now  just because you don't understand something  doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey   comes with a bag! 
Phoebe, All right  I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Rachel, Ooh  Pheebs  what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Phoebe, Umm  no  not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
Ross," Well  but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me  this guy would be in some serious physical danger!  I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like  ""Yo  dad! You and me outside right now!""  I kinda scared myself."
Monica, Well  at least you scared someone.
Phoebe, Y'know it's funny  you'd think I'd be angry. I mean  you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately  I'm past it.
Monica, Phoebe  you do seem a little tense. Here  let me help you.
Phoebe, All right.
Phoebe, Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh  stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
Monica, What are you talking about?
Phoebe, As a masseuse and a human  I'm begging you  never do that to anyone!
Monica,  I give good massages!  I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch! 
Phoebe,  He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
Monica, No he's not!
Chandler,  Yes  he is!
Monica, What?!
Chandler, I'm sorry but  ow-owww-owww!
Monica, You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
Ross, Well  maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Monica, But the minute we start to lie to each other…  And by 'we' I mean society.
Joey,  Well  you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
Joey, Yeah  sure.  Well  you must be new here. Maybe we should—I'm sorry  can I ask you something? 
Joey, Well  first it's not a purse.
Joey, I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag  it's not. It's a man's bag!
Joey, All right look  let me show you the catalog!  See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Joey, Noooo. No-no-no  these babies sell themselves.
Joey, Yeah but I didn’t read anything.
Joey, Okay! All right  I'll see ya.   We got it! We got it!
Chandler, Hey  is Rachel here?
Monica, No.
Chandler,  Listen  I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Monica," Oh  please  stop! Look  we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say  ""I don't like your massages."""
Chandler,  I don't like your massages.
Monica,  See? It's no big deal.
Chandler, Okay  but now see you're crying!
Monica, I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
Chandler, What?
Monica,  My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
Chandler, It's okay  you don't have to be the best at everything.
Monica, Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Chandler, Okay  you give the worst massages in the world.
Monica, I'm crying here!!
Chandler," Okay  hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves  ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you."
Monica, Huh. So you're saying like umm  if there was an award for the best bad massage  well who would get that?
Chandler, Oh  it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
Monica, So maybe they could umm  call the award the Monica?
Chandler, Absolutely!
Monica, Okay. I suck!
Chandler, Yeah! 
Phoebe, Umm  thank you for meeting with me.
Phoebe, Come  sit.  Sit.  Sit!  Umm  all righty  before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, Huh?
Phoebe, Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm   this lipstick.
Phoebe, Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms.  Okay  so  question 1) You and uh  you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly  is that correct?
Phoebe, Okay  umm  question 2) Umm  did that marriage end A. Happily  B. Medium  or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
Phoebe, Yeah. See? 
Phoebe, Hmm  okay  total abandonment. Okay  reasons for abandonment  A. Top secret government work  B. Amnesia  or C. Or you're just a selfish  irresponsible bad  bad man?
Phoebe, What?!
Phoebe, But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
Phoebe, Lilly's dead. 
Phoebe, She's dead.
Phoebe, Well  if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
Phoebe, 17 years ago.
Phoebe, Well  Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe   is on this couch.
Phoebe, Yep  lipstick and a daughter  big day for you!
Phoebe, Yes. Well  that's neither here nor there.
Phoebe, Y'know what  it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway  so you can just go.
Phoebe, That's a defense?
Phoebe, You make up songs?
Phoebe, Well  I am. 
Phoebe, Not yet  no. 
Joey,  Hi.
Chandler, Hey man  how did the audition go?
Joey, Estelle said I didn't get it. 
Rachel, What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Joey, Yeah  I thought so too but  she said the casting people had some problems with me.
Ross, What kind of problem?
Joey, Well to tell you the truth  they uh   they had a problem with the bag!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Ross, Nooooo!
Joey, Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
Monica, Y'know  Joey  I think it's time to give up the bag.
Joey, I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh  you think I should give up the bag!
Rachel, Honey wait  Joey  I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it… 
Chandler, Oh  hey! 
Rachel, …I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
Joey, I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Rachel, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag  I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm   controversial.
Chandler, Yeah umm  they're called wallets.
Phoebe,  Oh hey  you guys  look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!
Rachel, I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Ross, Ironically  most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.
Rachel, Ohh  I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.
Chandler, And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Ross, Hey! Hey! If he's moving  maybe I should try to get his place!
Ross, It would be so cool to live across from you guys!
Joey, Hey  yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know  you have a can  we have a can and it's connected by a string!
Chandler, Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
Ross, Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Rachel, Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
Phoebe, It's amazing! You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.
Ross,  Ohh. 
Rachel, Well  I never thought I'd say this  but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom. 
Phoebe,  Oh  look! There's Monica and Chandler!  Hey! Hey  you guys! Hey!  Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe,  Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel, Oh my God!
Phoebe, CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe, OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel, Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe, NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Rachel, I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe, YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel, Yes  I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Ross,  What's going on?
Rachel,  HI!! Hi!
Ross, What?! What?!
Rachel, Nothing! Oh God  we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Ross, Actually  it looks really good. 
Phoebe,  Get in here!!! 
Phoebe, You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Rachel, Uh-huh  doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Phoebe, Oh! Oh  I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.
Joey,  Hey guys!
Rachel, Joey! Come here! Come here!
Joey, What? What?
Rachel, Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
Joey, You mean how they're friends and nothing more? 
Rachel, No. Joey  she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  Actually  we saw them doing it up against the window.
Phoebe, Okay  so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Joey, Yes  but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now  enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Phoebe, Or  we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Rachel, Wh-what do you mean?
Phoebe, Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.
Rachel, Ohhh  I-I would enjoy that!
Joey, No-no-no! No-no wait Rach  you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Rachel, Ehhh  no  I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Joey, I can't take any…
Phoebe, No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!
Joey, Noo! I can't take any more secrets!  I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Rachel, You don't have any secrets!
Joey, Oh yeah? Well  you don't know about Hugsy  my bedtime penguin pal. 
Rachel,  So umm  how-how are we gonna mess with them?
Joey, Ugh.
Phoebe, Well  you could use your position y'know as the roommate.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.
Chandler,  Hello children!
Phoebe, Okay  watch  learn  and don't eat my cookie.
Chandler, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey! Ooh  wow that jacket looks great on you!
Chandler, Really?
Phoebe,  Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?
Chandler, Well  I try to y'know  squeeze things.  Are you okay?
Phoebe, Well  if you really wanna know  I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.
Chandler, Phoebe  it's me. You can tell me anything.
Phoebe, Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.
Chandler, What's going on?
Phoebe, I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no  have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.
Monica, You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Chandler, Well  my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Monica, Okay  now you're even cuter!!
Chandler, Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
Monica, What?
Chandler, The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house  I think  I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
Monica, What are you talking about?
Chandler, I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
Monica, That's not possible!
Chandler, Ow!
Monica, I'm sorry it's just  Phoebe just always thought you were  you were charming in a  in a sexless kind of way.
Chandler, Oh  y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
Monica, I'm sorry  I think that you just misunderstood her.
Chandler, No  I didn't misunderstand  okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
Monica, This bicep?
Chandler, Well it's not flexed right now!
Rachel, Hey Mon  what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?
Monica, Uhh  y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Rachel, Oh.
Monica, Hey Chandler  wanna do it with me?
Chandler, Sure  I'll do it with ya.
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Okay great  hold on a sec!  Oh  here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!
Monica, I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Phoebe, I have quarters! 
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?
Ross, Well  I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, No-no  I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Monica, Oh  is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Ross, No.
Chandler, That new mountain bike?
Ross, No.
Monica, Well what did you send?
Ross, A basket of mini-muffins.
Phoebe, But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Ross, The small one.
Rachel, What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Ross, Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
Chandler, Your work makes me sad.
Ross, Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! 
Rachel, All right honey  we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica, Bye!
Phoebe, Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. 
Chandler,  Okay  did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Monica, Actually  I did!
Chandler, Okay  so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica, Ohhh  oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler, Are you serious?
Monica, Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
Chandler,  Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
Chandler,  Joey!
Joey, Yeah?
Chandler, Phoebe knows about us!
Joey, Well I didn't tell them!
Monica, Them?! Who's them?
Joey, Uhhh  Phoebe and Joey.
Monica, Joey!
Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler, Oh man!
Joey, I'm sorry! But hey  it's over now  right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Monica, Unless…
Joey, No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Monica, Oh man  they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…
Chandler, Ahh yes  the messers become the messies!
Ross, Noooo.
Rachel, Oh Ross  honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Phoebe, Yeah  why don't you just find another apartment?
Ross, Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!
Rachel, Y'know what you should do?
Ross, Huh?
Rachel, You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm  sandwiches. Or uh  or my underwear.
Joey, I'm listening.
Rachel,  See?
Ross, That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh  let's see now he had the trampoline.
Phoebe, He broke that.
Ross, Well  he had gravity boots.
Rachel, Yeah  he broke those too.
Joey, So he likes to break stuff.
Ross, Okay  I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey  didn't he used to have a cat?
Phoebe, I wouldn't bring that up  it would probably just bum him out.
Joey, Yeah  poor cat  never saw that big butt coming.
Ross, Right. 
Rachel, Hello!  Oh yeah! Hey! Hold on a second she's right here!  It's Chandler.
Phoebe,  Oh?  Hello you.
Chandler, Hello Phoebe  I've been thinking about you all day. 
Phoebe, Eh?
Chandler, Well you know that thing you said before  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Phoebe, Really?
Chandler, Yeah  listen  Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh  feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Phoebe, I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay  bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel, Are you kidding?!
Phoebe, No!
Rachel, I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey  do they know that we know?
Joey, No.
Rachel, Joey!
Joey, They know you know.
Rachel, Ugh  I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe, God  they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey  you can't say anything!
Joey, I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Ross, Good evening  sir. My name is Ross Geller. I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment. And I-I realize that the competition is fierce but—I'm sorry. I  I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you. Man  I wish I was naked. I mean  this-this looks so great. That is how God intended it.
Monica,  Look at them  they're-they're panicked!
Chandler, Oh yeah  they're totally gonna back down!
Monica, Oh yeah!
Phoebe, All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right  I'm gonna go in.
Rachel, All right. Be sexy.
Phoebe,  Please.
Phoebe, So Chandler  I-I'd love to come by tonight.
Chandler,  Really?
Phoebe, Oh absolutely. Shall we say  around seven?
Chandler, Yes.
Phoebe, Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Joey,  Hey-hey  check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Rachel, Oh yeah!  Oh my God! That is our friend!  It's Naked Ross! 
Rachel, Show time!
Phoebe, Okay  Rachel  get me perfume!
Rachel, Okay! 
Phoebe, And Joey  get me a bottle of wine and glasses? 
Monica, All right  it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!
Chandler, Okay  listen  how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Monica, Relax  she-she's gonna give in way before you do!
Chandler, How do you know?!
Monica, Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!
Chandler, At this?!
Monica, Just go get some!  Go! 
Rachel,  Okay honey  now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, Okay? Whoa  wait! 
Phoebe, Good idea!
Rachel, Yeah  oh wait! 
Phoebe, Oh now  don't give away the farm!
Chandler, Phoebe.
Phoebe, Chandler.
Chandler, Come on in.
Phoebe, I was going too.  Umm  I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Chandler, Sure.
Phoebe, So  here we are. Nervous?
Chandler, Me? No. You?
Phoebe, No  I want this to happen.
Chandler, So do I.
Chandler, I'm gonna put on some music.
Phoebe, Maybe  maybe I'll dance for you. 
Chandler, You look good.
Phoebe, Thanks! Y'know  that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!
Chandler, Well  why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Phoebe, Really?
Chandler, Oh  do you not want to?
Phoebe, No. No! It's just y'know first  I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
Chandler,  Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
Chandler, Listen  this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Monica, She's bluffing!
Chandler, Look  she's not backing down! She went like this! 
Phoebe, He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey,  Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Rachel, Joey look  just look at it this way  the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey, Ooh!
Rachel, Okay!
Joey, I like that!  Oh  okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! 
Phoebe, Joey!  Wow  you didn’t rip off any buttons.
Joey, It's not my first time.
Monica, You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler, Okay  give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Monica, Of course.
Chandler, Oh  you're-you're going?
Phoebe, Umm  not without you  lover.  So  this is my bra.
Chandler,  It's very  very nice. Well  come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler, Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe, Ooh.
Chandler, Well  I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe, Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe, And why not?!
Chandler, Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe, You're-you're what?!
Chandler, Love her! That's right  I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you  Monica.
Monica, I love you too Chandler. 
Phoebe, I just—I thought you guys were doing it  I didn't know you were in love!
Joey, Dude!
Chandler, And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Phoebe, God! 
Joey, All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica, Well actually  Ross doesn't.
Chandler, Yes  and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Ross, A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know  furnished.
Ross, Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
Ross, Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I—What?  No! Wh… What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ross, Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler  I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler  I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler,  Wow! Listen  we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean  that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So  good-bye  take care  bye-bye then! 
Monica, What are you doing?!
Chandler, Oh  I'm going on the lamb.
Monica, Come on Chandler  come on  I can handle Ross.   Hold on!  Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross, What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel,  Hey  what's-what's going on?!
Chandler, Well  I think  I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey,  Dude! He's right there!
Ross,  I thought you were my best friend  this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler, Look  we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay  I'm in love with her.
Monica, I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry  but it's true  I love him too.
Ross,  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.   You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too  huh? Big news!
Rachel, Awww  no  it's okay  we've actually known for a while.
Ross, What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!
Rachel, Well  Ross  we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
Ross,  You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react? 
Joey, Okay  all right  whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?  Hey-hey-hey  I-I-I'm just talking here  he-he's the one doing your sister.
Ross, Hey  you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…
Chandler,  Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Joey,  I call Godfather!
Ross, You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?
Joey, Sure  if you cared enough to call it first.
Monica, Guys  you're a few steps ahead of us.
Chandler, Yeah  big zero gravity moon steps.
Rachel, Oh! Oh  I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Phoebe, Ooh  I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
Rachel, Okay.
Joey,  Oh  hey Katie! Everyone  this is Katie.
Joey, So  are you ready to go?
Joey, Oh sure  right back there. 
Joey, I was thinking Chinese food.
Rachel, She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
Joey, I don't know. I mean I like her a lot  and she's really nice  but…
Monica, But what?
Joey,  She keeps punching me.
Monica, In that cute  little  sweet way she just did?
Joey, Hey  it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay?  She-she-she's hurting me.
Monica, I know what you need  you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross  what is Ben doing after preschool?
Chandler, Hey listen  come on  Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
Rachel, Aww  Joey  come here.  Look honey  I know this must be really  really difficult for you and I--Oh  I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Ross, Aww.
Phoebe, Yeah. Salt  so your life always has flavor.
Ross, Huh.
Phoebe, Bread  so you never go hungry.
Ross, Ohh.
Phoebe, And a scented candle for the bathroom  because well  y'know.
Ross, Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.
Phoebe, Yeah!
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.
Phoebe, Mr. President.
Ross, Howard?
Ross, Oh that's nice.
Ross, Oh. Uhh…
Ross, No-no  it's not that  it's just… I-I just moved in.
Ross, Yes  but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Ross, No wait  look. Look! I'm sorry  it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.
Ross, Yes but too me he's just  man.
Ross,  Ugh  can you believe that guy!
Phoebe, Yeah. I really like his glasses.
Ross, …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate  and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building  and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them  I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.
Chandler,  Sounds like a fun party.
Rachel, Hmm. Look  Ross  if you want your neighbors to like you  why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
Ross, It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!
Rachel, Okay  I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Ross, Oh  they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay  I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. 
Rachel, And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Chandler, Very  very funny  but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Rachel, Umm  Chandler  you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Chandler, Wh-wh-why?!
Rachel, Well  because she loves you and because you love her.
Chandler, Yeah  so  what's that supposed to mean?!
Rachel, Hey  Chandler  don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on  she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman  and she's almost 30  and y'know it's Monica.
Chandler, I don't see it that way. Okay? Because  I see two Monicas  the one that was my friend  who lived across the hall  and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica  who I just started to date. Now  who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
Rachel, No  you're right  you are absolutely right. I mean that makes  that makes everything different.
Chandler, Okay. It's not different at all  is it?
Rachel, Not unless different means the same.
Joey,  Y'know  breadstick fangs are always funny.
Joey, Uhh  look Katie  uh listen  we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm  look I like you. I-I really do  I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you  when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Monica, Isn't this great?
Chandler, Hmm.
Monica, Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Chandler, Yeah  here  somewhere else  y'know where-where ever. 
Monica, Are you okay?
Chandler, Yeah  I'm cool. Casual.
Monica, What-what are you doing?
Chandler, I'm just hanging out. Y'know  having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Monica, Man  I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!
Chandler, What?!
Monica, Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.
Chandler, Well  you do want all that stuff  right?
Monica, Oh and you know what I want!
Chandler, Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
Monica, I do not have baby fever!
Chandler, Oh please  you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea  why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Monica, Have you lost your mind? Chandler  this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!
Chandler, Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
Monica, You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! 
Chandler, Well  I did not know that.
Chandler, It's gonna be okay  right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is  this is fixable.
Chandler, By me?
Ross, Oh  no!
Joey, No-no.
Ross, Well  unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Joey, Yeah  big!
Joey, Uh-oh  shht! The Misses.
Monica, Gunther  can I get a coffee  to go?
Chandler, Monica. 
Monica, I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Chandler, Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
Monica, What?!
Chandler, Well  that's what we do. Y'know  I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
Monica, Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship  then don't be in one. 
Ross, Phoebe! 
Phoebe, Oh  hi Ross!
Ross, What are you doing?
Phoebe, Oh  I thought this was your party and it turns out it’s a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man! 
Ross, You chipped in?!
Phoebe, Yeah  uh-huh  a 100 dollars.
Ross, Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!
Phoebe, Yeah  but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know  the exotic  generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Ross, Yeah  but you're making me look bad!
Phoebe, No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Yeah  okay  my bad.
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi! Wow! You look  you look…big.
Joey, Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen  is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?
Rachel, Uhhh  yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Joey, Well look  I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean  if she hits me when she's happy  can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Joey, Hey! Hiya!
Rachel, Hey! Hey  cute jacket!
Rachel, Oh! Ow! 
Rachel, Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much. 
Rachel, Ohh  and the nicest girlfriend! 
Rachel, Ohh  you're so sweet! 
Joey, Huh.
Joey, Uhh….
Joey, Nah.
Ross,  Phoebe?
Phoebe,  That's what I'm saying. 
Ross,  Phoebe? Phoebe?
Phoebe, Ooh. 
Ross, Look  this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?
Phoebe, No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time  all right? Relax  get something to eat! Okay?
Ross, So uh  what did you tell them about me?
Phoebe, Oh  I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know  try to get some sympathy.
Ross, Ohh. 
Phoebe, But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
Ross, What?!
Phoebe, Yeah  I think I told it wrong. Y'know  we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ross,  Ohh  this cake is really good!
Phoebe, Oh  okay  see? Things are looking up already!
Phoebe," All right  everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money  he raised his own hand when I asked  ""Who hear likes Ross "" and he's wearing two nametags!  I-I'll be honest with you guys  when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean  all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean  I like all you guys now  but when I first meet you y'know Kurt  I thought  y'know abrasive drunk  umm Lola  mind numbingly stupid! And okay  you guys   Gold-digger   cradle robbing perv! So  I think you all know what I mean."
Phoebe, Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone  you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.
Ross, Oh wow  yeah! See  I did not get that.
Chandler, Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
Monica,  I'm Monica.
Chandler, I need to talk to you  it's urgent!
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Okay  I've been doing a lot of thinking about us  y'know a lot of uhh  us thinking. And uh  well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. 
Monica, Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Chandler,  Monica…
Monica, No-no  don't-don't-don't do it!
Chandler, Will you marry me?
Ross, Oh-no. No. No.
Joey, What a bad idea!
Rachel, Ohhhh  I cannot look at it! 
Monica, Chandler  why are you doing this?
Chandler, I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Monica, Chandler.
Chandler, I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Monica, Do you umm  you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Chandler, No  the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know  behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?
Monica,  Chandler  umm  I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Chandler, Yeah  I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Monica, Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Chandler, Yeah I know  but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. 
Monica, Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, She's right y'know.
Ross, Yeah  but still  cheap shot!
Monica, Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well  you're not ready for that.
Chandler, I didn't think I was!
Monica, Oh my God  what would have done if I said yes?
Chandler, Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or  you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. 
Joey, Hey Ross  will you pass me that knife?
Ross, No  I will not!
Joey, Oh  it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
Ross, You're right  I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Phoebe, Aw  and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Rachel, Oh no wait Pheebs  I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure  Chandler?
Chandler, Okay  how long is this going to go on.
Monica, Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so  a long time.
Ross," This is fun. Hey Rach  remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well  I'm sorry  will you marry me? "
Chandler, That's not funny.
Joey, That's not funny at all!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Joey, What are you guys doing up?
Chandler, Oh  we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey  do you know a six-letter word for red?
Joey,  Dark red.
Chandler, Yeah  I think that's wrong  but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey  how about maroon?
Monica,  Yes  you are so smart! 
Joey, Aww  you guys are so cute!
Monica, I know.
Joey, All right  I'll see you in the morning.
Rachel,  Uhh  we still need a tip.
Phoebe, All right. Hold on.  I got it. Nickel!  How much more do we need?
Rachel, A couple of bucks.
Phoebe, Okay  dime!  You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while.  Oh no  wait! Look it! Whoa!  Oh my God  this is a police badge!
Monica, Wow!
Chandler, Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually  could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Rachel, Phoebe  I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Phoebe, Yeah  I should probably take it back. Ooh  but you know what? While I'm at the police station  I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever  so this could be her year! 
Joey,  Hey  you guys!
Chandler, Hey!
Rachel, Hey Joey!
Monica, Hey.
Joey,  Hey. That uh  that my sweatshirt?
Monica, Oh yes  it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it  I was cold. I hope its okay?
Joey, Well uh  it's just that uh  y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.
Monica, I'm sorry  I'll give it back to you.
Joey, No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Monica, Are you saying I smell bad?
Joey, No! No  you smell like a meadow.  I'm sorry. 
Monica, What's with him?
Chandler, Oh  y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow  his mother was shot by a hunter.
Rachel,  Ugh!
Ross,"  Yeah  I still don't know.  I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says  ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says   ""Come here to me!"""
Rachel, What?! You say that to kids?!!
Ross," No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y'know for the ladies."
Rachel, Ross  honey  it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Oh  sure. Whoa-whoa  what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Rachel, Wait! No  that's ridiculous. Come on  he lives three blocks away!
Ross, Yeah  y'know what? I'll take it myself  thank you!  All right Rach  let's go! 
Rachel, Yeah!   Are you kiddin'?
Ross, Oh  come on it's only three blocks! And-and  it's not very heavy  try it! Come on! Come on!
Rachel,  Oh. Oh! I can do it!
Ross, Yeah!
Ross, Oh yeah  we're uh  yeah we're not together. 
Rachel, Ross!
Ross, What's that supposed to mean?
Rachel, Ross!
Ross, Not that it's any of your business  but we did go out.
Ross, Yeah! Rach?
Rachel, Come on  I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Ross, Then tell him quickly.
Rachel,  Fine!  We went out.
Ross, Not only did we go out  we did it 298 times!
Rachel, Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!
Ross, A loser you did it with  298 times!
Phoebe, Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me  ma'am?
Phoebe, You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!
Phoebe, No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.
Phoebe, Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!
Phoebe, Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.
Phoebe, Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer  you apologize to the tree.
Phoebe, You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.   Backup! Backup!!
Phoebe, Okay  cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Ross, Okay. 
Rachel, Ross  didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Ross, Uhh  yes I did but there isn't. Okay  here we go.
Ross, Okay  go left. Left! Left! 
Rachel, Okay  y'know what? There is no more left  left!
Ross, Oh okay  lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Good-good-good.
Rachel, Oh-oh!
Ross, Yeah  you got it right? You got it right? You got it?
Rachel, Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
Phoebe, …so this guy was all  And I'm all  Buffay  Homicide.  It was just so cool!
Monica,  Phoebe  you were supposed to take that back!
Phoebe, I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Chandler, Okay  but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Phoebe, You could get arrested  right now!  All right  yeah  I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. 
Phoebe,  Hey.
Joey,  Hey!  Oh.
Chandler, Hi  Joe.
Joey, Yeah  I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.
Monica, Hey Joey  sweetie  taste this. 
Joey,  What?! Why?!
Monica, What is going on with you?
Joey, Nothing!
Chandler, Oh  come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Joey, All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream   but I don't want to talk about it. 
Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.
Joey, Well  it involved Monica.
Chandler, You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh  that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? 
Joey, Don't worry  there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Monica, What was the dream about?
Joey, Well  okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So  that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Monica, Wait  Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!
Joey, It-it doesn’t?
Monica, No!
Chandler, No  it can mean anything. Like uh  all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Joey, That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Monica, Or  it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Joey, In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Monica, Um-hmm.
Chandler, Joey  look  are you attracted to Monica? Right here  right now  are you attracted to her?
Joey,  Not really.
Chandler, Well there you have it!
Monica, Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me  because you just want a girlfriend!
Joey, No  I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean  yeah  I can get a girlfriend! Yeah  we could sit in the chair and do crosswords  but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Chandler, Well y'know  Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Joey, Friends first? That's interesting.
Monica, You become friends after?
Joey, No  never done that either.
Rachel,  Hey  umm  do you guys have that tape measure?
Chandler, Oh yeah  it's actually in my bedroom.
Monica,  That's right.
Rachel,  What's up Joey?
Joey,  How you doin'?
Phoebe, Excuse me  is this your car?
Phoebe, Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here  y'know you're blocking the entrance.
Phoebe, Well  it's a problem for me  which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop. 
Phoebe, Ohh  no.  Oh okay  so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere  'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. So  all right  keep up the good work. 10-4. 
Phoebe, I-I'm with the umm  the 57th.
Phoebe, I'm in vice. Yeah  in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Phoebe, Umm  do you know  umm Sipowicz?
Phoebe, Yeah  big guy  kinda bald.
Phoebe,  Don’t try to call him or anything  'cause he's not there  he's out. His umm  his partner just died.
Phoebe, I-I sure will  take care. 
Phoebe, Oh. 
Rachel, Hey! Joey  would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Joey, Oh  I'd love too  but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off   for you.
Rachel, Thanks!
Joey, Uh  hey  Rach let me ask you something. Uh  I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler  boy they are really tight.
Rachel, I know.
Joey, Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
Rachel, What's up Joe?
Joey, Well  the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey," …is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself  ""Who are my friends?"" You and Phoebe  and I saw you first. So…"
Rachel,  What are you saying?
Joey, I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Rachel, Y'know honey  umm  as uh  as flattered as I am that uh  you saw me first  uhh  I just  I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
Joey, I'll treat you real nice. 
Rachel,  Yeah  well  y'know umm… No honey  listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them  but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone  become their friend  build a foundation  then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!
Joey, Won't-won't that take longer?
Rachel, Yeah. Yeah. Oh  but once you find it  ohh it's so worth the wait.
Joey, Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man  I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Ross, Come here to me. No-no  you come here to me.
Rachel,  Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Ross, Oh great! What  you brought Joey?
Rachel, Well  I brought the next best thing.
Chandler,  Hey!
Ross, Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!
Chandler, Y'know  I would be offended  but Monica is freakishly strong  so…
Ross, Look  I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.  Okay Rach   that's you. That's the couch. 
Rachel, Whoa-oh  what's-what's that? 
Ross, Oh  that's me.
Rachel, Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
Ross, No! That's-that's my arm!
Chandler,  Oh  I see. I thought you just really  really liked your new couch.
Ross, Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.
Rachel, Okay!
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, Come on  Chandler.
Ross, All right.  Okay  here we go!
Ross, All right  ready?
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross, Turn.
Chandler,  Okay.
Ross, Turn! Turn!
Chandler, Okay  I don't think we can turn anymore!
Rachel, Ross  I don't  I just don't think it's going to fit.
Ross, Oh yeah it will! Come on  up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!
Chandler, Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Ross, Okay  I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.
Ross, All right  let's uh  let's bring it back down and-and try again.
Chandler, Okay  yeah  I think it's really stuck now.
Ross, I can't believe that didn't work!
Rachel, I know  me neither! I mean  you had a sketch!
Chandler, Oh  y'know  what did you mean when you said pivot?
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Joey, Yeah  yeah  I met this woman. 
Chandler,  Hey  whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Joey, Uhh  well  she's…really good in bed.
Monica, Joey  I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Joey,  Well look  hey  it's all your fault!
Rachel, What?! Why?!
Joey, Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know  build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly  through no fault of my own  became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!
Monica, What about the closeness?
Joey, Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
Joey,  All right! Hey  who wants pizza?!
Chandler, Ooh  I do! I do! I do!
Joey,  Oh  great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
Monica, Who is it?
Joey, Uhh  just a minute officer!!
Phoebe, Ooh  God  it's him! It's that cop! God  I can't believe it! He found me!
Rachel, Oh my God  Phoebe  are you gonna go to jail?!
Phoebe, Well  if I'm going down  I'm taking you  with me.  Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum. Good luck Chandler.  Okay  you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Phoebe, Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Phoebe, I would love it if I weren't here!
Phoebe, Me?!
Phoebe, Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Phoebe, Umm  yeah  I'd like to go out with you officer…
Phoebe, Gary.
Phoebe, Yeah! So--ooh  I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Phoebe, Ohh  impressive.
Phoebe, Yeah  we'll talk at dinner.
Phoebe, All right  I can't wait!
Chandler,  He has a gun!
Ross, I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
Ross, That's what I'm telling you.
Ross, This couch  is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
Ross, Look  I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
Ross,  I take it.
Rachel, Good  you guys are all here!
Ross, Hey! What's up?
Rachel, Well  I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
Rachel, I know!
Joey, Boy  that guy's underwear sucks!
Rachel, Wh-what?!
Joey, I got this pair marked excess  I gotta tell ya  there was no room for excess anything in there.
Rachel, Anyway  I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection  I'll work right under the director  it's the perfect  perfect job for me!
Phoebe, Wow! Well  if you nail the interview  you'll get it!
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, You wanna work on your interview skills?
Rachel, O-okay!
Phoebe, Okay! All right  let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Rachel, Hi.
Phoebe, Very good handshake  good wrist action.
Monica, Let me try. 
Phoebe, Okay.  Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! 
Monica, Did I squeeze it too hard?
Phoebe, Let's just say  I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Joey, That's right Ross  I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday   same as the day before.
Monica, Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Joey, Nope. Op  wait! There he goes.
Joey,  Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay.  Oh no-no-no  I wasn't waving at you lady.   Whoa  maybe I was! Hey  Monica  this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Monica, Get in there man! Flirt back  mix it up!
Joey, Yeah  I-I-I'm down with that.  Okay  here goes.  How  you  a-doin'?   It worked! She's waving me over.  Okay  I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see  she's on the third floor…
Monica,  Wow! She is pretty  huh?
Joey, Tell me about it  huh?  Oh no-no-no  I'm not with her  she's just Monica!  Ewwuck! 
Ross, Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Joey, This is your place?
Ross, Of course it is. Yeah  come on in. Ooh-ooh  go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. 
Joey, But I counted  you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! 
Joey, Ugh!!
Monica, What happened?
Joey, I ended up at Ross's place. Oh  I musta missed counted or something.  Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh  l-l-look  Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. 
Monica, No Joey  I think he's just watchin' TV.
Phoebe, But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Phoebe, Okay  then maybe I can come too!
Phoebe, All right  you go. 
Phoebe, 'Kay  bye!
Phoebe, Oh God!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Oh I just miss him so much!
Monica, Wow! For just a week you guys are really close  huh?
Phoebe, Yeah  it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet  he's like this little puppy dog  y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh  I just love beginning parts of relationships  y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Monica, I know it is the best.
Phoebe, So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Monica, What? It's still going on.
Phoebe, Come on  seriously! When did it end?
Monica, I-I am serious  I mean  we're  we're all over each other all the time.
Phoebe, Okay  you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Monica,   What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Phoebe,  God  I woke the beast. Sorry.  I was wrong obviously  I just—I misspoke. It's okay.
Monica, Oh no  it is okay  I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery  just as hot as you! I mean our flame  whew  is on fire!
Chandler,  Hey Monica  here's your broom back.
Monica, You are so cute. 
Chandler, Oh hey  how'd the interview go?
Rachel, Ugh  horrible! I did the stupidest  most embarrassing thing!
Joey, Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Rachel, No!
Chandler, So what happened?
Rachel," Ugh  it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well  y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like  ""Well  yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!""  Trust me  it was actually  it was very funny. Anyway  so we were saying good-bye and ugh!"
Joey, What happened?
Rachel,  All right  we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open the door  but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… 
Joey, You kissed him?!
Rachel, Well  I didn't know what else to do!
Chandler, Well you coulda tried  not kissing him.
Rachel, Thanks Chandler.
Monica,  Hey Rach  a guy from Ralph Lauren called  you got a second interview!
Rachel, I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Monica, Yes!
Joey, I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now  is it?
Rachel, What-what  wait a minute  you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Joey, Yeah!  No?
Monica, A kiss? What are you talking about?
Rachel," I accidentally kissed him in the interview  and now he wants me back y'know of course  'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
Chandler, Come on  Rach.
Rachel, Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Monica, He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Rachel, Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God  how could I be so stupid?!
Joey, Oh Rachel look  don't say that  I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!
Rachel, Ohh  well I'm not totally back yet  but thank you.
Joey, No  in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay  wait there  I'll be over in a second.  Got it! 
Chandler, I gotta check out this hot girl!  There she is! 
Joey, Damnit!! Did you move?!
Ross, Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
Joey,  Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
Joey, Yeah. Sorry about that.  Oh  hey little girl. Uhh  is-is your mommy  or sister  or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
Joey, Later!  Oh man!  Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Thank you.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Excuse me?
Rachel,  Wh-whoa! All right  okay-okay  I see  I see what's going on here! Now listen  look-look  I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression  but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I   hey-hey-hey  even though I kissed you  that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want  this job that bad. Good day  sir. 
Rachel,  Ugh  you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Rachel, Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Ross, You got ink on your lip.
Rachel, Oh.  Ohhhhhhhhh….
Chandler,  So what do you say  maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Chandler, Oh  what can happen? I mean  would you… 
Monica, Phoebe  do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Phoebe, Oh we can't  we already have plans.
Monica, What are you doing?
Phoebe, Well  same thing we did all day  hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing  we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Monica,  Oh  we're not seeing a movie!
Phoebe, You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Monica, Oh umm  that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were  y'know  doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Monica, Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Chandler, Uh  yeah.
Monica, Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Chandler, Why?
Monica, 'Cause  Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Chandler, Ohh  so?
Monica, So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Chandler, Monica  you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean  just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this  why? Get your coat.
Ross,  Hey!
Ross,  Who isn't?
Ross, I don't  I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
Ross, Nevermind! 
Ross, I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…
Ross, Jen  I know this may sound a little… But uh  would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime  or…
Ross, Umm?
Ross, I will give you a call.
Ross, Okay!
Chandler, That was amazing!
Monica, Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Chandler, That was amazing.
Monica, We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Chandler, No  you're the best.
Monica, No  you're the best.
Chandler, No  you're the best.
Monica, I am the best.
Joey,  Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'? 
Monica,  Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Joey, I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah  yeah  that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter  I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Monica, Why?
Joey, Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe  or something.
Monica, What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor  seventh apartment from the left!
Joey, No. No. No. She lives on the third floor  eighth apartment from the left.
Monica, No  those first two windows   that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there  that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey, I did not know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Ross, So uhh  you ready?
Ross, Sure.  Joey…
Joey, Dahhhhh!!  No! Noooo!! 
Rachel, Ah  first  I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Rachel,  Okay. Umm  well  first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh  for yelling at you.
Rachel, Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah   who did  who did not umm  yell at you and storm out  and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back  that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job  I said no. That shows integrity. And  I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm  now I know I already said courage  but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm  and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace  I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way  litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry  I had to look it up too.} So there you go  you got  you got  courage  you got integrity  you got  courage again  and not litigious. Look Mr…
Rachel, Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really  really want this job and I think  I think I would be really good at it.
Rachel,  Oh! You are?
Rachel, Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh  would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Rachel, Okay  well then how about a handshake?  Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God  I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh  okay  so thank-thank you  I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh  thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! 
Phoebe, You tired Chandler?
Monica, You better believe he's tired  after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Chandler, Honey  the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Chandler, Oh yeah  it's so cool.  Now I gotta go  Officer Bing has gotta  10-100.  That's pee-pee. 
Monica, Phoebe  you have a  a twig in your hair.
Phoebe, Ohh   umm  we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Monica, You didn't!
Phoebe, We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Monica, The park huh? A public place.
Monica, I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! 
Monica, Hi Chandler.
Chandler, Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?
Monica, Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Chandler, No. And if I did  I don't think we'd be going out. Monica  this is getting ridiculous!
Monica, Come on  we can't let them win!
Chandler, Ugh  we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Monica, Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Chandler,  So?
Monica, I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.
Chandler, Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Monica, Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Chandler, Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth  I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time  I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you  yeah I think that's pretty exciting. 
Monica, That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm  I feel the same way.
Chandler, Yeah?
Monica, Yeah. 
Chandler, Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Monica, Did not.
Chandler, Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Monica, Okay  I freaked out a little.
Chandler, Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy  irrational screw up!   And now we're back.
Rachel,  I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Monica, Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Chandler,  You guys ready fore the movies?
Rachel, Yeah! Oh by the way  thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Ross,  Man! They cannot get enough! 
Joey, Okay  pick a card.
Chandler, Okay. 
Joey, All right now  memorize it.  You got it?
Chandler, Oh yes.
Joey,  Is that your card? 
Chandler,  Yes.
Ross, Hi!
Chandler, Hi there!
Phoebe, What are you talking about?!
Ross,  Well  it's not for sure but umm  we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know  which he is--so umm anyhoo  he uh  he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Joey,  Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!  Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!  I mean  way to go Ben!  Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
Ross, I know  it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…
Joey, I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
Chandler, That.
Rachel,  Okay  gotta go! Wish me luck!
Joey, Luck!
Chandler, Hey Rach  now that you're working at Ralph Lauren  can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Rachel, Uh well  y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
Chandler, Unwilling to steal from work  interesting.
Monica, Besides  if anybody's gonna get free stuff  it's gonna be me.
Rachel, Okay guys  way to wish me luck!
Phoebe, Okay  let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Joey, Whoa-whoa  but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Phoebe, Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday  then it's not a surprise.
Monica, I think it's a great idea. Yeah  we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Joey, Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Ross,  Okay!!
Joey, Done.
Phoebe, Okay  great so do you want to do it together?
Monica, I would love to do it together!
Joey, They're gonna do it together.
Chandler, Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Joey, What  so I gotta shut it down now?
Ross, All right  I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Monica, It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Weirder than watching his two moms make out? 
Joey, Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Ross, Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Joey, Whoa  hey  maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Ross, You're not his godfather.
Joey, What?! Are you kidding?!
Ross,  Of course I am!  Okay  let's go godfather.
Joey, All right!
Joey, Hey! I'm in  they're gonna let me audition!
Ross, Really? That's great!
Joey, I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play  so I steered clear of her…
Joey, Oh yeah  yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks  Playstation  and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one  he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….
Ross, Yeah well  he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him  look at you  
Joey, That's great. Listen  wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Ross, Joey  you look nothing like Ben.
Joey, I look more like him than you do! 
Rachel, Well umm  that one is pretty but uh  I just  I just love this fabric  Sorry.
Rachel,  Oh  what a fun office.
Rachel, Oh no  my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
Rachel, …and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
Monica, That doesn't seem fair.
Rachel, I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting  poisoning habit!
Chandler, Yeah  it is the best.
Rachel, I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know  they'll-they'll be outside smoking  making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air  y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us  who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Monica, Rachel  you can go down there  you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Rachel, Yeah  I can do that.
Chandler, Yeah  or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey Rach  you wanna get some coffee?
Rachel, I would love to!
Phoebe, Oh good!
Chandler, Yeah  I wanna go to babe.
Phoebe, Oh good.
Phoebe, Oh wait  I change my mind!  Okay  let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas! 
Monica, Yeah  me too! 
Phoebe, Oh  look at that.
Monica, All right  that's a little sketch of the cake  umm some sample menus  umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food  and for music  here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
Phoebe, What happened to the intimate dinner party?
Monica, Oh  we're not doing that. Okay…
Phoebe, So wow  it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot  co-host.
Monica, What?! I didn't take care of everything  there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Phoebe, Like what?
Monica,  Cups.
Phoebe, Cups? You're giving me cups?
Monica, And ice!
Phoebe, Cups and ice? Ooh  I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine  okay  I will be in charge of cups and ice!
Monica, Wait a minute  I can get ice at the restaurant…
Phoebe, I got it! Mine!
Ross,  Hi.
Monica, Hey! How'd the audition go?!
Ross, Not so good.
Monica," Wait a minute  are you doing Joey's  ""Audition didn't go so well.  Yeah it did?"""
Ross,  Yeah I am! Yeah  Ben got a second audition!
Joey,  Yeah  I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
Monica, You got a callback too didn't you?
Joey,  Yeah I did!
Rachel, Oh well  it's kinda lonely up there  so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Rachel, Oh great!
Rachel, Oh that's okay.
Rachel, Excuse me  can I  can I bum one of those?  Y'know what  actually…  Okay  okay  okay  what's so funny over here?
Rachel," Oh  I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes  y'know? Y'know what I mean  like dubbies? And I actually  I thought to myself  ""Wow  those guys are crazy!"" But no  I actually smoke the regular ones all  all the time."
Rachel, Oh  me too.
Rachel,  Oh  me too.
Ross, Oh God  this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
Joey, Well  unfortunately  I don't get many callbacks so…
Joey, Who knows?
Ross, Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!
Joey, Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, Man  this is gonna be kinda weird.
Ross, Yeah  it is.
Ross, No  we-we're gonna be like best friends  that's why it's gonna be weird.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Phoebe, Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
Chandler, Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Phoebe, Umm  cups.
Chandler, Oh good  because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Ross, Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Phoebe, Yeah well  that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice  and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
Chandler, Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
Phoebe, Okay  time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh  hi Joey!
Joey, Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Ross good  I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Ross, What's up?
Joey, Well  I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing  y'know me going up against Ben  the two of us competing  and that can't lead to anything good. So  I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Ross, Wow  uh  Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Joey, That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Ross, Well  you just…
Joey, I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross  if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Ross, What?!
Joey, What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Chandler,  Well I mean  let me get the door first.  Oh  hi! No one. 
Ross, Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh  tag-a-long dad.
Joey, At least I care about his feelings!
Ross, What?!
Joey, Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
Ross, And why wouldn't he get it?
Joey, Oh  come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Ross, Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Joey, You just give him a spoon baby!
Ross, Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Joey, Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Ross, You're kid's name is Raymond!
Joey, Yeah?! So's yours!
Monica,  How did work go?
Rachel, Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said  y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
Monica, You stink!
Rachel, Thanks!
Monica, No  I'm-I'm serious!
Rachel, Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
Chandler, Okay  there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
Rachel, I did not!
Chandler, Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
Rachel, All right  fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
Chandler, I wish I had smoked for my career…
Monica, That's so gross!
Rachel, No well  no it's not that bad  y'know? I mean yeah  my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell  I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler, Okay  but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Monica, Chandler! I have to tell you  you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. 
Chandler, I think you smell great! 
Rachel, I am so on board! 
Rachel, Yeah  I did  but y'know what? I am really  really trying to cut back  y'know?  Good luck  Rach.
Rachel, Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Rachel, Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Rachel, Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it! 
Rachel, Okay then! 
Joey, Hmmm  soup!  Hmm soup!  Hmm  soup!
Joey, Oh yeah  no problem.
Joey,  Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya  it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray  the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Ross,  Joey!
Joey,  Ross!
Ross,  Ben!   I mean  Ben! Ben!
Joey, Hi!
Joey, Uh-oh.
Joey, Well this is noodle soup and uh  I've been working with tomato. But that's okay  no problem. No problem. Hmm  noodle soup.
Joey, Oh  what did I say?
Joey, How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
Joey, Hmm  noodle soup.
Joey, Okay.
Joey, Hmm  soup.  I mean  noodle soup. I mean soup!
Joey, No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm  noodle soup. Damnit! 
Rachel, Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
Rachel, Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
Rachel, Well y'know if you  if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on  give me one of those! What are we talking about?
Rachel, Oh wait  no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
Rachel, Okay. 
Rachel,  Oh man!
Phoebe,  Check it out! Cup hat!  Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all  the cup! 
Chandler, Great job with the cups  Pheebs!
Monica,  Why don't you just go out with her!
Phoebe,  And did you notice the ice?  Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch!  Ahhh! Mystical!
Chandler, Awesome!
Monica, Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Chandler, There are snow cones!  Snow cones! Yuck!
Monica, Y'know…go! Go! Right there! 
Chandler, Thank you! Thank you! 
Phoebe,  Oh  look! Look! Look!
Rachel, What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Monica, That's the surprise!
Rachel, Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Rachel, Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
Phoebe, I was in charge of cups.
Rachel, Oh  okay  not so weird.
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey.
Ross, Listen man  uh  I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
Joey, Yeah right! 
Ross, No really  I-I am! I feel bad!
Joey," Yeah? Well look Ross  you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say  ""Hmm  noodle soup."" "
Ross, Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck  maybe you messed up because you care more about uh  your godson.
Joey, What you do mean?
Ross, I think  sub-consciously…
Joey, Wait-whoa-whoa  you lost me.
Ross,  I think on some level  you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
Joey, Well  you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…
Ross, No!
Joey, No  it's just ah  I care so damn much about little Ben that uh  it was more important to see him succeed.
Ross, There you go. Thank you!
Joey, Thank you! So  did-did he get it?
Ross, No.
Joey, Eh  what are you gonna do?
Chandler,  Oh  hi! Excuse me  is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Chandler, Okay  great.
Chandler, I'll catch you guys later. 
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?
Chandler, Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary  we've got reservations at Ja George.
Ross, Wow! How'd you get in there?
Chandler, Made a few calls  pulled some strings  and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Chandler, Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Chandler, Yeah  if that was true  gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Chandler, Oh  okay.  Here you go.
Chandler, Oh  he's in the back. The duck pissed him off  said that eggs came first.
Chandler, Okay  bye!
Ross, What the hell was that?!
Chandler, What?
Ross, The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with  I don't know hmm  let's say my sister?!
Chandler, I was not flirting.
Ross," It was totally flirting. ""Somebody got a haircut """
Chandler, Okay first of all  the impression  uncanny. And second  that was not flirting  that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Ross, Yeah  right.
Chandler, You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. 
Ross,  I'm good.
Rachel, I am so proud of Joey  I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!
Phoebe, I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
Rachel, No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Phoebe, Don't get me started on that.
Chandler, I was not flirting.
Ross, And on your anniversary  for shame!
Rachel, What's going on?
Ross, Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Chandler, I was not and oh God  shh!
Ross, Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single  the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Phoebe, Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Ross, Well…
Chandler, Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Rachel, Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.
Ross, Well  I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Rachel, Hm-mmm.
Ross, And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
Rachel, Okay  y'know what? We don't need her measurements.
Phoebe,  Okay pepperoni  pepperoni  pepperoni  okay Ross  I know she's pretty and you love her  but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Ross, This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza  and when she does  I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Phoebe, See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Joey,  Hey everybody  look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Rachel, Big night!
Phoebe, This is so cool!
Chandler, So  Joey on Law & Order  you must be very proud!
Joey, Chandler  she doesn't understand a word of English.
Chandler, I'm sorry  I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.  I've done it again.
Joey, She's my biggest fan. Yeah  she's the only one in the family that's believed in me.
Joey, Yeah  I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so…
Monica,  Hey! Happy Anniversary!
Chandler, Happy Anniversary  10 months! 
Monica, So umm  when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London…
Chandler, Uhh  Joey's grandmother is right there. 
Monica, Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
Chandler, The one that doesn't.
Monica, That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.
Chandler, Hey  why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Monica, That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  You have got to go home!
Phoebe, But I like it here!
Monica, You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Phoebe, Okay  well I think that they're in my purse. Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them.
Monica, Great!
Phoebe, Okay!  Rach  hi  I need those earrings you borrowed.
Rachel, Oh  umm  okay  yeah  I'll be  yeah I'll be right back. 
Joey, Wow Pheebs  you speak Italian?
Phoebe, I guess so. 
Rachel,  Here you go. Thank you!
Phoebe, Wait  Rach! Where's the other one?
Rachel, Oh what  you-you want both of them?
Phoebe, Rachel Karen Green  where's the other earring?!
Rachel, Okay  okay  okay  look  just don't freak out  but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment  but I definitely lost it.
Phoebe, Well  what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Rachel, Tell her to wear her own earrings.
Phoebe, These are her earrings.
Rachel, Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
Phoebe, Why not?
Rachel, Because I lose her stuff!
Joey, Okay  see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Joey, Oh umm  my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.
Chandler," If you said  ""Big lima bean  bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?"
Monica,  Rach? What are you doing?
Rachel, Oh boy  I just can't watch. It's too scary!
Monica, It's a diaper commercial.
Rachel, Oh yeah well  you know me  babies  responsibilities  ahhh!!!
Ross, I'll get it! I will get that! 
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Oh. Uh  by the way  if it makes you feel any better. I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
Ross,  The uh  your hair  before  your hair  you said you thought your looks like an 8-year-old's  and I'm just saying I like it. The hair.
Ross, You understand I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
Chandler, Here you go.  Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
Chandler, You're welcome.
Ross, You couldn't let me have her  could ya?!
Chandler, What?
Ross, This is a girl that I really like and had too swoop in there!
Monica, What's goin' on?
Ross, Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Chandler, Thank you for that!  I was not flirting.
Monica, It's okay. I don't care. It's uh  it's fine.
Ross, Really?!
Chandler, Really?!
Monica, It's no big deal  I do it all the time.
Chandler,  So umm  you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Monica, Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Chandler, Okay  but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Joey,  True story! 
Monica, Chandler  this actually bothers you?
Chandler, Yes  it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel  when you were going out with Ross  did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Rachel, Uhh  no  no  it bothered me when he slept with other women.
Ross, And thank you  for that.
Rachel, But y'know  I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
Ross, What?  What-what  what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
Rachel, Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet  you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
Ross, All right  all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here  you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will  I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
Phoebe,  I found it!
Rachel, Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
Phoebe, On your dresser.
Rachel, Okay that is the one we already have!
Joey, Okay  here's my big scene. My big scene's here!  Oh my God.
Monica, What?
Joey,  Okay  everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
Chandler,  Well  what is it?
Joey,  Oh  they cut me out of the show.
Rachel,  What?!
Ross,  Are you sure?
Phoebe,  Maybe your scene's coming up?
Joey,  Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there
Rachel,  Yeah.
Joey,  I'm in it.
Phoebe,  This is terrible  what are you going to do?
Joey,  I don't know. This little  old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
Phoebe,  That's not good.
Joey,  No  smile! Not that face  smile! Everybody smile! 
Rachel,  Joey  why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
Chandler,  If we keep talking this way  aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Joey, Soon  soon  I'm gonna be on soon. There I am! 
Joey, No-no-no  that-that's me  that's me.
Chandler," Doesn't know  ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One."
Monica,  Phoebe! I have to have those earrings  we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
Phoebe, But I already gave them back to you!
Monica, No you didn't.
Phoebe, All right  I already didn't give them back to you  that's what I said.  Where is that other earring?
Rachel, It's not here Pheebs  it's not here. Ohh  I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay! 
Phoebe, Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Rachel, Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Phoebe, Okay  we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Ross,  Hey Pheebs! How's that uh  vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on  huh?
Phoebe,  Why are you being weird?
Ross, Do you like it?
Phoebe," No  that would be  ""Why are you being cute?"""
Ross, Okay  I'm working on my flirting.
Phoebe, Ohh! I did not get that.
Chandler, So uh Monica  do you  do you like the Law & Order?
Monica, Yeah  it's good.
Chandler, See  I'm finding out all this stuff about you today  like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Monica, Chandler!  Okay  let me get this straight  it's okay for you to flirt  but not for me.
Chandler, Oh  I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look  I'm sorry  some things are different for men and for women.
Monica, Go on  teach me something about men and women.
Chandler," Okay  I've already taught you so much already  but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think  ""I'm just flirting  no big deal."" But the guy is thinking  ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
Monica, No way!
Chandler, It's true.
Monica, Well that's pathetic!
Chandler, Again true.
Monica, And this goes for all guys?
Chandler, All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Joey,  All right  it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Ross, Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
Joey, I know  I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!
Monica, No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
Joey,  Yeah  all right.  Ooh! 
Chandler, Uh  Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile  let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So  you're old and small.
Rachel,    Hey!
Phoebe, Did you find it?
Rachel, The earring? No. But look  I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer. 
Phoebe, Okay  those are my sunglasses  you borrowed them from me.
Rachel, Okay  calm down  here they are. 
Monica,  Phoebe! 
Phoebe,  What are we going to do?!
Rachel, I don't know  I don't know.
Phoebe, All right well  we're just gonna have to tell Monica  that's all.
Rachel, Oh gosh  she's going to kill me.
Phoebe, I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Rachel, Ohh that'd be great!
Phoebe, Mon  can I talk to you for a sec?
Monica, Yeah  what is it?
Phoebe, Umm  I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so  so sorry!
Monica,  Wow! All right well  I mean  what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Phoebe, I will replace it  I promise. I feel so terrible.
Monica, All right  sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Phoebe, No.
Monica, Look at you! Come here!  Feel better?
Phoebe, Yeah! You're the best!
Rachel, Okay  wait a minute. Wait a minute  I-I-I  I can't do this. Listen honey  this is  it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings  and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey  I feel terrible too. 
Monica,  That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!!  Okay?! I mean  first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry  it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater  it's my sunglasses!
Rachel, Your sunglasses?!
Monica, Yes!
Phoebe, Oh  right! 
Ross,  Oh  mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay  here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.
Chandler, Okay  hold on.  Okay. 
Rachel, Honey  you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl  I don't flirting is the right thing to… 
Ross, You'll see. Okay.  Oh  what's-what's her name?
Ross,  Hey! Oh  we-we can't keep eating like this. 
Ross, Okay   so  do you make the pizzas in one of those uh  wood-burning ovens?
Ross, Gas? Wow! Intense.
Chandler,  If this is the way all the Gellers flirt  we don't have a problem.
Ross,  Hey uh  y'know that smell gas has?
Ross, They put that in.
Ross, The gas is odorless  but they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Ross, A lot of other gas smells…
Chandler, Oh the humanity.
Ross, Meth-methane smells…
Ross, Oh but I-I-I haven't paid you yet!
Ross,  Was I talking to her about gas?
Chandler, More so than anything else.
Phoebe, I-I-I found it interesting.
Rachel, I'm sorry.
Ross, Look  no-no  hey  hey  don't worry about it! In nine years  she and I will be right there. 
Rachel, Okay  well  I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes. 
Phoebe,  Ross?
Ross, Yeah?
Phoebe, What else do they add smell too?
Rachel, Hey! Hey!  Hi! Hey-hey-hey  I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?
Rachel, No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh  actually umm my friend Ross. He uh  just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, I know  I know  but uh just  I'm telling you  once  once you get past that part  that where it-it just feels like you wanna die  he's-he's really a good person.
Rachel, Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh  got a good heart. And besides  I y'know  I think he really likes you.
Rachel, Well y'know  we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas  what do you think?
Rachel,  Hey Ross? Umm  I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh  you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
Ross, What do you mean?
Rachel, Well  I don't get it  but she wanted me to give you her phone number. 
Ross, And she just gave you this?
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, Rach  thanks but uh  I don't need you doing me any favors.
Rachel, I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.
Ross, Well that I can believe.
Rachel, Yay!
Joey,  Hey! Is the show still on?
Chandler, Almost over man.
Joey,  Look! Oh!  Is that the Pope?! 
Chandler, Why am I looking?
Joey, Oh  here I am  here's my big scene!
Joey,  All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
Joey, That's right!
Chandler, You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Joey,  Now  I wanna a suitcase filled with 100 000 dollars.  Choo! Choo! Choo!  Filled with $100 000 in small bills  and if I don't get it… Choo!! And if I don't get it   I'm gonna shoot this duck!

Phoebe, Oh  then no.
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Hi!
Chandler, You ready?
Monica, Yeah.
Chandler, You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Monica, Ohh  you're about to get a little luckier.
Chandler, Let me see the earrings.
Monica, Oh  honey  the earrings…
Chandler,  They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
Monica, My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Chandler,  Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Ross, Hm-mmm.
Monica, Okay  guys  listen  don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again  so whatever we do  just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
Joey, Oh  yeah  good idea.
Chandler, Hey man  what's up?
Ross,  Oh  eh  just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow. 
Joey, Ooh  Ross  look! Look! 
Ross,  What? Where?
Joey, Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
Ross, What am I looking at?
Joey,  Somebody help me out here!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Monica  I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.
Joey, You got to go on a ride along?!
Phoebe, Uh-huh!
Joey, I want to go on a ride along!
Ross, Me too!
Chandler, Yeah  yeah! Me too!
Chandler, Yeah.
Chandler, Well  I like danger.
Chandler, Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, Hey! Oh  I'm so glad you're home  I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Rachel, Ohh  thank God! Finally!
Monica, Okay  I've broken them down into categories. Okay  we have uh  we got holidays  birthdays  candids  y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up  oh let's say birthdays and dogs  you get Photo 152. See? 
Rachel, Ohh  it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
Monica, You can also find him under umm  dog and dead.
Rachel, Great! Thanks!
Monica, All right  hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Oops. Sorry! Well  good thing you number all of them  huh?
Monica, I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Rachel, Ohhhh. Honey  honey  honey  it's okay  it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink  huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross, Ross has the blender! Ugh  everything's just falling apart!
Rachel, No honey  it's okay! Listen  I'll got to Ross's and get the blender  you get all the margarita stuff ready.
Monica, All right  he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Rachel, Okay  you want me to stop at the ATM?
Monica, Nah  while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…
Rachel, What?!
Monica, What?! I-I-I don't  I don't do that!
Ross,  That was so cool man  the way you leaned on that guy.
Chandler, It is starting to get dark out there.
Ross,  He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
Chandler,  Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.
Ross, Oh hey  Gary  want me to grab the berry for ya?
Ross, It's the—Chandler!!
Joey,  Okay  I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Joey, Oh-ho  yeah!
Joey, Yep!
Joey,  Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Chandler, Your tax dollars?
Joey, Yeah  okay.
Chandler,  Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Joey, Did I say you could smell it?!
Chandler, I can't smell your sandwich?
Joey, Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Chandler, Okay  I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Joey, Okay  imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, Are you thinking about Monica?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Yeah  what's that like?
Rachel, Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!  Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh  who would buy this?! 
Monica,  Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Rachel, Hey! What's up?!
Monica, I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh  I need some salt  some margarita mix  and tequila.
Rachel, So all we have is ice?
Monica, See if he has ice.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Oh. Oh! 
Ross, So where are we going next?
Chandler, Sur-surprise him? We're not  we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Joey, Come on man!  Listen so uh  are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
Ross, Yeah  no one talks like that!
Joey, Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Ross, Hey  I'm more cop than you two!
Chandler, How do you figure that?
Ross, Hello! I'm in the front seat  okay? I'm Gary's partner!
Chandler, Y'know  when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It  it sounds gay.
Ross, Umm  jealous! 
Ross, Yeah  no problem. 
Ross, Sorry! Sorry! Oh   there!  Hey Gary  who am I? Phone home!
Chandler, Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Joey, Yeah  what's up with that Serpico?
Monica,  Nooo!
Rachel,  I know!
Monica, Well thank God you were here! I mean  we have to erase that!
Rachel, What?! We can't do that!
Monica, We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling  neurotic  crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Rachel, Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
Monica, I'm his sister  okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?
Rachel, I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Monica, No  look  she's obviously unstable  okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.   Okay  fine! But I mean  look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean  who would do that?!  Okay  fine  all right  but that's y'know  it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Rachel, Ugh!
Monica, Y'know what  this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Rachel, Okay  you are crazy! I'm sorry  but she sounded generally upset! I mean  listen! 
Rachel, Noooooooo!
Chandler, Okay  y'know  we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Ross, What is it?
Chandler,  Oh  hurry up. I want to sign that.
Ross, What? What? What? What is it?
Joey, Is everything okay?
Chandler, What's going on?
Joey,  You okay man?
Ross, Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Chandler, Uh  HELLO!!
Joey, Hi.
Monica, All right  I guess we should go.
Rachel, No  wait. Wait.
Monica, Oh yeah right! 
Rachel, No  Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
Monica, There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Rachel, Yeah well unless we tell him.
Monica, Well  if you're gonna be totally rational about this  I can't argue with you! All right? Fine  if you wanna tell him  tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Rachel, Oh  maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Ross,  Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself  okay? Okay. Oh  and also get stamps. Bye! 
Monica, Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
Rachel, Right?
Phoebe,  John Glenn is here?!
Ross, Pheebs  we had the most incredible night! Okay  so  we're in the car…
Phoebe, Hi!
Ross, Okay  okay  so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Phoebe, My God  Joey!
Chandler,  It was a car backfire!
Ross, Yeah  but-but he didn't know that!
Joey, Yeah  I didn't know that.
Ross, And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Chandler, Who jumps at loud noises!
Ross, Wow! I could've died tonight.
Chandler, Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what  I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. 
Ross, I do have a newfound respect for life.
Chandler,  Oh my God! 
Phoebe, Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh  y'know what? If I heard a shot right now  I'd throw my body on you.
Phoebe, Okay!
Phoebe, Bye!
Joey, Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Joey, Dude! How come you took off?
Chandler, Oh  I just went for a walk  around the living room. Whatever…
Joey, Is something wrong?
Chandler, No. No I'm just tired. Y'know  from-from the walk.
Joey, Okay.
Chandler, You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Joey, That's what this is about! Oh my God  you hate Ross!
Chandler, I do not hate Ross!
Joey, Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Chandler, What picture?
Joey, I don't know  but I don't like what I'm hearing!
Chandler, Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire  but y'know  it could've been a bullet and you y'know  you didn't try to save me!
Joey, Ohh  you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know  I mean Ross  he need help. He's not street like us!
Chandler, When it comes down to it  you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Joey, Well  no  not exactly! All right  look  I  I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was  I was trying to save my sandwich.
Chandler, From a bullet!
Joey, I know it doesn't make much sense…
Chandler, Much sense?!
Joey, Look Chandler  it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
Chandler, So you risked your life  for a sandwich!
Joey, I know it sounds crazy  but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!
Chandler, So you didn't uh  choose Ross before me.
Joey, No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
Chandler, Really?!
Joey, Yeah! In fact  to prove how much you mean to me   here.
Chandler, Thanks. 
Joey, No  eh  oh-oi  easy  it's not a hot dog!
Joey, How good is that?
Chandler,  Oh-oi-ho  yeah!
Joey, See?
Chandler, Hm-hmm. 
Joey, Oh-whoa-hey  dude  what are you doing?!
Chandler, I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Joey, Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!
Rachel, Hey! Hi!
Ross, Rach  what uh  what are you doing here?
Rachel, Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is  this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
Ross, Y'know  it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend  and you're here. Oh! 
Rachel, Okay  just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
Ross, The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
Rachel, What?! What? What happened?!
Ross, Okay  okay  we were on the ride along with Gary  right?
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, And somebody took a shot at me!
Rachel,  Really?!
Ross, No  a car backfired  but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach  I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Rachel, Because a car backfired?
Ross,  Okay  why are you here?
Rachel," Well  I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um  Emily called you today."
Ross, You talked to her?
Rachel, No  she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine.
Ross, Well  okay  what-what did she say?
Rachel, Well  uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh  she wants you to call her.
Ross, Wow!
Rachel, Now  that-that was a good thing that I told you  right?
Ross, Huh? Yeah! Yes  of course!
Rachel, Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry  all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is  I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.   Your decision.
Ross, Right. I guess  I guess I should call Emily.
Rachel, Okay  no  that's not the right decision. That's not  that's not right  no Ross-Ross  come on! I mean  that woman made you miserable! Okay  Ross  do you really want to get back into that?
Ross, Okay  look  yesterday I would've even considered calling her back  but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean  that-that has got to mean something!
Rachel, Ugh  Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
Ross, You weren't there! Okay  maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Rachel, Okay  y'know what? Maybe  this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Ross, Huh.
Rachel, I mean  look-look today you escaped   death  y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
Ross, That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity  but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Rachel, Well  there you go!
Ross, Yeah. Maybe today is just  close call day.
Rachel,  Close call day.
Ross, Hey  thanks Rach. 
Rachel, Ohh  honey no problem. Okay. 
Ross, Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Rachel, Oh?
Ross,"  ""Hey Ross  it's you!""  Oh yeah  no that's-that's an old message  nobody needs to hear that."
Rachel, No. 
Ross,  Hey umm  was-was Monica here?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Yeah  I want my money back.
Rachel,  Yeah  uh you-you probably need that for stamps  right?
Ross, Hey Pheebs  has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Phoebe, Yes. Once. Yeah  a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
Ross, I wonder how I would react under fire  y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire  like I was in a war or something.
Monica, Man  I would be great in a war! I mean  I really  I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
Chandler, Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
Ross, I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Chandler, Yes  if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Joey, Yeah  hero sandwiches. 
Phoebe, Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  But y'know what? When the revolution comes  I will have to destroy you all.   Not you Joey.
Phoebe, I'm fine  thanks.
Chandler,  Yeah  see  I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Monica, No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Phoebe, Nope. 
Monica, So it looks like it's going really well for you two  huh?
Monica,  Oh my God!
Monica, I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?
Monica, I swear  I promise. I promise. Oh my God  I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry  just couldn't resist it.} All right  listen let me tell you  do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know  she cries when they die  and there's the whole funeral…
Phoebe, Okay. Bye!
Phoebe, So  what movie should we see?
Monica,  Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!
Phoebe, What?! Really?!
Monica, He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell  but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
Phoebe, I can't believe this!
Chandler,  Right  because it's fast. Because  it's so fast. It's fast!
Monica, Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!
Chandler, Oh! Good for you Pheebs  way to go! 
Phoebe, No  but it is fast. Isn't it?
Monica, Ohhhh!
Phoebe, No  I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Chandler, So  what are you gonna do?
Phoebe, I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!
Chandler, Me?! Why me?
Phoebe, Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him  make him scared like you! Make him a…man!
Chandler, I'll try  but I'm not sure what good it would do  y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
Monica, That is so sweet! 
Chandler,  Still terrified  I'll take care of it. No problem. 
Joey, Hey Ross  is uh  is Staten Island really an island?
Ross, Uh-huh  that's why they call it Staten Island.
Joey, Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Ross,  Also an island.
Joey, Hey  what time is it?
Ross,  2:17.
Joey, Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball  without dropping it  for like an hour?
Ross, Are you serious?!
Joey, Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Ross, Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey, Oh  I-I  I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah  my pants are a little loose!
Rachel,  Hey  you guys…
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Is Monica here?
Rachel, All right listen umm  I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it  and it's gonna seem a little crazy  but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Ross, You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Rachel, Noo! I wish! Okay  you ready?
Rachel, Okay!  Check it out!
Ross, What-what is it?!
Joey, What the hell is that?!!
Rachel, It's a  it's a cat!
Joey, That  is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}
Rachel, Yes it is!
Ross, Why is it inside out?!
Rachel, Excuse me! But this is a purebred  show-quality Sphinx cat!
Ross, How much did you pay for that?
Rachel, Well  it was a little extravagant  but I a pretty good deal.
Ross, Yeah? How much?
Rachel, A thousand bucks.
Ross, ON A CAT??!!!!
Joey, It's not a cat!
Rachel, All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute  it would sit in my lap and purr all day long  and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Ross, Free cats do that too  y'know. {Which reminds me  if I might get a little political here  support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from  you get a much better deal from the shelter  plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash  go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash  go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
Joey, It's not a cat!
Rachel, Ugh! Look you guys  I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well  what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
Ross,  Hey  you wanna get something to eat or uh  do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Joey, Uhh  the ball thing.
Ross, Yeah?
Joey, Hey Ross  wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!
Ross, Uhh  yeah it would! Let's do it!
Joey, Okay!
Joey,  Uh-oh.
Ross, What?
Joey, I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Joey, Man  I didn't think we were gonna make it!
Ross, I know!  Don't switch hands  okay?
Chandler, Hey ladies! What are you in here for? 
Chandler, Gary  I'm here to report a crime.
Chandler, It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Chandler, Well  I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe  we should have a talk. Man to uh  me.
Chandler, Uh  are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe  you two are gonna be y'know  live-living together!
Chandler, You mean scared.
Chandler, Scared? Happy?
Chandler, I am trying to open your eyes  my man! Don't you see  if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home  she's there. You go to bed  she's there. You wake up and oh yes  she's there!
Chandler, Were you're parents happy  or something?
Chandler, Wow  y'know when you say it  it doesn't sound so scary.
Chandler, Yeah  I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
Chandler,  Yeah  you're right about that.
Ross, …now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!
Joey, Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Monica,  Hey guys!
Joey, Hi!
Monica, Joey  I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here  where is it?
Joey, I don't know.
Monica, All right  come on  I'm-I'm late for work!
Ross, How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Monica, Guys  could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Joey, Oh  I don't know…. Yeah  can't do it.
Monica, What?!
Ross, Monica  whatever you do  do not drop that ball!
Joey, Yeah  we haven't dropped it in… 
Ross, 2 hours  27 minutes.
Monica, Really?!
Monica,  I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today  I don't feel very good.   Yes!!   Wow! Uh  for a second there I thought I was really better  but I'm not. 
Ross, Hey Rach!
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
Rachel, Oh  wow! Congratulations  that's quite a waste of time.
Monica, Rach?
Rachel, Yeah?
Monica, You have scratches all over you  what happened? 
Rachel, Well  it's my cat.
Monica,  What?!
Rachel, Oh yeah  I got a cat.
Monica, I don't want a cat!
Joey, Oh  don't worry  it's not a cat.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel," You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean  it's not sweet  it's not cute  I even dragged that little string on the ground  and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear  I know this sounds crazy  but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying  ""Rachel!"""
Ross, Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
Monica,  What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!
Rachel, Well  I was gonna let you play with it.
Chandler, Hi!
Phoebe, Hmm  did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Chandler, Yes I did  and I think you should do it.
Phoebe, What?!
Chandler, He's a great guy  y'know? And he loves you a lot  you are a very lucky lady.
Phoebe, You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Chandler, I’m sorry.  If you ask me  I'd move in with him.
Phoebe, Ohh!! God!  Ooh!  Get out of here  good for nothing.
Chandler, Hey Gar!
Phoebe, Yeah! Okay. 
Phoebe, Thanks! Okay. 
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Phoebe, No that's not true. If you're not moving forward  you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. 
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Phoebe, I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Phoebe, I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Phoebe, Which is why my answer is yes!
Phoebe, Uh-huh!  I'm so…happy. 
Ross,  Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!
Chandler, Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Joey, That's right baby.
Chandler, All right  let me in. 
Monica,  No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Chandler, What?
Monica, He's a dropper!
Joey, Oh yeah  that's right!
Chandler, I'm not a dropper!
Ross, It's really a uh-uh three person game  y'know?
Chandler, It's throwing and catching!
Ross, All right. 
Chandler, Oh! Oh! That's so hard. 
Joey, Whoa-whoa you guys  it's not a cat!
Monica, Oh my—Oh good God!
Rachel,  I give up you guys  I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Ross, Baking it didn't help  huh?
Monica, So  why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Rachel, I tried! They won't take her back.
Chandler, Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Monica, Rach  why won't they take it back?
Rachel, Well  they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean  what am I going to do  get a thousand regular cats?
Monica, Look  if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Rachel, No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars  I'm all scratched up  and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! 
Monica, Oh my God  the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man  that was close.
Chandler, Yeah  you almost overreacted to something.
Phoebe, We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Phoebe, I know  I'm so excited!
Phoebe, Well  you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Phoebe, Okay  yeah  I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Monica, So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Phoebe, I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus  think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Monica, Why  do you write him a lot?
Phoebe, No  I just heard when people live together  they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Phoebe, Oh  I'm sorry  the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Phoebe, No  nothing.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, No  as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool  I need a pool. 
Phoebe, Uh-huh!
Phoebe,  Yeah  I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
Phoebe, Yeah  uh-huh  there was nothing.  Can I get some water?
Phoebe, Umm  yeah! Today's.
Phoebe,  Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Phoebe, Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!  I'm sorry! 
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, That's so sweet.
Phoebe, Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, No  I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Phoebe, Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! 
Phoebe, Oh wait  one sec. One sec.  Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms   which was never!
Rachel, Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! 
Rachel, It's not a baby! It's a cat!
Rachel, Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!  Yeah  do you want it?
Rachel, Well  so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!
Rachel, Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?
Rachel, Oh  terrific! That'll be $2 000.
Rachel, Okay  a thousand.
Rachel, Well  I do  but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Rachel,  Obviously you know how to haggle  so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind!  Just take cat  leave the money  and run away! Run away!  Damnit!  Cat  can't you at least smile or something?!  Okay  did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
Ross, I'm starving!
Monica, Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
Joey, I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We  invented this game!
Monica, Please! I made this game what it is.
Chandler, Not fun anymore?
Ross, I'm still hungry!
Monica, All right  there's some pizza at my place  we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
Ross, I am!
Monica, All right! Let's go!  Let's go Team Monica!  All right  we can work out the name later.
Monica, Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!
Rachel, It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh  I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Ross, Oh  thank God!
Joey, Did you get your money back?
Rachel, Yeah  15 hundred dollars.
Monica, Wow! You made a profit!
Rachel, Oh yeah  there you go. 
Rachel, Oh good  great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. 
Phoebe, I like waking up with you too.  Oh! It's such a beautiful morning.  Oh  I can stay here all day.
Phoebe, We could have breakfast in bed…
Phoebe, Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
Monica, All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on  look alive!
Phoebe,  Oh good  you're all up.
Rachel, Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
Phoebe, Oh yeah  that's over.
Chandler, Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is  you can work it out!
Phoebe, He shot a bird!
Chandler, Oh that is over!
Rachel, Phoebe  are you okay?
Phoebe, Yeah. Yeah  I'll be alright.
Joey, Oh hey  here Pheebs. 
Phoebe,  Nah  I don't feel like playing. 
Monica, It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean  Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean  only official ballplayers can drop the ball!
Rachel, Phoebe  honey  wanna get some breakfast?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Monica, Okay! Okay  let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! 
Chandler, You guys wanna eat here?
Joey, Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Rachel, Yeah  it is amazing it lasted that long.
Ross, I know. My arm is killing me.
Rachel, No  I meant with the dropper over here. 
Chandler, Y'know  how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. 
Ross, What's going on?
Rachel, Well  my eye is a little itchy.
Joey, Uhhh  mine too! Yeah.
Monica,  Wow! It's really red! You should go see my eye doctor.
Rachel, Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!
Chandler, Oh  Richard. That's all I ever hear  Richard  Richard  Richard!
Monica, Since we've been going out  I think I've mentioned his name twice!
Chandler, Okay  so Richard  Richard!
Monica, It's not Richard! Okay? It's this new guy and he's really good.
Rachel, Well  I'm sorry I'm not going to an eye doctor!
Ross, Oh God  here we go!
Chandler, What?
Ross, Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch! 
Rachel,  Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay  I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Monica, Hey Rach  remember that great song  Me  Myself  and I? 
Rachel,  Monica! Come on!
Ross, Hey  does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I? 
Rachel,  Ross! Stop it! Come on!

Joey, Me too! Me too! Me too! 
Rachel, Just stop it! Come on!
Chandler, You okay there man?
Joey, Yeah  I got too excited!
Ross, All right  I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Phoebe, Ohh  give him a kiss for me!
Ross, All right  bye!
Monica, Bye!
Phoebe, Bye!
Ross, Later! 
Phoebe,  I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Chandler, Wow umm  calm down.
Phoebe, I'm trying  but man that guy can push my buttons!
Monica, Why are so mad at him?
Phoebe, Look  I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?
Monica, Well  it just seems that…
Phoebe, You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?
Chandler, Uh  no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Phoebe," Uh  it's a piece of paper and it says  ""Ross"" on it."
Joey,  Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Chandler, You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Joey," It's called Shutter Speed  it's really cool! Yeah  umm  I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day  right? And then  she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say  ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says  ""Betsy's been dead for 10 years."""
Phoebe, Ohh-oh  chilling!
Joey, And the best part is  we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy!
Chandler, Yeah  I know that means buddy!
Joey, Road trip! Yeah  we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Phoebe, Oh wait  my grandmother's dead.
Chandler, Well  uh  we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Phoebe, No! No  her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Joey, All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa  what are we going to do about my job?
Joey, Oh umm  not go.
Chandler, All right  great  road trip baby!  This okay with you?
Monica, Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission.  You can go.

Monica, No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me  you are wrong! All right  let's go Blinky!  Chandler!!!! 
Phoebe, Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Joey, I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey  you've traveled a lot right?
Phoebe, Yeah  I've been around.
Joey, Okay  so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Phoebe, Ooh  if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay  I must protest this  I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin  on the other hand  might be a different story.}
Joey, Great! Problem solved!
Phoebe, But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Joey, Well  back to square one.
Phoebe, Oh  I know a way that you can decide! All right  I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Joey,  Yes!
Phoebe, Good  but wait. Okay  all right  here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Joey, Peanut butter!
Phoebe, Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Joey, A swimmer!
Phoebe, Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Joey, Monica. Oh… huh  I always thought it would be Rachel.
Phoebe, No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Joey, Ascot!
Phoebe, North route or south route?
Joey, North route!
Phoebe, Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Joey, Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees  here I come!
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe, Oh  this guy again. 
Joey, Hey man  what's up?
Ross, Uhh  not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Joey, Sure  what do you want to see?
Ross, I don't know  umm…
Joey, Oh  I know how we can decide. Phoebe  show him your game!
Phoebe, Umm  no thank you. 
Ross, What's with her?
Joey, I don't know. But hey  I know we can decide. Okay  I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Ross, Okay.
Joey, What do you like better action or comedy?
Ross, Action.
Joey, Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Ross, Dude  you are sick.
Joey, Oh  I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Rachel, Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Monica,  Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Rachel, All right  I'm outta here!
Monica, I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Rachel, Hey!
Rachel, So were done then!
Rachel, Okay.

Rachel, Uh-huh.
Monica, Y'know what  I'm gonna hold her head.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Okay. 
Rachel, Okay. Okay!
Rachel,  Great!! It was very  very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! 
Rachel, Yeah  no  I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Rachel, Great!
Rachel, Okay  just give me the damn drops! 
Monica, Dr. Miller?  P E C F D.
Monica, I sure do!   And you don't get one!
Rachel, Y'know  I-I gotta tell ya  those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Monica, They're still in my coat.
Rachel, Damn!
Chandler,  Hey!
Joey, Hey! You ready to go?
Chandler, Yeah  listen  how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? 
Chandler, What?
Monica, I love you.
Joey, Man  I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Phoebe, Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Chandler, Hey  so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Joey, Uh no  not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Chandler, I see  but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite  right? I mean  lead in a movie  they must be paying you a lot?
Joey, Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes  one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Chandler, So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey," Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
Ross,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me  huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Joey, You got it!
Ross, All right!
Chandler, All right  bye-bye now!
Phoebe, Bye!
Rachel, Bye you guys!
Joey, Bye-bye!
Monica, I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Chandler, Okay!
Joey, Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Rachel, Oh honey  I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Joey, See ya! 
Rachel, Well  wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! 
Ross, Hey Pheebs  what 'cha reading?  Pheebs?  Hello?  Phoebe?  Phoe-Phoebe!  Come on! 
Phoebe, Oh  I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ross, Phoebe  are you  are you mad at me  or something? 'Cause if are please  tell me what it is I did!
Phoebe, Well  if you don't know I can't help you.
Ross, Well  I don't know.
Phoebe, Well  I can't help you.
Ross, Well  whatever it is I'm-I'm very  very sorry. Okay?

Phoebe, I don't know! I don't remember!
Ross, Well if you can't remember  can't we just forget about this?
Phoebe, Oh no  I am mad at you. I know that much. But  I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.
Joey, Man  I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Chandler, We've been driving for a half-hour  and you haven't looked at the road once.
Joey, Don't worry  it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, You wanna eat?  My treat!
Chandler, Isn't that Ross's money?
Joey, Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Chandler, I don't know.
Joey, Ooh  hey  I know how we can decide! All right  uh  I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh  clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Chandler, Okay!
Joey, Okay  uhh  would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Chandler, Too dry.
Joey, Do you believe in ghosts  yes or no?
Chandler, No!
Joey, Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Chandler, No!
Joey,  What?!
Chandler, Yes.
Joey," Dude you said  ""No!"""
Chandler," I also said  ""Yes!"""
Joey, You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Chandler, No!  Ahhh!!!
Joey, I don't believe this!
Chandler, Look Joe  I just  I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Joey, What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Chandler, They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joey, Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Chandler, Joe  I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Joey, Is that why you're on this trip  huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is  I'll tell ya  I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Chandler, Oh  you don't want me on the trip?
Joey, Not if you're gonna be like this!
Chandler, All right  I'll tell ya what  the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Joey, Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Chandler, All right  fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Joey, Fine!  Get out!
Chandler, You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Joey, Get out!!
Chandler, All right!!  Wait! Wait  there's no sidewalk! Yeah  I'm gonna die here.
Ross, Okay  are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Phoebe, No.
Ross, Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe, No that made me feel precious.
Monica, Oh  I know! Umm  is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Ross, Yeah? Sometimes it's… 
Rachel, Oh  did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Ross, Okay  I'm the baby. 
Rachel, Eh! Stop it!
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Chandler, I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know  we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Phoebe, That game should not be played without my supervision.
Chandler, Well  I don't know what mad him so mad  y'know? All I said was that uh  I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break  that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him  and that uh  y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay  he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Phoebe, What's in the bag?
Chandler, Oh  I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Phoebe, I do!
Rachel, Okay. 
Monica, Not even close.
Rachel, Okay  then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Monica, Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Rachel, All right!
Monica, Sit down. 
Rachel, All right.
Monica, Put your head back.
Rachel, Yes!
Monica, All right.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Now  open your eyes.
Rachel, Okay  they are. 
Monica, How many fingers am I holding up? 
Rachel,  Four.
Monica, Oh my God  I was thinking four.
Rachel, Really?!
Monica, Yes! All right  y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Rachel, Okay!
Monica, No drops!
Rachel, Great!
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, On three  1…2…3!  Now my pillow's all wet! 
Rachel, Well  well  you said it was practice!
Monica, Then why did you move?!
Rachel, Because I knew you were lying!
Monica, All right  come here! 
Rachel,  What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! 
Monica, I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!  I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes. 
Rachel, Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Rachel, Monica! Stop it!
Monica,  Damn! It's empty!
Rachel, Wow  y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now  we could make a fortune! 
Phoebe, Ooh that is definitely Chandler  Joey  or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!
Monica,  Hello?   It's Joey.   I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Joey,  Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Monica, What did you do to his sweater vests?
Joey, Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Monica, Yeah  she's here. Hold on a second. 
Phoebe, Hey  dude!
Joey, Hey Pheebs! Listen  this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Phoebe, Oh that's my grandma.  And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. 
Chandler,  Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Phoebe, Okay Joey? Chandler's here  he was wondering…  Okay  I guess he ran out of change.
Chandler, Y'know  he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Monica, Well  maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Chandler, That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn…
Phoebe, No  don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Chandler, Really?
Phoebe, Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Ross,  Okay Pheebs  I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay  clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Ross, What do you like better flora or fauna?
Phoebe, Fauna.
Ross, Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Phoebe, Garfunkle.
Ross, Why are you mad at me?
Phoebe, You said I was boring--Ohh!
Ross, When did I say you were boring?!
Phoebe, Oh my God  I remember now! We were playing chess!
Ross, Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Phoebe, Oh  come on! Yes  remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess  you said I was boring  and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!  Okay  there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Joey, Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Joey, Wh-what?! Why?!
Joey,  You're kidding right?
Joey, What?!
Joey, Uh  hang out?! How long?
Joey, No!
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Thanks.   Congratulations on your big break.
Monica,  Hello?
Joey,  Hey Monica  it's Joey!
Monica, Hey Joey! Aww  you remembered even though you're a big star!
Joey, Aw  come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Monica, Joey  what's it like on a movie set  huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Joey, Uh  well yeah-yeah  I've got all of that going on. Yeah  listen uh  I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica  my uh  my sushi's here!
Joey,  Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
Joey, Everybody smile!  Okay  thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific!  Kill me. Kill me now.
Ross, Hey Rach  can you pass me the TV Guide?
Rachel, Yep!
Monica, Go!!
Rachel, What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!
Monica, Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.
Rachel, Oh! 
Rachel, Pheebs? Could you get that? Please?
Phoebe, Why? Just 'cause you're too lazy to get up off your touchie?
Rachel, No! No! It's just that all the people in the entire world that I want to talk to are right here.
Phoebe,  Okay! 
Rachel,  Sucker!
Phoebe,  Hello?  Hey Joey!
Joey, Hey Pheebs! Listen  uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can  can you get it for me?
Phoebe, Sure! Where is it?
Joey, Uh  I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.
Phoebe, Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Joey, That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler,  Hey!
Phoebe,  Ooh  do you want to talk to Chandler?
Chandler,  Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him!
Joey, No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
Phoebe, Who was that?
Joey, Uhh  my stunt double. Yeah  and y'know  he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Chandler,  Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone  I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Joey, Uhh Pheebs  I heard that. Can you put him on?
Phoebe, Yeah! 
Chandler,  Hey!
Joey, Don't come out here!
Chandler, No-no-no-no  I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
Joey, I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
Chandler, Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Joey, Well  I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!
Chandler, Uh  what was that?
Joey, Uh  Entertainment Tonight.  Yeah  okay so  good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. 
Phoebe, Monica! I'm sorry I'm late!  Monica? 
Monica,  Phoebe?  Oh  Phoebe  I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
Phoebe,  It's okay. What the hell took you so long?
Monica, Okay  you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Phoebe, Which Richard?
Monica, The Richard.
Phoebe, Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!
Monica, Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy  moustache?
Phoebe, Oh! Okay  that actually makes more sense. So how was it?
Monica, It was  it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
Phoebe, That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Monica, Really?
Phoebe, But again  Simmons. Go on.
Monica, The strange part was  he was really nice  umm and he looks great  but I didn't feel anything at all!
Phoebe, Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Monica, Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Phoebe, Oh  I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Monica, I know.
Phoebe, Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, On a totally different bet.
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, It's almost our anniversary!
Chandler, I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Phoebe, Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Chandler, Huh.
Monica, I got you a present!
Chandler, Oh  but it's not 'til tomorrow!
Monica, I know  but you have to open it today! 
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!
Chandler, Wow!
Monica, For this weekend! Oh gosh  it would be perfect  we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.
Chandler, Do we have to?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Okay this is great  but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Monica, Oh  he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own  ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Chandler, Yeah  I think we should see other people.
Monica, But we can go  right?
Chandler, Yes.
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, It's a great idea. 
Phoebe, Okay  I'm gonna go too!
Chandler, Y'know Pheebs  it's kinda our  anniversary.
Phoebe, Oh please  you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Monica, Ditch you? Phoebe  you were pregnant with the triplets!
Phoebe, Uh-huh  great story! I'm going!
Rachel,  Hi!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey  you guys  listen  this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!
Rachel, Well  I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Phoebe, Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!
Rachel, Oh no  wait a minute  wait  I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Ross, Oh  but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Chandler,  Art lover!
Ross, What'd you say?
Chandler, I said art lover.
Ross, Is that supposed to be an insult?
Chandler, I don't know  I'm very tired.
Ross, So Rach  maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Rachel, That sounds great.
Ross, Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. 
Rachel, Okay. Yeah  that would be nice actually  to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  so you can walk around naked.
Rachel, No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Phoebe, Naked alone time.
Rachel, No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean  you live alone  you don't walk around naked.
Phoebe, Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?
Phoebe, So  so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
Chandler, So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Phoebe, Okay  what about after I give you these candies? 
Chandler, Yeah  I guess it's a little better now.
Phoebe, Ah-ha! Okay   Las Vegas 1  London 0! I'll be right back. 
Chandler,  Happy plane-aversary.
Monica, Aww! I love you!
Chandler, Can I give you a present now?
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, Okay!  Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!
Monica," I love the ""I forgot the present"" fake out!"
Chandler," How do you feel about the  ""I really did forgot the present  please forgive me"" not fake out?"
Monica, Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it  you can give it to me when we get back.
Chandler, Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Phoebe,  Oh good! All right  so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Chandler, What-what Richard thing?
Phoebe, Oh no. 
Chandler, What Richard thing?
Phoebe,  Simmons! Go with Simmons!
Monica, Okay  I umm  I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Chandler,  I'm not mad.
Monica, Really?!
Chandler, Oh yeah! Yeah  so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. 
Monica, Great!
Phoebe, Okay  London 1…
Rachel,  Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys  we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.}  Huh  check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange.  I'm naked!  Lighting the candles  naked  and carefully. 
Ross,  Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this.  Okay  vivid colors  expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho  Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or  am I?
Rachel,  Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow!  Love to love ya  baby!  Darnit!  Ugh. 
Ross, Hey.
Ross, May I come in?
Rachel, Uh  yeah  if you want too.
Ross, Do you want me too?
Rachel, Yeah  sure?
Ross," So do I.  Okay Rach  before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.  This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us.""  Okay? I just want this to be  about what it is! "
Rachel, And um  what-what is that Ross?
Ross, The physical act of love. 
Rachel,  What?! Are you crazy?
Ross, Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?
Rachel,  Oh God  you saw me?! Oh!
Ross, You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.
Rachel, Noo!! No! You thought  you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
Ross, No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no. 
Rachel, Ohh wow! I’m sorry  but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Ross, Can we  can we just forget this ever happened?
Rachel, Yes of course  absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Ross, Thank you.
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, All right I guess I'm  gonna go pack. 
Rachel," Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm  do-do we still need to uh settle the question of ""us?"""
Phoebe, Hey you guys wait! Guys!  This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon  99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!
Monica, Phoebe  you don't eat animals.
Phoebe, For 99 cents  I'd eat you.  Okay  I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want  including Joey! Look!  Oh! Look! Hi!
Chandler, Oh my God.
Phoebe, Hey! Joey!  Hey! Hey!! Wow! 
Joey, Hi!
Chandler, Love your condoms my man.
Joey, What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Phoebe, Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Joey, Uhh  because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah  I uh  I play a gladiator. Uh  y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah  my-my friends are here  I'm gonna take a little break.
Monica, Who are you talking too?
Joey, They uh director. Uhh  her.  All right  all right  it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Chandler, Why?! What happened?!
Joey, Well  the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money  so I'm working here 'til it starts up again  if it ever does.
Monica, I'm so sorry.
Joey, Look  I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.
Chandler, No-no  that's okay  apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Monica, I knew you were not okay with that.
Phoebe, So you're a gladiator! Wow!
Joey, Yeah  what-what's going on?
Phoebe, Monica had lunch with Richard.
Joey, Dawson?!
Phoebe, Noo! But that would've been so cool!
Chandler, No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Monica, It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time  how can you not trust me?
Chandler, When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Monica, You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Chandler, Thanks. 
Joey, Aww  there we go.
Phoebe, I love Vegas!
Monica, I promise you  next time I will absolutely tell you.
Chandler,  Next time?
Joey, Ooh  so close.
Chandler, There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
Monica, I can not see him? I mean  you can't tell me what to do!
Chandler, That's so funny  because I think I just did!
Monica, Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night  I really  I don't even want to be around you.
Chandler, Fine with me!
Monica, Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Joey, Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Monica, No it is not!
Chandler, What are you talking…
Joey, Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! 
Rachel,  Okay umm  Ross? I'm-I'm really warm  so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now  I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Ross,  Yep! That's hilarious!
Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
Ross, Y'know  last night was embarrassing for you too.
Rachel, No  not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.
Ross, Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Rachel, Okay. All right  that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.
Ross, What?! You totally get embarrassed!
Rachel, No  I don't! Ross  I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Ross, Is that so?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross,  Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! 
Joey, Hey  y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.
Chandler, Really?
Joey, Yeah  sure! Sure! They would uh  they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…
Chandler,  Joey  I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
Joey, All right well  I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.
Chandler, Whoa!
Joey, Yeah-yeah  he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5 000. Can you believe that? $5 000!
Chandler, Y'know  if I won $5 000 I'd join a gym  y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! 
Joey, Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5 000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Chandler, Good luck!
Joey, Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
Chandler, I see.
Monica,  Thank you.
Phoebe, Thanks.
Monica, I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Phoebe, Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am so sorry.
Monica, This is crazy! I mean  it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
Phoebe, So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Monica, Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you! 
Phoebe, Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas  number one!
Monica, Anybody lose this? 
Monica, Hmm.
Rachel, Yeah  all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
Rachel, Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just  I think he just really likes you.
Ross,  Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student? 
Ross, What the? What…
Rachel,  Hi!
Rachel, Yes  I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm  my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Joey,  Can I change a hundred? 
Joey,  Let's ride.
Joey, Hit me!  Ohh man!  Wait! 
Joey, Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
Chandler,  What?
Joey, My identical hand twin!
Chandler, What's an identical hand twin?
Joey, What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler  the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Chandler, Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
Joey, Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Chandler,  How?
Joey, Look  I don't have it all worked out yet  but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!
Chandler, Again I must go back to  how?
Joey, This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay  how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh?
Chandler,  Y'know  I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Joey, Hey  are you unsupporting me again?
Chandler, No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't  I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Pheebs!!
Phoebe, Yeah?
Joey, I found my identical hand twin!
Phoebe, Ohh  you are so lucky!  Hey! So  where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Chandler, No!
Phoebe, But she just came up here!
Chandler, That was Joey!
Phoebe, I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Chandler, Yeah  well  she's probably talking to Richard.
Phoebe, Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
Chandler, Really?
Phoebe, Yes! Now  she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Chandler, Okay. 
Phoebe, Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
Rachel, Yes  I did. Thank you very much  it was excellent. 
Ross, Ohh  it was the best!
Ross, I think the check in is that way. 
Rachel, Ahh.
Rachel, Hello!  Ohh  kids love me.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Ross, Phoebe! 
Phoebe, You guys are here! Yay!
Rachel, Hi! 
Phoebe,  What? Did you go to a costume party? Let me guess umm Pancho Vila?  and you're Bob Saget. 
Rachel, Pancho Vila?
Phoebe, Yeah! 
Rachel, What are you talking about Pheebs?  I don't…   Oh my God  you drew on me?!
Ross, Hey  you wet my pants!
Phoebe, Whoa  what kind of party was this?
Rachel, Ross  I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line. 
Ross, Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way. 
Phoebe, Ugh!
Ross, What?
Phoebe, That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Ross, Oooohhh  I'll bet she's one of those people.
Phoebe, M-M-Mole people?
Ross, What? No-no  a lurker.
Phoebe, Oh. What's a lurker?
Ross, Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out  a lurker waits for you to give up and then…
Phoebe, Kills you?
Ross, No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Phoebe, Ohhh!
Ross, Uh-hmm.
Phoebe, How do you know about this?
Ross, My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.
Phoebe, Dance karate?
Ross, Yes  it's a deadly but beautiful sport. 
Rachel,  All right  it won't come off!
Ross, What?!
Rachel, It won't come off!
Ross, Oh my God! Rach-Rach  are-are-are you sure?
Rachel, No  actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Joey,  Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Ross, Joey!!
Joey, All right! Hey-hey!
Rachel, Hi!!
Joey, Who's your friend? He's hot! 
Ross,  Thanks man.
Rachel, Hi. 
Ross, Hey listen I uh  talked to Chandler  sorry about the movie.
Joey, No  don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Ross, Your what?
Joey, My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
Ross, What?! That's not gonna make you any money!
Joey, Okay. Well  if that's how you feel about it  fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh  you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
Monica, All right baby  come on!  Yes! Yes! I am on fire!
Chandler,  See you later Mon.
Monica, Wait Chandler  what are you doing?!
Chandler, What does it look like? I'm going home.
Monica, What? Wait! Why?  Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry  I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that  look if you don't want me to see Richard again  I won't! He means nothing to me!
Chandler, Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.
Monica, Not any more.
Chandler, Really?!
Monica, Really!  All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary.  Okay  this is empty.
Chandler, Yeah  I wanted to make a dramatic scene  but I hate packing.
Joey,  Uhh  hey. Where's the other guy?
Joey, He's kinda tall  dark hair  hand looks exactly like this.  See?
Joey, Okay!  How you doin'?
Joey, Right! Okay. 
Ross,  Yes  hello. I have a question. Umm  I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.  A beard and a moustache.  Thank you.  No  she didn't think so.  I know it's like  anyway  umm well make-up didn't cover it and we've tried everything to get it off and nothing's worked. What-what do we do?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Oh! Okay.  Okay  thank you!   Yeah  it's not coming off.
Rachel, What?! What else did he say?
Ross, Umm  he said he thought I was funny. So… Okay  look-look umm  let's just go downstairs  we'll have some fun  and you will forget all about it.
Rachel, Ross  no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Ross, Oh  come on! Rach  it's-it's not that bad.
Rachel, Ross  I am a human doodle!!
Ross, Look  just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides  hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello! There are tons of other freaks here!  There are tons…of…freaks here. No other. No. Come on! No one will notice  I swear!
Ross, Okay  there was some staring and pointing.
Rachel, Okay  I need a  I need a drink! 
Ross, Oh  hey y'know  they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  But who cares?! Because it's all on me!   That is  one big drink!
Rachel,  Macadamia nut?
Ross,  Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!
Rachel, Hm-mmm! 
Ross, Really like those Macadamia nuts  huh?
Rachel, Nope! 
Phoebe,  Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get! 
Chandler,  Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, Ohh! You made up!
Monica, Yeah  I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Chandler, Yeah  she couldn't live without the Chan Love. 
Phoebe, Ohh  get a room.
Monica, We have one.
Phoebe, I know. Use it.
Joey, Oh-oh-oh  yeah!  That's right  you take good care of those babies!
Joey, It's me  Joey!
Joey,  Joey!
Joey, Okay  so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!
Joey, Look  you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like  hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!
Joey,  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us!  This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait  that's your hand! No wait  it's my hand!
Joey,  But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Rachel, Oh my God  I'm starting to look like my great aunt  Muriel.
Ross,  All right. Y'know what? We don’t have to go downstairs! We can bring Vegas up to us!  All right  come on  come on  we'll play some blackjack. Here we go.  13.
Rachel, Hit me!
Ross,  Oohh  23.  Which is what we play to at this casino! You win 10 dollars!

Joey, Hit me! 
Phoebe, Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now  I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Joey, Uhh  Ms. Phalange  may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?

Chandler, Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
Phoebe,  Hey! Don’t you give me any of your—Hey! 
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, What are you guys doing here?
Joey, Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?
Chandler, Yes! Well that-yes.
Monica, Why else would we be here?
Joey, Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
Chandler, We actually missed it.
Phoebe, Well  maybe you wouldn’t have had you  run in the chapel!
Monica, This is insane!
Phoebe, What’s the big deal  y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.
Chandler, What?!
Phoebe, Yeah  if you get married in Vegas  you’re only married in Vegas.
Monica, What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
Phoebe,  Really?!
Monica, Yeah!
Phoebe, Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
Rachel, Ohhh! 
Ross, Why are we in bed together?
Rachel, I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
Ross,  Yeah.
Rachel, Really?!
Ross, No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh  did we? I mean  I don’t remember much about last night  it was such a blur.
Rachel, Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
Ross, And we didn’t have sex.
Rachel, Ohh  I mean  we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.
Ross,  Tell me about it. 
Joey, Mornin’ Pheebs.  Well  my movie has officially been canceled.
Phoebe, Oh Joey  I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Joey, Nah  I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys  what time’s your flight?
Phoebe, What about my cab?
Joey, I don’t need that anymore.
Phoebe, No  Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
Joey, I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself  I get so lonely.  Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?
Phoebe, I don’t know  it’s such a long trip.
Joey, It’ll be great! We-we could talk  and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
Phoebe, Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Joey, Sure?
Phoebe, All right. Although I don’t think we need one  I never stopped loving you.
Chandler, Hi!
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, So  has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Phoebe, Um-hmm  yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Joey, Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!
Chandler, It’s a buffet man.
Joey, Oh  here’s where I win all my money back! 
Chandler, Listen  I gotta talk to you.
Joey, Sure! What’s up? 
Chandler, Monica and I almost got married last night.
Joey," Oh my God! That’s huge!  Wait a minute  why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say  ""Ross."" Do not say  ""Ross."""
Chandler, Look  I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean  I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a  like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And  how do I tell her without crushing her?
Joey, Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me  if she’s anything like me  she’s just gonna be relieved.
Monica, How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart  he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
Phoebe, Well you don’t.
Monica, Yes I do!
Phoebe, Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Chandler,  Hi.
Monica, Oh hi! Hi! Y’know  we were just talking about bacon.
Phoebe, No  we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, What?
Chandler, Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
Rachel,  I don’t know.  What do you mean last night? Nothing  nothing uh  happened last night.
Ross, Yeah!
Phoebe, Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Monica, Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!
Rachel,  Who got married?! 
Chandler,  You did.
Ross, What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
Rachel, No  we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
Ross, We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
Rachel, Oh my God.
Ross, I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Rachel, No!
Joey, They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Phoebe, Hell  I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
Monica, What are you guys gonna do?
Rachel, Well  I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? 
Chandler, Well  I think  I think  Ross already has one. Now  this one’s free  right? Because you paid for the first two  so the third one’s free.
Ross, Laugh it up  but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced  okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.
Joey, An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
Phoebe, Oh-oh  that’s your thing.
Ross, What?
Phoebe, You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
Ross, No-no  that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
Phoebe, Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it  divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.
Monica, So  what do you think we should do?
Chandler, I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
Monica, I know I love you! 
Chandler, So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Monica, That’s a good question. Look umm  last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Chandler, Yes  we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay  so say uh  say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
Monica, All right  eight we get married  but 2  3  4  5  6  7  9  10  11  12 we don’t get married.
Chandler, Sounds great.
Monica, Okay. 
Monica, Ready?
Chandler, Ready!
Monica,  Come on eight.
Chandler,  Yes  yes eight.
Monica, Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.
Chandler, That was so unlikely. Well  let’s get married! I guess.
Monica, Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
Chandler, That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight  no wedding! Damnit!
Monica, I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?
Chandler, Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing  right?
Monica, Ohh  of course we are!  We left it up to fate.  If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. 
Phoebe, Okay  you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any  QUESTIONS!!!
Joey,  What?!
Phoebe, Well  you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment  you greedy sleeper!
Joey, All right. All right.
Phoebe, Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
Joey, Really? I don’t…
Phoebe, Sing!!
Joey,  I wanna rock and roll all night! 
Joey,  Man  this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! 
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  hubby!
Ross, Yeah. Yeah  actually um  I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Ross, I’m not going to do that. 
Rachel, Okay! So  we’ll just stay married.
Ross, Yes  exactly!
Rachel, And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Ross, Wow! This is so amazing. I uh  I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
Rachel, Okay  see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.
Ross, I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I  I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
Rachel, What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!
Ross, Okay  look  how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
Rachel, Ohh  okay  I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married  because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right  look  just please  take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.
Ross, I’m asking you to do me a favor.
Rachel, You are asking me to be your wife!
Ross, And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Monica, That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
Chandler, Well you did pull his hair.
Monica, He took my snack!
Chandler, I’m not getting into this again!
Monica, Okay! Oh God  y’know what? It’s really bad.
Chandler,  Well  I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay. 
Monica, This doesn’t mean anything  does it?
Chandler, No!
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe,  How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—  a rapist or a killer or something!
Joey, Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Phoebe, Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you  are you a rapist?!
Phoebe, Do you like car games?
Phoebe, I love the license plate game!
Joey, Ooh  I’ll play! I’ll play!
Phoebe, No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! 
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, Listen  I know you wanted to talk to me  but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register  and you get to keep all the presents!
Rachel,  No! Ross  come on! No! Listen  look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line  Ross  is we can not stay married.
Ross, I don’t know if it’s true.
Rachel, Oh b-b-but it is!
Ross, Oh  okay  y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
Rachel, Oh Ross  come on! This is not  this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross  listen  if you do not get this annulment  I will!
Ross, All right. All right  I’ll do it.
Rachel, Thank you.  Hey-hey umm  uh  is there  is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Phoebe, Oh  okay.
Phoebe, And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter  so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
Joey, Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown  engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Phoebe, Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!
Joey, Pheebs  I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So  so  so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
Phoebe, You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Joey, Well  thank you. So  can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.
Phoebe, Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
Joey, Yes.
Phoebe, Is it a meatball sub?
Joey, That is incredible! You are the master!
Rachel, Huh  that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…
Monica, No  don’t say it! Don’t even think it!
Rachel, All right. Okay Chandler  enjoy your handful. 
Chandler, All right  should we just  should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Monica, I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast  I’m happy the way things are!
Chandler, Me too!
Monica, I don’t want things to change! Do you?
Chandler, No!
Monica, All right then  then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!
Chandler, Jeez  relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! 
Chandler,  Y’know I was thinking  what if I uh  unpack here?
Monica, Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler, Well  what if all my stuff was here?
Monica, Then you’d be going back and forth all the time  I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
Chandler, Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
Monica, Live together? There have been no signs for that.
Chandler, Me asking is kind of a sign.
Monica, YES!!!!!!!!
Chandler, Okay!!!!!
Monica, Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Here’s your key 
Chandler, Oh thanks.
Monica, Here’s your key. All right  you have to christen it! Now  go out and come back in!
Chandler, The door hasn’t been locked in five years  but okay!  Ready?!
Monica, Ready!
Chandler, Okay  a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!
Monica, Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!
Chandler, This is not a sign!
Monica, No  it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!
Chandler, It’s an old key!
Monica, Oh my God it’s old!
Chandler, I love you!
Monica, I love you!
Chandler, Are you hugging the door right now.
Monica, No.
Chandler, Yeah-yeah  me neither.
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Ross, Oh  yeah  no problems. It’s all taken care of.
Rachel, Ross  thank you. Hey  do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross, Oh yeah  why not?
Rachel, Pheebs?
Phoebe, No thanks  I’ve already seen one.
Rachel, Okay  umm  I’m gonna get my sweater. 
Ross, Okay.  You uh  you wanna hear something weird?
Phoebe, Always.
Ross, I didn’t get the annulment.
Phoebe, What?!
Ross, We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. 
Joey, What are you doing?
Chandler, The key’s stuck in the lock.
Joey, I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out. 
Chandler,  It still doesn’t work.
Joey, I’m not finished.
Chandler, Oh.
Chandler, Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Ross, Oh  yeah  no problems. It’s all taken care of.
Rachel, Ross  thank you. Hey  do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Ross, Oh yeah  why not?

Phoebe, What?!
Ross, We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. 
Ross,  Hey  do you have any gum?
Rachel, Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Phoebe,  Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen  Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Rachel, Oh but Phoebe  we’re gonna be late for the movie.
Phoebe, Oh  there’s a cab! Taxi!!  Good timing  my God  huh? Here you go. 
Rachel, Yeah  we’re  we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.
Phoebe, Oh  the Angelica!! Go! Go!   You didn’t get the annulment?!!
Ross, I know.
Phoebe, Ross?!
Ross," Well  I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was  ""Three divorces. Three divorces!"" Look  I just don’t want my tombstone to read  Ross Gellar  Three Divorces."
Phoebe, Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say  Ross Geller  Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay  Buried Alive.
Ross, Look  all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!
Phoebe, So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op  woman! Sorry.
Ross, Well  okay so  I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel  please?
Phoebe, Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although  being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Rachel,  Okay  stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Phoebe, Hey Rach!
Rachel, What was that?!
Phoebe, Sorry  mix up. Hey  how was the movie?
Rachel, I haven’t seen it yet!
Phoebe, Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go! 
Rachel, Noooooooo!!
Chandler, Y’know when we move in together  can I get a gumball machine?
Monica, Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
Chandler, No. When it comes to sweets  he’s surprisingly strict.
Monica, Hey  have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?
Chandler," No  no  I keep trying  y’know? I can get out  ""Joey  I have too…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with  ""…go to the bathroom."" He may think I’m sick."
Monica, Y’know  I really have to tell Rachel  but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know  the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.
Chandler, Oh  so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
Monica, Pretty much.
Chandler, All right.
Joey,  Hey Monica!
Monica, Hi!
Joey,  Hey man  you feeling any better?

Joey, Wow!  Well  uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations!  See you later. 
Monica, Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
Joey, Yeah  I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like you’d believe that. This sucks!
Chandler, Look  I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you  the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!
Joey,  Okay! Look-look-look  uh  if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh  forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always  he always umm—Oh  who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! 
Monica, Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey  have you seen Rachel?
Phoebe, No  why?
Monica, I have some pretty exciting news!
Phoebe,  You’re pregnant!
Monica, No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
Phoebe, Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant  what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
Ross, Hey! Hi!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, What’s up?
Monica, Well umm  Chandler and I are moving in together.
Ross, Oh my God. Ohh  my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh  that’s great. That’s great. 
Phoebe, Guys  I’m happy too.
Monica, Okay  come here! 
Phoebe, Wow! Big day huh? People moving in  people getting annulled… 
Monica, Okay  I gotta go find Rachel but umm  if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? 
Ross, Bye.
Phoebe, Hmm  something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel  what could that be?!
Ross, Could ya just  could ya just lay off  please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
Phoebe, Ross  it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times  you’ll still have a life  you’ll go on dates…
Ross,  No! No  I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh  Murderer Guy  and-and  Geologists.
Phoebe, Ross  you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Ross, Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Phoebe, Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross  nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here  I’ll show you! Come here.
Ross, What?! Why?
Phoebe,  Hi! Hi! Listen  my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time  but wouldn’t you date him?
Ross, And if you wait right here  I’ll go get Ross. 
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Ugh  I thought you were Rachel!
Chandler,  What gave me away?
Monica, I just tell her  I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!
Chandler, Okay  so that’s it  everybody knows! It’s official  we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.
Rachel, Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, Ugh  the worse day! Y’know  you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Chandler, Hey listen  for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.
Rachel, I believe you. So  it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day  the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Chandler, Well  I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…
Rachel, What?
Chandler,  All yours babe. 
Monica, Have a seat.  Okay  listen umm  Chandler and I are going to live together  here.
Rachel, Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!
Monica, Really?!
Rachel, And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God  the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Monica, Yes  we are. 
Rachel, And Chandler  you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.
Chandler, Rach…
Monica, Yeah  he’s gonna work on that.
Rachel, Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God…  Come and knock on my door…
Monica,  We’ll be waiting for you…
Ross, …once you know the stories  it’s not that bad. First marriage  wife’s hidden sexuality  not my fault. Second marriage  said the wrong name at the altar  a little my fault. Third marriage  well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face  Nevada’s fault.
Phoebe, Okay  so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
Phoebe, Okay  what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?
Phoebe,  Whatever! What about you Meg?
Ross, What?!
Phoebe,"  She said  ""He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."" "
Ross, This is crazy! I mean  yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past  but now  she is just my wife! Phoebe  will you-will you help me out here?
Phoebe, Well  I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Ross, We were drunk! I would’ve married uh  Joey with that amount of alcohol!
Phoebe, Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Ross,  Look  I’m sorry  but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.
Phoebe," Yes  and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say  ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg."
Ross,  Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think  forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay  I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth——Nothing!!
Chandler, Okay  when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Monica, Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her  she’s my best friend!
Chandler, Well  Joey’s my best friend.
Monica, I’m not your best friend?
Chandler, You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
Monica, All right  all right  at least I’m prepared.
Chandler, Okay.  Oh yes. 
Monica,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey-hey!
Monica, These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
Chandler, I am now!
Rachel,  Hey roomie!
Chandler, Okay  bye! 
Monica, Rach  there’s something uh  important I have to tell you.
Rachel,  Are you pregnant?!
Monica, No! But  I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Rachel, Um-hmm.
Monica, Umm  when I said that uh  that Chandler and I wanted to umm  live together we meant alone together.
Rachel,  Oh my God! Oh  that’s funny  I can’t believe I did that.
Monica, Oh no sweetie  no! This is my fault  I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen  you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.
Rachel, Okay. 
Monica, Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?
Rachel, Sure?  Thanks.
Monica, Maybe  do you need a tissue?
Rachel, Monica  where did you get these?!
Monica, I made them!
Rachel, Ooh  good God  they’re so yummy! 
Joey," God  it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?"" ""Can’t  its not there."""
Chandler, Look  I’m just gonna be across the hall  we can still do all the same stuff.
Joey, Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
Chandler, Not once did we do that.
Monica,  Hi.
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hi.
Monica, So I  I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Chandler, Oh yeah? Well  how’d she take it?
Monica, Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah  she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad. 
Chandler, And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
Monica, I mean  all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey  he cried his eyes out!
Joey, Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!
Chandler, Okay  I gotta ask  who calls us that?!
Ross, Yes.
Ross, Yes  second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, Basically  Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
Ross, Yes-yes-yes! But  I-I do not love her.
Ross, This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Ross, I think just the annulment for today.
Ross, Easy.
Ross, No problem.
Ross, Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh  it was  it was already taken care of.
Ross, Uh-ha  what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, Hey. So um  I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Rachel, Okay!
Monica, Y’know  no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Hey Rach  what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See  I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know  too many memories!
Rachel,  What the hell is that?
Monica, I don’t know.  Hey  Rachel  you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Rachel, Wow! Mon  thanks! I love this plate!
Monica, Something to remember me by!
Rachel, Mon  honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know  I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.
Monica, But still  it’s a big change. The end of an era  you might say!
Rachel, Are you okay? You’re not blinking.
Monica, I’m fine! I just  I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.
Rachel, Oh  all right. But y’know I gotta say  I don’t  I don’t think six years counts as an era.
Monica, An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now  it was significant to me  maybe it wasn’t significant to you!
Rachel, What is the matter with you?!
Monica, What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!
Rachel, All right  fine  but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.
Monica, What’s hard to believe?
Rachel, Well y’know  it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean  you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.
Monica, Rachel  it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
Rachel, But I…
Monica, No-no  wait! Just let me finish  okay? This isn’t something that we just  we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas  this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
Rachel, It is? Really?
Monica, Yeah  sweetie.
Rachel,  I mean we’re not  we’re not gonna live together anymore?
Monica, No.
Rachel, What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much! 
Monica, I’m gonna miss you! 
Rachel, I mean it’s the end of an era!
Monica, I know!
Phoebe,  Okay  bye!
Ross, Oh no.
Phoebe, So? Did you get the annulment?
Ross, I couldn’t.
Phoebe, I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Ross, It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
Phoebe, Yeah  complicated ‘cause of the love.
Ross, I… I do  I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
Phoebe, I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.
Ross, I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! 
Ross, Ohh  what’s wrong?!
Rachel, Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Ross, Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.
Rachel, Thank you.
Ross, Of course.
Joey, So  Ross and Rachel got married  Monica and Chandler almost got married  do you think you and I should hook up?
Phoebe, Oh we do  but not just yet.
Joey, Really?! Well  when?
Phoebe, Okay umm  well  first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
Joey, Wow.
Phoebe, I know. Then  I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Joey, Great!
Phoebe, But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
Joey, Oh-oh  what about Ross?
Phoebe, I don’t want to go into the whole thing  but umm  we have words and I kill him.
Chandler,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Joey,  Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
Rachel,  Pheebs  I wanna ask you something.
Phoebe, Uh-huh  what?
Rachel, Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…
Phoebe, Oh!
Rachel, …how about I move in with you?
Phoebe, Well  that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Monica, Who’s Denise?
Phoebe, My roommate.
Rachel, You have a roommate?!
Phoebe, Yes  Denise. Denise!
Joey, Hey  what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise  is she cute?
Chandler, Pheebs  I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Phoebe, Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Joey, Hey Rach  listen I was thinkin’ uh  I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…
Rachel, Oh  that’s true.
Joey, Yeah  why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late  watch movies  and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?
Rachel, Yeah  yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
Chandler, Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday’s was just our thing man!
Phoebe, Hey.
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, So  what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ross, Oh  that. Umm  she took it really well.
Phoebe, You didn’t tell her did you?
Ross, No.
Phoebe, Of course not  because you’re in love with her.
Ross, I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh  didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her  as a friend.
Phoebe, What do you mean  comforted her?
Ross, It’s nothing  I just gave her a hug.
Phoebe, Ah-ha! A classic sign of love  the hug!
Ross, It’s also a sign of friendship.
Phoebe, Yeah  not in your case Lovey Loverson. 
Ross,  It was a hug!
Phoebe, Okay  just tell me this  did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ross, S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Phoebe, Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why  that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross  you’re a scientist.
Ross, I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face  she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh  that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Phoebe,  Okay  whatever you say. But just be careful  all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.
Ross,  If the place you are referring too is being in love  then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Phoebe, Okay  I didn’t understand that  but y’know  maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love!
Joey, Hey!  Dude  some guy just called for you.
Chandler, Who was it?
Joey," I don’t know! How about  ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez! "
Monica, Okay listen  y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty  you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Chandler, Sure!
Monica, Okay  I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room  right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay  whatever  I really haven’t thought about it that much.
Chandler, Well  I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room  y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh  like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200  the real ones! The big-big ones!
Monica, No.
Chandler," Okay so you mean no as in  ""Gee Chandler  what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
Monica, Oh  I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea  umm  talk about it  but no.
Chandler, So  that’s it?
Monica, I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
Chandler, Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
Monica, What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Chandler, I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room  especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Monica, Are you mocking me?
Chandler, No  I’m not mocking you   or you beautiful guest room. 
Joey, Hey  what’s up?
Chandler, Nothing  Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Joey, But you’re still moving in together  right? Because my ad came out today. 
Chandler,"  ""Wanted. Female roommate  non-smoker  non-ugly."" Nice!"
Joey, Yeah? I just figured y’know  after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate  y’know? Someone I can learn from  someone-someone who’s different than me. And what’s more different than me; a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh?  Not just a hat rack my friend!
Rachel, Pheebs  I have to ask you…
Phoebe, Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
Rachel, You’re just staring into space.
Phoebe, Umm  I’m trying to move that pencil. 
Rachel, This one? 
Phoebe, It worked!
Rachel," Pheebs  this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean  look at this;  ""Wanted. Female roommate  non-smoker  non-ugly."" It’s just  there is nothing! The city’s full!"
Phoebe," Wait  no  look at this!   ""Two bedroom  two bath  must be non-smoker  Satan worshipers okay…"" Oh  yeah  but it’s on the ground floor."
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Rach  uh  you still looking for a place?
Rachel, Yeah! Why?
Ross, Okay  there’s this guy  Warren  from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh  you interested?
Rachel, That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!
Ross, Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something  thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago  killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.
Rachel, Oh  this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh  thank you!
Ross, Okay  you go grab it!
Phoebe, I saw it.
Ross, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Phoebe, Umm  I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Ross, Look  I do not re-love her.
Phoebe, I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay  just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
Ross, Look  we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Rachel,  Ugh!!! Well  the apartment is already subletted! I mean  this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.
Ross, You can live with me.
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe, What?!
Ross, What?
Rachel, Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ross, Uh-huh. 
Rachel, I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!
Ross, Well  I’m-I’m just glad I could  y’know  help you out.
Phoebe, Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so  not stupid.
Rachel, Ross-Ross  you have no idea what this means to me! I mean  I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!
Ross, Hero  I uh  I don’t know—well  all right.
Rachel, Oh  I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! 
Ross, Oh please!   You’re gonna say things now  aren’t ya?
Phoebe, No. No  I won’t. But I should tell you this  this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her  but he really did  and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!   Okay  that’s a lie.
Chandler, Hi.
Monica, Hi.
Chandler, Hi  listen  I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls  and now I can ‘em—Now  I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way  I see women…
Monica, Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, Yeah! Oh yes!
Chandler, Ohh.
Monica, Listen  we don’t have to make that a guest room  we can think of something to do with the room together.
Chandler, That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Monica, Totally!
Chandler, We don’t have to come up with this now.
Monica, Oh good.
Chandler, Hey  y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Monica, Changes?
Chandler, Yeah  I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. 
Monica, You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Chandler, Is that a problem?
Monica, Well  it’s a set and they should probably stay together.
Chandler, Oh  that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.
Monica, See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
Chandler, Okay  I get it. So  I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes  and head off to work!
Monica, Yeah-yeah  y’know what? Yeah  that’s it-that’s it  everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on  Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just  it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!
Chandler, In the game room!
Monica, Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Chandler, All right! That’s fine! That’s fine! I won’t bring over the chairs! I won’t bring anything over! I wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma’s place!! 
Joey,  Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm  are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Joey, Whoa!! Now look  don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?
Chandler,  You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! I’ll be living here. 
Joey, Oh don’t listen to him  he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment  but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.
Chandler, Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Joey, That thing was a hazard!  I’m very safety conscious.
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, Hey! Oh listen  I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel, Oh thanks  but listen  I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.
Ross, What do you mean  they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
Rachel, No-no  they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Ross, What?! Over a stupid room!
Rachel, Yeah  I feel kinda bad for them  but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!
Ross, Oh no  yeah no  that part’s great!
Ross, What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean  that is so silly!
Monica, Ross  we can handle this.
Ross, Well  apparently not  and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean  enough of the silliness!
Chandler, Well  why don’t you tell her to stop being silly! 
Ross,  Okay-okay! Two very good points  look I’ve known you both a long time  and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important  love or silliness?
Chandler, Well  we are fond of the silliness  but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Monica, Love is the best medicine.
Chandler, That’s laughter.
Monica, Why do you do it?
Chandler, I don’t know.
Ross, Okay! All right! Now  Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica  right?
Chandler, Yeah  I do.
Ross, And Mon  you wanna live with Chandler  don’t ya?
Monica, Yes.
Ross,  Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! 
Rachel, No-no  I’m staying put.
Rachel, Why  where are you going?
Ross,  Hey Rach!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, You’re never gonna believe it uh  Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
Rachel, Oh wow.
Ross, Yeah but  on the bright side  we get to be roommates again.
Rachel, Yeah. Y’know umm  uh  umm  about that  umm  Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything  but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?
Ross, Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it  why would it be weird?
Rachel, Well  because of us! Because of our history.
Ross, No!
Rachel, No?
Ross, No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place  I mean are you still in that place?
Rachel, No! Not at all!
Ross, Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Rachel, Okay  but Ross  eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross, Really?! We are?
Rachel, Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend  you’re gonna have a girlfriend…
Ross, Ohh! That would be great.
Rachel," But y’know what  if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know  it’ll be like college  I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign  ""Come back later  I’m gettin’ lucky."" "
Ross,  Yeah  I didn’t think of that.
Ross, So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!
Monica, That’s very funny!
Chandler, He’s being silly  because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Ross, No  I-I-I’m serious  okay? I mean  think about it. You move in  you start fighting over stupid game rooms  next thing y’know you break up!
Monica, Ross  you were right before  it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Ross, Okay  there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room  this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately  this room  could destroy you!!
Chandler, Yeah  I'm not so worried.
Monica, Yeah  no  me neither.
Ross, Fine! It’s your life!  I just don’t want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together   but that’s what you want  there’s nothing I can do.  DON’T DO IT!!!!! 
Monica, You still want to move in together right?
Chandler, Of course!
Monica, Ross didn’t scare you?
Chandler, Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica, Come here  I want to show you something!
Chandler, Okay!
Chandler, Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
Monica, This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.
Chandler, Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Monica, Okay!
Chandler," Y’know those big-big uh  road signs that say ""Merge?"""
Monica, Uh-hmm.
Chandler, Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because  that’s you and I together! Merge!
Monica, Oh my God! I love that!
Chandler, Really?!
Monica, Uh  no!!
Phoebe,  I found you in my bed!
Phoebe, Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows  then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ross,  So umm  where are the other guys?
Rachel, Umm  well let’s see Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Ross, Fighting?!
Rachel, No  the other thing. I really think it’s great they work things out.
Ross, Yeah. There’s no breaking them up  is there?
Rachel, Hey  can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?
Ross, Sure! Here. 
Rachel, Thank you.  Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy  there’s no turning back.
Ross, Yeah  I’m-I’m sure.  Yeah  get out of here before I change my mind. 
Joey, Umm  listen  Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
Ross, I’ve been back and forth.
Joey, Yeah well  maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in  and before you know it you’re right where you don’t want to be! Back together!
Ross, Ehh  I don’t  I don’t think so. She’s already talked about y’know  dating other guys.
Joey," That’s not gonna work out! Then she’s gonna come home all weepy and you’ll be tellin’ her  ""Oh that’s okay. You’ll find someone."" And then  bamn! She finds you!"
Ross, Yeah  well  m-maybe you’re right.
Joey, I am telling you Ross  she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now  is that what you want?
Ross, Is that what I want?
Phoebe,  Yes.
Joey, Here she comes. Hold on  I’m gonna make your life much easier.
Rachel, All right  well the place was closed. I’ll just copy it later.
Joey, Or not. Uh  Rach  why don’t you just move in with me? 
Ross, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa  Joey!
Joey, No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay  I mean I—look Rach  I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing  but we don’t have to do that!
Rachel, Well  it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute  unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
Joey, Thursday’s clearly not good for ya  pick a day!
Joey,  Hi!
Joey, Come in. Thanks for comin’ back  umm  okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room  but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!
Joey, Okay now  before I make my final decision I uh  I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay  so I made up a little test. Now  I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
Joey, Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Joey, Very good! Okay. G.
Joey, Excellent! Okay umm  doggy.
Joey, Ooh  sorry! No-no-no  so close though  but—bye-bye! 
Rachel, So  which of this kitchen stuff is mine?
Monica, This bottle opener. 
Rachel, And?
Monica, And it’s a magnet!
Rachel, Look at that!
Ross, How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh  in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
Rachel, What?!
Ross,  You complete me kitchen  matey!
Phoebe, Ross  I know what you’re thinking.
Ross, What?
Phoebe, That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married  she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just  you’re very sad.
Ross, Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
Phoebe, What?!!
Ross," Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always  ""Ross  what are you gonna do about Rachel?"" ""Ross  why-why are you moving in with Rachel?"" ""When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"" You want her!"
Phoebe, No! 
Ross,  Uh-oh  saved by the bell.  Hello?
Monica, Hey Rach  aren’t these candlesticks  mine?
Rachel, No-no  I bought those.
Monica, Ohh! Yeah  I forgot.
Rachel, Yeah. 
Monica,  That you’re a liar. 
Ross,  No-no-no  that’s great! I’ll be there Monday. And thank you again!  Okay.   Umm  that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh  Y  uh U!
Monica, Wow! Uh what  did he uh  say?
Ross, Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate  huh? They loved it.
Rachel, Well  who wouldn’t?!
Ross," I know! Anyway  they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary  but uh  if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox  huh? ""Professor Geller."""
Phoebe, Yeah  Professor and Mrs.
Rachel, And Mrs.?!
Phoebe, Oh! Yeah  y’know you and Ross are still married.
Rachel, What?!!
Phoebe, Just kidding!
Rachel, Ohh! Oh God! 
Phoebe,  Saved your ass.
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hi.
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Oh  what’s the matter?
Phoebe, Well  you know that psychic I see?
Chandler, Yeah?
Phoebe, Well  she told me that I’m gonna die this week  so I’m kinda bummed about that.
Chandler, What?!
Phoebe, Yeah  and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings  but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Monica, Phoebe that’s crazy!
Joey, I can’t believe she would say that too you.
Rachel, Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
Phoebe, I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Chandler, Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?
Phoebe, No  ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session  and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left  y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!   leans back  and starts reading.)
Ross,  Hey everyone!
Chandler, Oh hi!
Ross, Hey uh  well  today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys  do you  do you mind?
Ross,"  ""There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"""
Phoebe, Oh  this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
Ross,"  ""…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…"""
Joey,  Uh Ross! Are there uh  are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Ross, No! Why?
Joey, Well  I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.
Ross," Ohh! Okay! Okay.  ""There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into…"""
Chandler, Why don’t you open with a joke?
Ross, Open with a joke? It’s a university  not a comedy club!
Chandler, Wait a minute  hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!
Ross,  Okay!
Rachel, Ross  hey you know what might make it less boring?
Ross, Thank you!
Rachel, Some uh  some visual aides.
Joey, Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?
Ross, Please don’t say naked chicks.
Joey, Why not?!
Ross, I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Chandler, That’s the way I did it ‘til I was 19.
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Hey! Any good mail?
Chandler, Yes  you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.
Joey, Ooh  it’s probably a residual check  hey can you open it for me  I’m kinda….
Chandler,"  ""Benefits lapsed."""
Joey, Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Chandler, Okay  it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because  you didn’t work enough last year.
Joey, Let me see that!
Chandler, All right.
Joey,  Oh  I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire  y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
Chandler, I’m sorry man  there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
Joey, All right well  I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
Chandler, Okay  make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Joey,  …look both ways before you cross the street. 
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey Pheebs  you’re still alive! How are you doing?
Phoebe, Ugh  it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh  by the way  do you think you could—
Rachel, Pheebs  what-what are you doing?
Phoebe, I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?
Rachel, Oh yeah  scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs  you lie down?
Phoebe, Yeah  thanks. And listen  can you do me a favor? Could you just umm  wake me up in a couple hours  y’know if you can.
Rachel, Monica!
Monica, Hmm? 
Rachel, Did-did you take these back?
Monica, No-no  I-I just  I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Rachel, Oh yeah  they’re really great! Aren’t they?
Monica, I loved them!
Rachel, Yeah.  Nice try! 
Ross,  Hello!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, How’d the lecture go?
Ross, It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Rachel, Wow  that’s great Ross  I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.
Ross," I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all  ""Ross you have to be funny and sexy."" Well  I proved them wrong! And now  I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler."
Monica, That you’re not funny or sexy?
Ross, That’s right!
Joey,  Hey Estelle  listen…
Joey, What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!
Joey, Yeah!
Joey, Estelle  you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
Joey, Why?
Joey, Bastard!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey,  Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
Chandler, That’s great  but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?
Joey, What?!
Chandler, What’s wrong with you?
Joey, Nothing! Well  I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before  then I uh passed out and uh  haven’t been able to stand up since. But um  I don’t think it’s anything serious.
Chandler, This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!
Joey, No way! ‘Kay look  if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! 
Chandler, That’s a hernia.
Joey, Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
Rachel, Well  we’re a little early  the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.
Monica, Yeah  but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
Rachel, Yeah  we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Hey sisters!   Wow  we really are bitches.
Ross,  Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous  was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation when— Oh bloody hell.
Monica, What the hell are you doing?!
Ross, Look  I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Rachel, Yeah  and not a very good one.
Ross, Will you-will you please?
Ross, Oh.
Ross,  I’m sorry  I’ve got plans with my sister.
Monica,  Monica Gellerrr. 
Ross,  Right  will you excuse us for one moment?   What are you doing?
Monica,  Oh  you can have an accent and I can’t?!  Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!
Ross, Just please stop!
Rachel,  Yes  yes  Bombay is bery  bery nice time of year.
Chandler, Hey  will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Joey, Dude! Hernia operations cost like  a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful  that means it’s healing.
Chandler, I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.
Joey, Thank you  but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides  as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah  I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, What’s going on?
Chandler, Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia  but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!
Joey, Look  I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.
Phoebe, Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
Joey, Sure  now I’m scared.
Phoebe, No  we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though  okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
Joey, Yeah  but I don’t wanna die!
Phoebe, No-no  it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Monica, Gimme ‘em!
Rachel, No! They are mine!
Monica, You stole them from me!
Rachel, You stole them from me!!
Monica, Gimme them!
Monica, You just wanna each take one?
Rachel, Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Ross,  Look  I really need some help  okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
Rachel, Well…
Monica, Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah  fade the accent out and people will think you’re  y’know  that you’re adjusting to life in America.
Rachel, Yeah  I mean  come on Ross  no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!
Ross, They’re not listening too me?
Rachel, Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Ross, Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Monica, I think you look fine.
Joey,"  Okay. ""Hey  Timmy  I’ve got a surprise for you."""
Joey," Oh yeah  sure  no problem  I’ll just—hold on one second.   ""Hey Timmy  I’ve got a surprise for you!"""
Joey, So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! 
Joey, Exactly.
Joey, Or  I could just point to it! Huh? Blah  blah  blah  Purina One  point to a bag today.  I didn’t get it  did I?
Joey, Yeah  okay. 
Joey, Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for  man.
Joey, Yes!
Monica, Okay  come on  do it one more time!
Rachel, Really? Really?!
Monica, Yes!
Rachel," Okay!   ""Hello Ross  this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University  we’d like you to come on board with us full time! "
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Listen to this! My reading was wrong  I’m not going die!
Rachel, Really?! How do you know?
Phoebe, Because my psychic is dead! She must’ve read the cards wrong!
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry.
Phoebe, Eh  better her than me! Hey  let’s bake cookies!
Chandler, Listen  I’m really glad you got the part.
Joey,  Thank you.
Chandler, But are you sure you can do this?
Joey, Yeah! And hey  thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Chandler, Now  is that never talking about it again?!
Joey,  Hiya!
Joey, Hi Alex!  And uh  as you can see my hands are not in my pants. 
Joey," ""Take could care of your Momma son.""  ""Take could care of your Momma son.""  ""Come on son! Your Momma’s good people!"""
Joey, Ah  just one thing umm  is it all right with you if I  if I scream right up until you say action?
Joey, Okay. 
Joey,"  ""Take good care of your Momma son."" "
Chandler, I’m sorry! Hey-hey Joe  why don’t you uh  lift up your shirt?  Take a look at this kiddo.  We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Rachel,  Hello?
Rachel, Uh no  he’s not. Can I take a message?
Rachel, Ross got married again—Nooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Ross,  All right  keep going. We are phasing the accent out  phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . Were there any questions at this point?  Yes. 
Ross,  Come again? What’s-what’s this nonsense?   All right  I’m-I’m not English. I’m from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh  just came out. I’m sorry. So  if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm  were there any questions?  About paleontology.  All right  look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously  I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…
Rachel, Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What  were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh  I could just kill you!!!!
Ross,  Well  hello Rachel!
Phoebe, Have you really done this before?
Joey, Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big  big swing. Now  don’t hold back.  and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey-hey-hey!
Chandler, What are you doing?
Phoebe, We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Chandler, Oh  all right.
Rachel, I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!
Ross, Look I was going to tell you!
Rachel, When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.
Chandler, What?
Monica, You’re kidding!
Phoebe,  Oh my God!!
Monica, Ross!
Ross, Okay  maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.
Chandler, Okay  let me just jump in and ask  at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Ross, Rach  come on  if you think about it  it’s actually kinda funny.  Okay  maybe it’s best not to think about it.
Phoebe, Okay  this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
Ross, Phoebe  I told her you already knew.
Phoebe, Another lie. You have a sickness!
Chandler, Ross  just for my own piece of mind  you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?
Joey, Oh! Hey  somebody left their keys.  Ooohh  to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche  I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther  these yours?
Joey, Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Monica, Joey  why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
Joey, There’s a lost and found?  My shoe! 
Chandler, You left a shoe here?!
Joey, Well  I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield. 
Chandler, Oh good  when he comes back for his keys  I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
Joey, Great! Thanks. 
Phoebe,  Oh  good  good  you guys are here! Listen  how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Monica, Oh my God  what a fun day! That sounds great!
Chandler,  Yeah  all right.
Phoebe, Okay  well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay  and uh  by the way  they’re not actually puppies  they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay  see ya! 
Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Phoebe,  Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
Monica, Don’t worry about it Phoebe  we’ll absolutely do it.
Chandler, Yeah  I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Monica, Come on Chandler  come on! It’ll give us great practice for when——people with babies come to visit.
Joey, Yeah  it’s not mine.
Joey, Yeah  it’s  mine.
Joey, Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh  do you like leather seats?
Joey,  It’s got ‘em!
Rachel, So  I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s  and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.
Phoebe, What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while  I don’t have a roommate.
Rachel, Well  maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.
Phoebe, Maybe you could be my roommate!
Rachel, Well there’s an idea!!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, That would be great! Wait  how long is Denise gone for?
Phoebe, Umm  she said she’d be back December 26th.
Rachel, December 26th  huh maybe she’s Santa Clause.
Rachel,  Oh look who it is  my husband. The apple of my eye.
Ross, Okay  I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
Rachel, Well sure  if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right  now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!
Ross, Okay Rach  but…
Rachel, Op! You’re peeping!
Rachel, Ross! Y’know what  I just got—why? Why did you do this?!
Ross, Look I told you…
Rachel," I don’t wanna hear ""Three failed marriages!"""
Ross, Look  if you’d had two failed marriages  you’d understand!
Rachel, Well  y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross  I don’t think I have ever been this angry!
Ross, What about the time I said we were on a break?
Rachel, Ugh! 
Monica, Pheebs  how’s it going?
Phoebe,  I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Monica, Nope  sound like me. Pheebs  it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.
Chandler, Little baby girl Chandler  where I have heard that before? Oh right  Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When you’re done over there  we kinda have a situation over here too. 
Phoebe, Na-uh  no  we are all responsible for our own babies.
Chandler, See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
Monica, What do you mean?
Chandler, I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe  you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon  you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around… 
Phoebe, That sounds really great  but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
Chandler, Okay  I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Monica, This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Phoebe, Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.
Joey,  Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey babies! Oh  I’m having the best morning. That uh  that Porsche I’ve got the keys too  still there!
Chandler, Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
Joey, You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk  and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
Chandler, What equity investments?
Joey, The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured  if-if people keep seeing me just standing there  they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica  you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Monica, Oh yeah  I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.
Chandler, You don’t even have a car!
Monica, I know. But umm  one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building  so I washed it.
Chandler, And?
Monica, And six others.
Chandler, There you are.
Joey, Yeah  she tops out at 130.
Joey, And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
Joey, Sure!
Joey, Okay  take it easy.
Joey, Really? Oh uh  oh just give me five more minutes with it.
Joey, Oh I-I uh  found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.
Joey, Yeah  but it’s my wax.
Joey, Sure. Here.  I’ll uh  save your parking spot.
Joey, Why not?
Joey, Yeah  so did I.
Phoebe, I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Monica, Yeah  two hours  a lifetime that’s the same.
Chandler,  Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up  they can meet Krog! 
Monica, Chandler  what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!
Chandler, He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
Phoebe, No Chandler  they can swallow one of those little parts! And also  look at his smooth area  that’s just gonna mess them up.
Chandler, They’re not gonna swallow anything  you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid  my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
Phoebe, What?!
Chandler, Glass  sand  whatever. 
Phoebe, Oh  look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Monica, Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Phoebe, Oh  I can still do that.
Monica, How are you still single?!
Chandler,  All right.  I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Monica, Good. What made you change your mind?
Chandler, I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
Phoebe, How did that happen?!!
Chandler, Well  I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.  
Monica, Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and  and no one was watching Chandler! 
Rachel, Yes your honor  and here are  are forms  all filled out.
Ross, Fine  I’m mentally unstable.
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Uh yes  heroin and crack.
Ross, Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
Rachel, Well  you would know.
Ross, Oh  come on!
Rachel,  Ross  please  I found the magazines!
Ross, Okay  I’m sorry  this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin  I’m not gay  and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look  I’ll consummate this marriage right here  right now!
Ross, And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Rachel, Ugh!
Rachel," Ross! Your honor  rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?"
Rachel, Well  yes  we got married in Vegas and uh  and the names I think.
Ross,  That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny  funny form!
Rachel,  What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Ross, And what——What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don’t get the annulment. Don’t type that! What?! Stop typing!  Hey! Stop typing!  Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Rachel,  Okay  do you see  do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!
Rachel, All right look lady here is the deal  I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, And thank you for your time. 
Joey,  So the Porsche guy took his car back.
Chandler, But you found the keys to his clothes?
Joey, No. No  I just uh  I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
Monica, And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?
Joey, Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?
Chandler, That is true.
Phoebe, Yeah  but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Joey, Oh  I’ve been there. Yeah  I am gonna go drive my Porsche. 
Monica, Joey  you know you don’t actually have one.
Joey, Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her! 
Chandler, Ahh  I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
Monica, All right  that’s it  we’re going to the emergency room.
Phoebe, What?! No  you can’t  you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!
Monica, The babies are asleep  I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!
Phoebe, But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
Monica, He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat  we’ve got to go to the hospital.
Phoebe, But no  because a doctor won’t be able to help him  it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Chandler, I think that’s gum.
Phoebe, I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
Chandler, Okay  listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
Phoebe, A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!  No! What would  what would Krog do? 
Joey, Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?
Joey,  Porsche.
Rachel, This is totally your fault!
Ross, My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Rachel, Well  you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
Ross, That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Joey, Hi! How are the Gellers?
Rachel, Don’t call us that! 
Ross, The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? 
Joey, Hey! It’s Porsche!! 
Phoebe," Me taking care of you is no problem  huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay  I’m gonna take that spit bubble as  ""Yeah  I do!"" Okay  after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie  I’ll set you up with a clean one.  Okay  I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? ‘Cause let’s face it  we’re at Monica’s.  I broke it. All right. Well  that’s just the way that goes.  Okay  good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well  you can’t answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie  now would be a good time for your first words!  Well  look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh  you’re a lot mischievous! Well  it’ll dry.   Okay  you sit with your brother and sister now—who aren’t there! "
Chandler,  Hey!
Phoebe,  How do you feel?
Chandler, Well  let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Phoebe, Okay  so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em  bathed ‘em  and put ‘em to bed.
Chandler, And protected them from a tornado?
Monica, Oh my God.
Phoebe, I know  the babies are asleep.
Monica, Phoebe  what  what happened here?!
Phoebe, I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
Monica, But my apartment!
Chandler, Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.
Monica, But the mess!
Chandler, Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Monica, You’re right  you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Chandler,  Phoebe  would you take a look at this mess!!!!
Rachel,  Oh honey thank God you’re home  I was getting worried.
Ross, I picked up the divorce papers. Uh  I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
Rachel, Oh  little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!
Ross, Y’know  I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Rachel, Oh  name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!
Ross, Okay  how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah  how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Rachel, Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!
Ross, Yeah! Right!
Ross, You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s  let’s just sign the papers. All right?  What?
Rachel, Nothing. 
Ross, Okay  can we just sign please?
Rachel, Uh-hmm. 
Ross, Congratulations. 
Rachel, Okay Ross  we’re—wait a minute. Umm  I uh  I kinda have a little confession.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Well  y’know this whole marriage thing  kinda my idea.
Ross, Excuse me?
Rachel, Well  remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, And uh  yeah  I didn’t really  I didn’t want to say anything  but it kinda it just  it kinda kept coming back to me  and umm  remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh  and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a  as a compromise we decided first to get married  and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm  sorry I got us into this mess.
Ross, So then if-if—I mean if you think about it  this is all  your fault.
Rachel, Yeah  don’t push it though.
Ross, I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women  never thought I would be divorcing you.
Rachel, I know. I always thought if you and I got married  it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret  and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. 
Ross, Did I  did I even treat?
Rachel, No  it was on the house  it was  it was a newlywed special.
Ross, That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
Rachel, Hey  thanks Ross  for taking care of all of this.
Ross, Eh  no problem.
Rachel, I’m gonna need a copy of those.
Ross, Totally. 
Joey, Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
Joey, Hey! How you doin’?
Joey, I’d love to show ya  but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.  Hey uh  would you two girls like to go for a drink? 
Chandler,  Okay!  Listen  I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Joey, Right! And when is that due?
Chandler, First of the month.
Joey, And that’s every month?
Chandler, No  just the months you actually want to live here.
Joey, Ahhh.
Chandler, Okay  here is the phone bill. 
Joey,  Oh my God!!
Chandler, That’s our phone number. Now look  I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing  so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?
Joey, No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
Chandler, It’s not charity  Joe…
Joey, No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks  but I’m done taking money from you. All right  I can take of myself. Now  what’s next? Come on.
Chandler, Okay uh  here’s the electric bill. 
Joey, This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
Chandler, Uh  yeah.
Chandler, So  we’ll do the rest of the bills later then?
Phoebe, So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
Chandler, No  I hope not! I tried to offer him some money  but he wouldn’t take it.
Phoebe, Well  how much do you think he needs?
Chandler, I figure that $1 500 would cover him for a few months  y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
Phoebe, Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
Chandler, Well that would help the pride thing.
Monica,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Monica,  Okay.
Chandler, Okay!  So  what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Monica, Well  instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
Phoebe, And also  my birthday.
Monica, It’s not your birthday.
Phoebe, What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Chandler, Well  instead of just hanging out  we figure we’d do nothing.
Ross, Whoa-whoa-whoa  Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Joey, I don’t know Ross  not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Ross, I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
Rachel,  Pheebs  I was wondering…
Monica, You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Rachel, Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
Monica, Rachel  you are packed though right  I mean please tell me that you’re packed.
Rachel, Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Phoebe, My God  I can’t get a minute of peace around this place.
Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.
Rachel, Yeah  yeah  I know.
Phoebe, Well  what you’re wearing is fine for that.
Monica,  Rachel  I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!
Rachel, Surprise!!
Monica, What?
Rachel," No  no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing  then I realized  ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So  as a gift to you  on our last night  ta-da!"
Monica,  I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry  I didn’t get you anything! Okay  look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help  can’t you Phoebe?
Phoebe, I have plans.
Monica, You’re plans were with us.
Phoebe, That’s right.
Monica, All right  Chandler can make boxes  Ross can wrap  and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe  go tell the guys they have to help out!
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Okay!  Oh my God  thank you!!
Phoebe, Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now  it’s too late for me  but save your selves! 
Monica,  Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now  everybody has to help! Chandler  we’re gonna start with…
Chandler, Oh nope  I-I have plans with Joey.
Monica, I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
Chandler, Yes  but for the last time.
Monica, Okay fine  now Ross…
Ross, Oh  but-but I can’t do it.
Monica, Why not?
Joey,  I’ve got Ben.
Ross, Because  because I’ve got Ben.
Monica, It’s almost 8 o’clock  it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Chandler, He’s at a dinner party.
Monica, Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Ross, Of course he is! What  do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Monica, All right  sorry. 
Ross,  I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Joey, Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
Chandler, Oh  I wish I’d know you were going to do that  I ordered Chinese.
Joey, Oh that’s okay. Hey  actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me  bringing the food of my ancestors  you  the food of yours!
Chandler, Say  Joe  I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh  foosball for money?
Joey, What  are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
Chandler, Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Joey, Okay  you’re on.
Chandler, Okay  let’s play! The big game  Italy vs. China  apparently.
Rachel, Ohhhhhh  look it’s the roller blades.
Monica,  Oh God!
Rachel, You remember when we got these?
Monica, No.
Rachel, I guess you weren’t there. 
Phoebe, You guys  we said we were gonna have fun! Come on  hey  remember the time…  You don’t remember?
Rachel, I’m sorry Pheebs  I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.
Monica, I’m gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe, Well  this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other  you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
Monica, I don’t think there’s anything.
Phoebe, Come on  there’s gotta be something.
Monica, Nope  she’s perfect.
Rachel, I have one.
Phoebe, Good! Great! You can go first.
Rachel, Uh well  I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen. 
Phoebe, Good that’s a good one. Okay  Monica  anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Monica, Aw  sometimes. Always  actually.
Phoebe, Okay  good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
Monica, Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
Rachel, You get your messages!
Monica, Yeah  well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
Rachel, So-so  you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
Phoebe, Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
Joey,  Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That’s like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food.
Chandler, Okay  give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death  one goal  $1 000.
Joey, You serious?
Chandler, Oh yes!
Joey, Okay  get ready to owe me!
Chandler, Okay.
Joey, Okay  here we go. Ready?
Chandler, No! No! No! No——one can beat me.
Chandler, See? Now  that’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Monica, Hello?  Oh  hi Ross!  See? Other people call me!
Rachel, Ooh  your brother. Score!
Monica,  What’s up?
Ross, Oh  I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
Monica, Oh  put him on!
Ross, Ben  say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh  I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay  talk to you later.
Phoebe, Yeah  I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey  uh  remember the roller blades?
Rachel," You know what else I’m not gonna miss? ""I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"""
Monica," ""Hi I’m Rachel  is my sweater too tight? No? Oh  I’d better wash it and shrink it!"""
Rachel," ""I’m Monica  I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"""
Phoebe, Hey! I call her!
Monica," ""Oh my God  I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"""
Rachel," ""Oh my God  I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"""
Phoebe, Yeah  we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. 
Chandler, Still broken?
Joey, This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life  the foosball table and $500.
Chandler, Well  there are other ways of winning back your money  how about a little uh  a little Blackjack? 
Joey, Nah  not my game.
Chandler, Okay  uh  how about  how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game  it’s fun.
Joey, Well  what’s it called?
Chandler, Cups.
Joey, I don’t know how to play Cups.
Chandler, I’ll teach ya! Come on  come on  it’s really easy and really  really fun.
Joey, All right.
Chandler, Okay  here you go.  I have two queens  what do you have?
Joey, A two and a five.
Chandler, Ho-ho  you win! 50 dollars!
Joey, Really?!
Chandler, Oh yeah! Okay  let’s play again.  What do you got?
Joey, A four and a nine.
Chandler, You’re kidding right?
Joey, No. Why?
Chandler, Well that’s a full cup! 
Joey, Damn! I am good at Cups!
Monica, I’m not talking to her!
Phoebe, Well  one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you  because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
Monica, Well  maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!
Phoebe, I know  I took it hard too.
Monica, Listen Rachel  I feel really bad about—What are you doing? 
Rachel, I’m unpacking!
Monica, What?!
Rachel, I’m not moving!  Is that picture straight?
Monica, It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
Rachel, Hey  y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Monica, Because it’s my apartment!
Rachel, Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
Monica, How about  you’re moving!! 
Rachel, Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! 
Phoebe, Hey  how are you guys doing?
Rachel, Great! Monica’s moving!
Monica,  I am not!
Rachel, Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! 
Phoebe, Okay  you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay  you guys… STOP!!  I know that  I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
Monica, No Phoebe I am mad!
Phoebe, Well  deep-deep-deep down!
Rachel, Yeah  I’m just mad!
Phoebe, Then keep running. 
Chandler, You win.
Joey, Well  what did you have?
Chandler, It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay  now much have you won so far?
Joey, Uh   wow  700.
Chandler, Not 700 exactly?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Double it! 
Joey, What?
Chandler, Well you see in Cups  once you get $700  you have to double it.
Joey, Really?
Chandler, Hey  I didn’t make up the rules. Now  after you receive the doubling bonus  you get uh  one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1 500.  Don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get—No way! 
Monica," Well  this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it  ""What were you thinking?"""
Rachel, Funny  because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe, Hey you guys  I don’t mean to make things worse  but umm  I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Phoebe, You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel, Well  Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Monica, Whoa-whoa-whoa  Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her  but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
Rachel, Oh really? Like what Monica?
Monica, Y’know she has 147 000 pairs of boots…
Rachel, Oh yeah  good start Mon.
Monica, She lets you borrow them.
Rachel, Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
Monica, Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm  she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Phoebe, What else?
Monica, When I take a shower  she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel, Yeah  I do. I-I do  do that.
Phoebe, That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica, When I fall asleep on the couch after reading  she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel, Well y’know  I don’t want you to be cold.
Monica, And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler  she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! 
Rachel, Oh  it’s gonna be fine.
Phoebe, Okay Rachel  I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!
Rachel, But honey  I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
Phoebe, Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
Monica, Kinda.  Oh my God!
Ross,  Hello?  Hey Mon  how’s the packing going?  Ben? He’s fine. Yeah  he’s right—Oh my God!  Get your head of your shirt there son!  What?  Yeah  it’s a pumpkin. I’ll come pack.
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, What’s wrong?
Joey, Ross and I were helping the girls pack  took a little break  I lost $1 500 to him in Cups!
Chandler, Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
Joey, The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen  bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King  boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card  the D-Cup  the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile  I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!
Chandler, Oh man!!
Joey, And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck  very important in Cups.
Chandler, All right  let’s play one more hand! One more!
Joey, No  no  no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact  look  there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now  I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a  y’know  thank you for being such a great roommate.
Chandler, I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
Joey, It’s him  not it!
Chandler, No  but wait—what if I bought it from you  y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price  say  $1 500?
Joey, Wait a second  I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!
Chandler, When did I try to give you money?
Joey," Over there!  Before  with the bills! You tried to give some charity  I said ""No "" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together  we had some fun  we gambled  nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue  you start with the charity thing again!"
Chandler, I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
Joey, I will be okay! Look Chandler  you gotta get it out of your head that I can’t take care of myself. Okay? Look  I’m not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I’m gonna miss…is you. And now the dog.
Monica, Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, I’m really gonna miss you.
Rachel, Oh! I have your key. Here you go. 
Monica, Thanks.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Oh God! This is silly  I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours! 
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Bye house!
Rachel, Bye Mon.
Monica, Bye.
Chandler,  Hey.
Monica, She really left.
Chandler, I know. 
Monica, Thank you.
Chandler, No problem roomie. 
Monica, Can I ask you a question?
Chandler, Sure!
Monica, What the hell is that dog doing here?! 
Chandler, I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
Ross, And now you want that money back.
Chandler, Exactly.
Ross, Chandler  what kind of an idiot do you take me for? 
Chandler, It’s not a real game! I made it up!
Ross, I’m sorry you lost your money  but I won it fair and square.
Chandler, At a fake game!!
Ross, Now  if you wanna try to make some of it back  I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you  I am very good at Cups.
Chandler, Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
Ross, No.
Chandler, Hmm  let’s see if it comes up this time. 
Phoebe, Ready?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, Hi...
Phoebe, it's...
Rachel, Rachel...
Phoebe, and…
Rachel, Phoebe’s...
Phoebe, please...
Rachel, leave...
Phoebe, leave…
Rachel," Wait  I-I just said ""leave."""
Phoebe," Yeah  I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get ""it’s "" ""and"" oh I'm sorry  I have ""A."" Forget it."
Rachel, Phoebe  come on that's silly.
Phoebe, All right  so let's switch.
Rachel, No  I have all of the good words. OK  fine  fine  we can switch.
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Hi…
Rachel, Everybody…
Phoebe, It's…
Rachel, Rachel…
Phoebe, and…
Rachel, Phoebe’s…
Phoebe, Please...wait  how did you do that?
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Oh  you're no ordinary roommate are you?
Rachel, Phoebe  come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Phoebe, Really?
Rachel, Yeah  it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
Phoebe, Okay  let's go running!
Rachel, Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Phoebe, Let's run towards them!
Rachel, OK!
Phoebe, All right  wait just one more second. Hi  it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message  thanks!
Rachel, Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
Phoebe, Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
Ross, So  I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030  there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
Chandler,  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Monica, Hey!
Monica,  Honey  that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
Chandler, I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Monica, Oh  So you can move them!
Chandler, Yes  and while I'm doing that  Ross has a great computer story for you.
Joey, Hey everybody! Uh  I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
Ross, Hi! 
Joey, Yeah  she's gonna live with me!
Monica, It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Joey, I didn't know that! Well  what a pretty last name!
Chandler, So  uh  wh-where ya from?
Joey,  From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
Ross, So uh  wha-uh  what do you do?
Joey, You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
Joey, Oh  hey let me. 
Monica, Joey  did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Joey, Of course I did.
Monica, Uh-huh  what exactly did you ask her?
Joey," ""When can you move in?"""
Ross, Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Chandler, Unbelievable
Monica, Oh  so you like her too Chandler?
Chandler, Hey  look at all the boxes!
Joey, Ugh  I cannot wait to ask her out!
Monica, Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out  she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Ross, Yeah  yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her  then-then-then I can't date her.
Chandler, All right  think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Joey, Oh God  yeah.
Chandler, Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Joey,  Okay!
Chandler, No-no
Joey, Oh  Oh  you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
Monica, Yeah and you better watch the flirting too  cause you know  in such close quarters  it could be trouble.
Joey, Well  that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Monica,  Hmm  well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
Joey, You a little sad about that sweetheart?
Phoebe, I have to tie my shoe  so you go ahead  I'll catch up.
Rachel, Okay. 
Phoebe, Okay.  Come on! That's not running! Let's go! 
Rachel, You guys  I'm telling you  when she runs  she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
Ross, Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah  she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Rachel, Oh! I used to do that too!
Monica, Did you also have his album  It's Not Easy Being Green?
Rachel, Aw  Mon...
Monica, So  Phoebe runs weird huh?
Rachel, Yeah  yeah and you know what  I know she's gonna wanna run again  I just don't know how to get out of it  I mean  I live with her.
Monica, Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, You're right  you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Pheebs  Monica tripped me  I don't think I can ever run again  ever!
Phoebe, Why? Why would you do that?
Monica, I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Rachel, Ankle.
Monica, We'll see.
Chandler, OK  I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well  I guess Joey went home. Oh and look  there's still one box that I have to unpack. 
Joey,  I Gotcha!!
Chandler,  Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Joey, Boy  it was so hard not to laugh  I tell ya. Hey  hey  the place looks great!
Chandler, Yeah  not bad right? You know what  Monica’s gonna be working late  so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do  know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs  I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
Joey,  I don't! No  I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Chandler, Yeah  now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Joey, Yeah. Well  so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it.  How you doin?
Joey,  Ohhhh man
Joey, No-no-no-no-no  it's-it's uh  you just uh  uh reminded me that uh  I need to do my stretches too. 
Joey, 
Joey, Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!
Phoebe,  Hi! Oh yeah  uh-huh  it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
Rachel, No  no Phoebe no  I was...no. You know what  I was  I was actually just checking to  see  if I could run. And I can!
Phoebe, Please Rachel  I am not an idiot. 
Rachel, No  wait Phoebe.
Ross,  Wow  couples who live together do start to look alike. So  Mondler...uh  what uh  what ‘cha doin?
Chandler, What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Ross, Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Chandler, Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Ross, Put it back exactly where you found it?
Chandler, Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.
Ross, ‘Kay  first of all  this attitude is not helping.
Chandler, She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Ross, Whoa  hello  did you just meet Monica?
Chandler, She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and  appreciate it.
Ross, Hmm -you know  actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey  Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
Chandler, I see  I see  y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Ross, Look Chandler  Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me  I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God  she's going to sit on you.
Chandler, No  she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.
Monica,  Hi!
Chandler, Hey Mon  how's it going?
Monica, Terrible. If-if I want something done right  I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Chandler, Oh come on  come on  it can't be that bad.
Monica, It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Chandler, No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Monica,  Well  are you just hanging out with Ross?
Chandler, It's  all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
Ross, Yeah  the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.
Chandler, We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh  let's start with the couch.  I got it. 
Ross, Yeah that-that  doesn't look right.
Chandler, What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK  OK  here's what we do  we just uh  move the couch closer to the coffee table.
Ross, Whoa  whoa  but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
Chandler, OK well here  we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Ross, Whoa  Whoa  Whoa  but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Chandler, Yes  but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Joey,  Look  what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still  I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame!  What the hell's going on over here?!?!?  Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help  I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute  wait a minute  you guys repel women all the time.
Ross, Hey  I've been married 3 times
Joey, No-no-no I've seen it happen  you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Ross, Look  we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Chandler, Oh no  yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
Ross," Yeah  well what about you? You weren't you know  so hot in college either. After everything he said  he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh"""
Chandler, Yeah  Monica doesn't like that either  Maybe I should stop doing that.
Ross, Oh y'know what  girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
Chandler, That's not specific to girls.
Joey, This is great  this is great  what else  what else?
Ross, Uh  they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
Chandler, And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
Ross, They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Chandler, Man  I'm so lucky I have Monica.
Ross,  I'm never gonna find love again.
Rachel, Hey Phoebe  can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe, Sure
Rachel, Okay  um  I... All right Phoebe look  I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
Phoebe, So  what should you have done?
Rachel, Well  I-I should've told you the truth.
Phoebe, Uh-Huh  Which is...?
Rachel, Well  y'know  the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um  well y'know the way that you run is a little...
Phoebe, So?
Rachel, Well  it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Phoebe, Why do you care?
Rachel, Because they're people.
Phoebe, But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Rachel, Yes  but still. They're people…with eyes.
Phoebe, Well  I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no  okay. No  no  I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah  okay. You're uptight.
Rachel, I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen  I am not uptight  man.
Phoebe, That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid  cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know  I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know  like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog.
Chandler, Okay  is this lamp in the same place?
Ross, Who cares? I repel women.
Chandler,  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
Monica, What?!
Ross,  What?!
Chandler,  I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Ross, Why does anyone have to be naked?
Monica, Why is Ross naked?
Ross, I-I had to show Chandler something?
Monica, Naked?
Ross, Yeah-yeah I uh  I have a uh  a guy problem.
Monica, Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Chandler, Look  uh  just come later  we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Monica, Okay  listen  there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Chandler, Bye! Thank God
Ross, Dude  what'd you have?
Chandler, Look  we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
Ross,  The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
Chandler, That's perfect! That's brilliant! 
Ross, So really  what'd ya have?
Joey," Uh  don't you mean ""for whom?"""
Joey, Pizza  heh  its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Joey, All right  All right  let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But  we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey, No  no  no  I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is  what do we do?
Joey, Oh!
Joey, Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me  you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Joey, Oh  I do.  How you doin?
Joey, What?!?!
Joey, Oh dear God!
Rachel,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Oh honey  I'm so sorry  you were right  this feels great!
Phoebe, See? And you don't care if people are staring  it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Rachel, Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.  Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry! 
Monica, Is it okay for me to come in now?
Chandler, Uh-huh
Monica, Why is everything different?
Ross, Bye! 
Chandler, No  I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. 
Monica, Well  the end table is wrong  The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Chandler, Okay look  don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you  so  I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it  where it went back and I'm sorry  I'm very sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry.
Monica, It's okay. Chandler  are you afraid of me or something?
Chandler, Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Monica, Of course not. I mean gosh  Chandler what you did  it's  it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place  but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, Of course!
Chandler, Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Monica, All right  hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay  now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
Ross, So it said that by the year 2030  there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
Ross, That's so Janine  you-you-you know what  do you know we're doing right now? You and I  we're interfacing.
Chandler, Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Hi  my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Joey, Sure  neighbor come on in.
Chandler, So  is Janine around?
Joey, Uh  no  she’s at dance class.
Chandler, Can I check out what she did to my room?
Joey, Yeah  but  hey look  don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Chandler,  Oh my God. What is th… it’s like a guy never lived in here. Look  you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous.  It’s spreading already.
Joey,  It is???
Chandler,  Yeah  is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
Joey, No.
Chandler,  Is that your tiny little box  that’s too small to put anything in?
Joey, No.
Chandler, No! Ok  this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go  you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
Joey,  All right  you’re right. I’ll talk to her.
Chandler, Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Joey, I’m a man.
Chandler, Defend yourself.
Joey,  Hmm. 
Monica, Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Chandler, Be right there sweetums.  A totally different situation.
Monica, Hey guys.
Chandler, Hey  how was your breakfast with Hillary?
Monica, It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Chandler, Ohh  yeah.
Ross, Well  is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Monica, Yeah.
Ross, The one that always stares at me when I come in?
Monica, No  the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Ross, Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well  why don’t you set us up?
Rachel, Ohh  are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
Phoebe,  Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Phoebe, Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, I’m  uhh  making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So  can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
Rachel, Well  sure  but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
Phoebe, Oh my God. What happened?
Rachel, I-I  got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Phoebe, Well that’s great! Congratulations!! 
Rachel, Yeah.  A year ago..
Phoebe,  You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
Rachel, But  Pheebs  you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But  just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
Chandler, That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
Monica, I don’t think mine likes me either.
Ross, Maybe it’s a universal thing?
Joey, Or maybe  it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. 
Chandler, Yeah let’s head off to work.
Monica, We should go.
Phoebe, Thank you.
Rachel, Sure.
Phoebe, Now you will not believe this. But  I was in the copy room  making copies  and Ralph Lauren came in.
Rachel, Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Phoebe, Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Rachel, What? What!?! You kissed him?
Phoebe, Totally.
Rachel,  Phoebe are you serious?
Phoebe, Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know  we’re making out. You know.
Rachel, Phoebe  I mean  you do know he’s married?
Phoebe, No!
Rachel, Phoebe…
Phoebe, What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he’s married?  No  yeah  I should.
Joey, Hey. Uh  can I talk to you for a second? This  uh  kid in this picture. Do you  uh  know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
Joey, Yeah  that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay  uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here  but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.
Joey, Like this.  Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.
Joey, Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know  and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.
Joey, Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like  you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Joey, I’m sure it’s a famous watering can  okay. But  come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
Joey, Ohh  well  that’s ok then. But  okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.
Joey, Yeah  well  it feels different.
Joey, Alright  I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?
Joey,  Well that’s like summer in a bowl.
Rachel, Oh  Kim  Hi. 
Rachel, So you know  I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
Rachel, Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line  it’s really going to be great this year  huh?
Rachel, So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room. 
Ross, Hey guys.
Ross, What’s up? 
Chandler, You know…Oh My God.
Monica, What happened to your teeth.
Ross, I whitened them.
Chandler,  Really.
Ross, Yeah. What do you think.
Monica, Well  I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
Ross, Come on  seriously.
Monica, Ross they’re really  really  really white.
Chandler, Yeah  what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
Ross, Ahh  I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
Monica, How much longer?
Ross, A-A day.
Monica, Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Ross, I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on  are they really that bad?
Chandler, No  no no no. You’ll be fine.  Hillary’s bind  right?
Monica, She will be after tonight.
Chandler, Yeah. 
Ross, Oh  hey  hey Rach  do you notice anything..ahh…
Rachel, Yeah. Your teeth? Yes  I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But  Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Chandler, What???
Monica, Oh my god.
Rachel, Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is  now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
Chandler, I am proud of all my friends today.
Monica, My God  Rachel  I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh  I’m so jealous. 
Chandler, Hi  I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy
Monica, Chandler  please  come on. Look at him. 
Chandler, Oh  I am no women  but that is one tasty dish. 
Phoebe, Hey. Here.  Ohh  who’s the silver fox?
Rachel, That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him?  Oh wait. Ohh  Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Phoebe, That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Yeah  no  Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Rachel, Oh My God  Phoebe  that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
Phoebe, What?
Rachel, Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her  she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Phoebe, Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Rachel, To get you to make out with him!!!
Phoebe, Ohhh.
Monica,  Okay  maybe this will make your teeth look less white.  Nope. Okay  colors that don’t work are blue  yellow  green  red  black  white  orange  and purple.
Ross, I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Monica, Hey Ross  maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.
Ross, Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Monica, I’m just saying  if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
Ross, Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
Monica, Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Ross, But  won’t she notice I have makeup on?
Monica, Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Ross, What??
Monica, All right  half the people. I mean  just try it and see.
Ross, No. I am not putting on makeup. 
Phoebe, Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Monica, Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.
Chandler, Yes  God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
Monica, Wait  we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
Chandler, Yes  but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
Monica, You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right  I’m sorry.
Chandler, Nah  Nah  it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know  do kind of like a man thing.
Monica, Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
Chandler, You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Monica, When girls hang out  we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear.  I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.
Joey, Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.
Chandler, No thanks  Josephine.
Chandler, Hey Ross  I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Rachel, Ohh  hi  Kim.
Rachel, Yeah  remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.
Rachel, Okay  two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well  it turns out that’s not true.
Rachel, No.
Rachel, Oh no  no  no. Oh God  you think I made out with him.
Rachel, I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. 
Ross, Mmm-Hmm.
Ross, Mmm.
Ross, Mm-Hmm.
Ross,  Hmm-Hmm.
Ross, Mmm-Unmm.
Ross, Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I  uh  am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um  I  um  have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But  but  let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
Joey, So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan  your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Monica, Oh my God  Joey  that is such a great tip.
Chandler, Monica  could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Monica, Okay. Oh but Joey  come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Joey, Ohh  I love birds. 
Chandler, What is the matter with you ?!?
Joey, What?
Chandler, You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture  a picture  of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Joey, Hey. Hey look I am still Joey  okay. Flowers they’re just  you know  they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
Chandler, You’re turning into a women.
Joey, No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
Chandler, Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
Joey, It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God  I’m a women!!!
Rachel, Now  she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Phoebe, But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
Rachel, I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Phoebe, Well  hey  what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh  did she ever think of that?
Rachel, You were with Kenny today  weren’t you?
Phoebe, Just for a second.
Rachel, Ohh  Phoebe  what am I going to do?
Phoebe, Well  the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Rachel, I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean  I could  but I wouldn’t.
Phoebe, Ohh  sleep with Kenny.
Rachel, That wouldn’t help me.
Phoebe, Ohh  yes it would.
Ross, Mmm.
Ross,  Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Me  neither. I’ve had a really good time too  you know. 
Ross,  Ohh  I just like the smell.  Mmmm.
Ross, Hmm-Hmm.
Ross, Mmm-Hmm. 
Ross,  How about all the way.
Ross,  Wow  cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster?  So  ahh  where were we?
Ross, Ohh  you can see them  huh?
Ross, I-I  did that for you.
Ross, What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
Rachel, Kim  hi.
Rachel, Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
Rachel,"  Yeah  he dumped me. He said  ""Rachel  I can’t do this. Even though you are a very  very  very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry."" And then I don’t know why but he said  ""and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim  who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."""
Rachel, Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.
Rachel, You and Ralph?
Joey, Hey  uhh  I need to talk to you.
Joey, I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I  uh  I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place  okay? That’s just the way it has to be.
Joey, Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean  I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this  you know.  You could  uh  put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean  if you want to.
Joey, And  uhh  maybe the watering can there.
Joey, And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey,  Okay.
Monica,  Okay  great!  Bye.  So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
Chandler, Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
Monica,  I miss Rachel.  No  my parents.
Chandler, Oh! That’s great  they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
Monica, Yeah  and y’know  if you could not mention to them that we live together  that would be great!   I was thinking we would eat around four.
Chandler,  Why can’t I tell them that we live together?
Monica, Because they don’t know we’re dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
Chandler, Why haven’t you told them?!
Monica, Um  well  I was going to  I-I-I really was. But um  then somewhere  just out of nowhere  I didn’t.
Chandler, Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!
Monica,  So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. 
Chandler, Why wouldn’t they be happy?
Monica, Well  um  because mainly  um  they don’t like you. I’m sorry.
Chandler, What? What? Why?!
Monica, Maybe because you used to be aloof  or that you’re really sarcastic  or that  y’know  you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Chandler, Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?
Monica, Look  I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.
Chandler, Y’know  it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over  I will be all charming  I will make them fall in love with me  and then we’ll tell ‘em.
Monica, You really think that’ll work?
Chandler, Hey  I can be pretty charming  babe  I won YOU over  didn’t I?
Monica,  I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!
Chandler, Hey!  Oh  good  Ross! You’re parents like me  right?
Ross,  Yes  of course they like you!
Chandler, Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
Ross,  Yeah  they don’t like you.
Chandler,  Do you know why?
Ross, I dunno  maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-
Chandler,  Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
Chandler, This is great  another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Joey, Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up  eh?
Chandler, Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Joey, Well maybe I love ya’.
Chandler, .
Chandler, Hey.
Ross,  No I don’t want to play video games  Joey!
Joey, Yeah! Yeah  why? What’s up?
Ross, For real?
Joey, Ye-ye  we go to yours!
Ross, Yeah  see  we-we-we have to stop across the hall  because it’s my sister. But  uh  uh y’know actually  growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah  you-you should tell your friends that.
Joey, How you got three women to marry you  I’ll never know.
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey! Hey  Pheebs  check it out. Yeah  for my desert  I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Phoebe, Wow  that sounds great! And what are you making Monica  in case Rachel’s dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!
Monica, Nothing.
Rachel,  Nothing?
Monica, No  sweetie  I-I trust you.
Rachel, So  if-if I mess this up  there’s nothing else for dessert?
Monica, You’re not gonna mess it up.
Rachel, Wow  Monica  I love that  you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question  how do you know when uh  the butter’s done?
Monica, Well  it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Joey, Oh  ooh the food smells great  Mon!
Ross, And the place looks so nice!
Joey, Yeah  hey hey  Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Ross, Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey, Well  this has been great!
Ross, See ya!
Monica, Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?
Ross, Oh  oh  we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
Monica, Oh  Janine  the really hot dancer girl?
Ross, Some would say she’s attractive  yes.
Phoebe, And who else is going to be there?
Joey, Uh  some of her friends  yeah.
Rachel, Her dancer friends?
Joey,  Yes  all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be  be drinkin’ and dancin  and we really wanna go!
Ross,  Dude  we were good!
Monica, You’re not gonna go anywhere  you said you were gonna eat here  and you’re gonna eat here!
Phoebe, Yeah  and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Ross, Oh  but-but it is  uh  it’s just like the first Thanksgiving  when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh  sat down to dinner.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Monica, Dad   Mom . Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!
Chandler, Mr. and Mrs. Geller  you look wonderful  it is great to have you hear  let us take off your coats!
Chandler, Whoa  snowing out there?
Monica, Dad  Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
Phoebe, Rach  Rach  I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Rachel, Really?!
Phoebe," Yeah  I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know  I mean he used to be just  y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller  dream hunk."""
Rachel, I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller  walks in while you’re changing.”
Monica, Y’know dad  Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!
Chandler, Yeah  Ross sure is a great guy  y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Chandler,  He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Joey, Rach  you’re killin’ us here  will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
Rachel,  Look at it  isn’t it beautiful?
Ross, Yeah  yeah  what is it?
Rachel, It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers  then a layer of jam  then custard  which I made from scratch   then raspberries  more ladyfingers  then beef sauteed with peas and onions   then a little more custard  and then bananas  and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Ross, W-What was the one right before bananas?
Rachel, The beef? Yeah  that was weird to me  too. But then  y’know  I thought “well  there’s mincemeat pie ” I mean that’s an English dessert  these people just put very strange things in their food  y’know.  Oh! by the way  can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Joey, Y-sure!
Rachel,  And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
Ross, Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no  there is no way!
Joey, I know  and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
Ross, Oh my God  the pages are stuck together!
Joey,  Chandler!
Ross, Oh My God  she-she made half a English Trifle  and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!
Joey,  Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
Ross, No  no  we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.
Joey, Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Ross, Yeah  it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
Joey,  Vomiting stories are funny...
Rachel, Joey  God  your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
Joey, Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
Rachel, No!
Joey,  Still not hot enough!
Phoebe, Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Okay  look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn’t give to be that can of  condensed milk.
Monica, Mom  uh  Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Chandler, Oh  yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight  I don’t mean tight  I mean it’s not too tight  not that I was looking at-
Chandler,  What?
Monica,  What?
Ross,  Dude  I need to talk to you a sec.
Ross, Okay  I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.
Chandler, You do? Why?
Ross, Okay  remember  we were young. Hey  Spring break  sophomore year  I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
Chandler, What?! Why did you do that?
Ross, I don’t know  aheh  your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head  I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.
Chandler, How could it not matter?!
Ross, How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college  let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
Chandler, What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
Ross, I don’t know  I-I was all high.
Monica, Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!
Chandler, Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Monica, Ross  I can’t believe you’d do that!
Chandler, The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me  okay? So will you fix this?
Ross, Okay  okay  I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
Monica, You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!
Ross, Alright  alright  now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Monica, Dad  please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright  and if you’re gonna put your feet up  why don’t you sit on the-
Phoebe, Monica  leave him alone!
Joey,  Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?
Rachel,  No  I did  but tell me again  because it’s so romantic.
Joey, Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?
Rachel, Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes  alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh  remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
Rachel, So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it  alright?
Joey, Oh I am!
Monica, Ross  if you don’t tell them  then I will!
Ross, Okay  fine!
Joey, Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Ross, Oh  uh  can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
Joey, Okay  look  I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
Ross, What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving  not...Truth-Day!
Joey, Look  when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing  they’re all gonna’ make fun of her  do you want that?
Ross, Okay  okay  we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! 
Joey,  Dude  they’re not objects.
Joey, Just kiddin ’ I’ll talk to them  you distract Rach.
Ross, Hey Rach  can I talk to you outside for a second?
Rachel, Okay...
Rachel, What’s up  Ross?
Ross, So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us  hm?
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, And um...You look nice today.
Rachel, Oh no. No Ross  don’t do this.
Ross, What?
Rachel, I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.
Ross,  Eh?
Rachel, I thought this might happen today. Ross  I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
Ross,  You’re alone.
Rachel, No  I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re  alone  alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.
Ross,  Ah well  can’t blame a guy for trying!
Joey, Oh and  Okay  and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it  I learned something in acting class  try uh  rubbing your stomach  or uh  or saying “mmm” and uh  oh oh! And smiling   okay?
Chandler, Yeah  I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Joey, Rachel  there you are! Come on  let’s serve that dessert already!
Rachel, Joey  you’re gonna have to stop rushing me  you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
Joey,  Really?
Rachel, No  I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay  everybody  it’s trifle time!
Phoebe, So  now  Rach  this is a traditional English trifle  isn’t it?
Rachel, It sure is.
Phoebe, Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Rachel, Beef.
Phoebe, I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat.  Ohhh no.
Rachel, Alright  Monica  I want you to have the first taste.
Monica, Really?
Rachel, Oh oh oh  wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Op! Wait  you dropped a pea.
Rachel, Well?
Monica,  Mmmm! It’s good!
Rachel, Really? How good?
Monica, It’s so good  that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it  that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Chandler,  Yeah  this is so good  that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
Monica,  I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror  as I eat it.
Rachel, Okay  now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
Ross, Wha? No no! Ah!   All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
Ross, It tastes like feet!
Joey, I like it.
Ross, Are you kidding?
Joey, What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Rachel, ...So a bird just grabbed it  and then tried to fly away with it and  and then just dropped it on the street?
Chandler,  Yes  but if it’s any consolation  before the bird dropped it  he seemed to enjoy it.
Phoebe, Rachel  come here.  Okay  I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap  and I had another dream about Jack.
Rachel, Oh  Phoebe  do I wanna hear this?
Phoebe, I dunno  let’s see! So  okay  I dreamt that we were gonna get married  and he left  becuz he had to go fight a fire. And  um  so okay  I went to a night club  and I saw him making out with a girl.
Rachel,  Oh my God  he dream-cheated on you!
Phoebe, Yeah  but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then  he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse  who  by the way  was totally coming on to me  and please  that is not gonna happen.
Phoebe, Five minutes ago  a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well  not nothing  I am still a woman.
Monica, Ross? Let’s go.
Ross, Oh yeah  about telling Mom and Dad  I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Monica, Alright  you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.
Ross, Wha-what?
Monica,  Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
Ross,   You are such a tattletale! Mom  Dad  you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Ross, Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
Monica, And Dad  y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!
Ross, Yeah  well  Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing  Monica did!
Monica, Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!
Ross, Monica and Chandler are living together!
Monica, Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
Phoebe,  I love Jacques Cousteau!
Rachel,  I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Joey,  I wanna gooooooo!
Ross, I-I uh  I got tricked into all those things!
Chandler, Thank you!
Chandler,  I’ll talk to them!
Rachel, You guys! It was bananas  cream  and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!
Monica, Well actually  I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.
Joey, No it isn’t  I ate that.
Joey, Nope  got it and I got yours  too.
Chandler, Let me ask you  why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Rachel, That’s a good story  Grandpa.
Ross, Hey
Ross, Wow  Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Monica, Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.
Phoebe, That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
Chandler, I dunno what it is  it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.
Monica, Oh  here.
Chandler, See now it feels like Christmas!
Ross, … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now  some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians  who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year  symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.
Rachel, So  pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Joey, Hey you guys.
Chandler, Hey Joe what’s up?
Joey, I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know  everywhere I look she’s like… 
Chandler, I can see why that’s hard to resist.
Joey, I like her so much!
Monica, Aw  I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.
Joey, I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
Chandler, You are aware that she’s not a monkey  right?
Ross, I am so over Janine. I mean  yeah  at first I thought she was hot  but now she’s like OLD NEWS!
Ross, Hi Janine!
Monica, Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?
Monica, Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Chandler, Ah  you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you? 
Ross, You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!
Joey, Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.
Ross, Oh  well you see how it works is  the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live  but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah  not a lot of people know that.
Ross, Are you serious?
Monica, We are there!
Chandler, What  what are you laughing at?
Rachel, Well  I used to date him  but you’re still going out with her!
Ross, Bye Janine!
Joey, Did she just ask me out on a date?
Chandler, I don’t think so.
Monica, What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Rachel, Yeah  but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah  honey  I’m sorry  but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.
Joey, Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party  right? So at midnight  I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back  great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude  what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me  it was New Years!’
Rachel, Well  that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School  and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
Ross, It was a dry day.
Monica, We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!
Ross, Oh my God!
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler,  Oh my God!
Joey, OK  listen I’ve been on sets before  so let me give you a little advice  alright? It’s a show  but we’re just dancing  OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.
Ross, Got it!
Ross, Oh my God it’s just like I dreamed it!
Ross, Yeah  I have a question. When is this gonna air?
Joey, Ross! So when is it gonna air?
Rachel, Okay  you look in the kitchen  I will look in the back closet.
Chandler, I can save you time ladies  I’m right here.
Phoebe, Yeah  Chandler why don’t you take a walk? This doesn’t concern you.
Rachel, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler, What? That’s terrible!
Phoebe, No-no  we do it every year!
Chandler, Oh well  that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe, No  yeah  we never find them! She’s always best at us that wily minx.
Rachel, Don’t worry  we’re just gonna search here for an hour  them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search  OK?
Chandler, No not okay  you can’t look for Monica’s presents!
Phoebe, But we have to!
Chandler, No  you don’t have to  and you can’t because I live here too.
Phoebe, Well then  you should look with us.
Chandler, Why?
Rachel, Chandler  aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Chandler, No  I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe, Oh  that’s it?  A great idea!
Rachel, Chandler  that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present  two medium presents  and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler, If I help  we can find ‘em faster!
Rachel, That’s right!
Phoebe, Ooh ooh  we have a live one!
Rachel, Oh  it’s a Macy’s bag!
Phoebe, Ooh  who’s it for?
Rachel,  Dear losers  do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler  I knew they’d break you.
Phoebe, Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
Rachel, We are so gonna find them this year.
Chandler, Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look  you don’t  you don’t do that every year do you?
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, You don’t  like go into the back of my closet  and look under my gym bag or anything?
Chandler, Because that’s where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I’ve never seen before in my life! Okay  that did not just happen! 
Monica, Okay  here comes another camera.
Ross, Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Ross, Why do they keep doing that?
Monica, If we wanna get on camera  I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.
Ross, Right.
Ross, Hey  what’d you guys do to get up on there?
Monica, Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, Really?
Joey, What do you mean?
Joey, Uh-huh.
Joey, No-no-no-no-no we came together!
Joey, No-no hey buddy  please let me dance with that girl  I really like her and I think I have a shot.
Chandler, I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey  oh hey!
Rachel, Yeah  we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Phoebe, Yeah  and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Chandler, Those are my gifts  I got them for you.
Phoebe, Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Rachel, Well Chandler  what is this very weird  metal A Z thing?
Chandler, Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Phoebe, Oh  okay  I'm sorry  thank you for my azzz.
Rachel, Ha!
Chandler, Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet  okay?
Rachel, Yes  okay  oh  by the way  I just gotta say  I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved  you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Joey, Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Here we go.  Looking good Gellers!
Ross, We know!
Monica, Hey  see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.
Ross, Okay.
Monica, Excuse me  sir  would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?
Ross, Monica!  Would it?
Joey, Hey! Tall guy! Hey  listen  I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  okay. Uh  look buddy  I came with that girl  and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over  so I was wondering if..
Joey, Oh come on man  you can dance with my partner  she’s real  uh  mellow!
Joey, Well  I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…
Joey, Alright  alright  hey y’know fair is fair   if you’re right  you’re right  what can I say  but hey oh no! 
Joey, Hey  now you’re the one who wet his pants. 
Monica, Man  this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous  I mean  who’s gonna be the losers then?
Ross, Hey  I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
Monica, What?
Ross, The routine!
Monica, Ross  we haven’t done the routine since middle school.
Ross, Hey  when the snippy guy sees the routine  he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
Monica, Was it really that good?
Ross, We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look  it’s almost fake midnight  do we really have any other choice?
Monica, Okay  let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Monica, 5 6 7 8!
Ross, So  do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
Monica, Yes! 
Joey, Uh  take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean  I know you told us to show excitement  but don’t you think he went a little overboard?
Joey, Yeah  take a hike wetpants!
Ross, Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
Monica, I know! Hey  you haven’t been practising the routine  have you?
Ross, No!
Monica, Me too!
Ross, Hey  when the music starts up again  I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot  y’know? 
Monica, Ross  I think we should stick to the routine  we don’t wanna look stupid!
Joey, No! Year! Happy No Year!
Phoebe, Hey! Look who I found!
Chandler, Oh  hey guys!
Phoebe, Y’know  birds have a very good sense of direction  and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Chandler, Yes  if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Phoebe, Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay  c’mon guys  show us where the presents are!
Chandler, Oh  the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm  I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
Phoebe, Hmm  how about my azzz?
Rachel, Hey  this is hollow.
Phoebe, What?
Rachel, This bench  it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh  the presents!!!
Phoebe, No  don’t look directly at them!
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, Alright  no  we could look at them!
Rachel, Oh  this one’s for me!
Phoebe, Oh  this one’s for Chandler. Here.
Chandler, Oh great!
Phoebe, And the big one’s for me!
Rachel, Ooh  let’s open them!
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay!
Phoebe, Hee hee!
Chandler, Wait  we can’t do this.
Chandler, I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean  look  I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present  and wanting to surprise me  and you guys are gonna ruin that  and I  look we have to put these back  this is not what Christmas is about.
Rachel, Whatever Linus  I’m opening mine.
Chandler, Nobody is opening anything ok? Look  I don’t know about you guys  but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present  and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please  please  can we just  can we put them back?
Phoebe, Will you get us better gifts?
Chandler, Fine!
Monica, Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler  you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Chandler, That’s what you got me?
Phoebe, Oh yes  I see what you mean. That look is priceless.
Joey, Home sweet home  huh? Nice to  uh  get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic  y’know? Anyway  g’night!
Joey, Yeah?
Joey, Oh  yoii. What was that for?
Joey, Really? In the moment  I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
Joey, But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
Joey, No.
Joey, 3  2 
Joey, Uh  yeah  okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.
Monica, We were on the platform  ready to dance the world into the new Millennium  and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’
Rachel, Uh  wait  so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Monica, Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey  by the way  great thinking about catching me!
Rachel, ‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
Monica, What? We could do it!
Ross, I don’t know  I mean you were a lot bigger  I mean  stronger back then.
Monica, I can do it  okay? Come on  let’s go. 
Monica, I can’t do it! 
Chandler, Now you do that  you’re on TV.
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Listen  do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Monica, Honey  we have been through this before!
Rachel, Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
Phoebe, She’s made it pretty clear  it is not going to happen.
Joey, Well all right then  I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!
Monica, You serious?!
Chandler, That’s great!
Monica, Really?!
Phoebe, Yeah well  we’ll see.
Ross, You kissed her.
Joey, Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Chandler, So you kissed her  so what happened after that?
Joey, I came over here to tell you guys.
Chandler, So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
Joey, Okay. 
Joey, Okay. 
Joey, Okay  I’m all right  okay  but hey  could you just leave your lips? 
Monica, Bye. 
Joey, Have you kissed her yet? It’s awesome! I could do it forever! Y’know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
Monica, I am so glad you said cooks.
Rachel, I know.
Chandler,  Oh hey Rachel  sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. 
Rachel, Oh-oh  Pottery Barn!  You can throw the rest away.
Chandler, I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
Rachel, Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. 
Monica, You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Rachel, Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Chandler, A pharmacist. 
Monica, Rach  Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Joey, I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Chandler, You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Joey,  I was tired!
Rachel, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Monica, Yeah  she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history  a story behind it.
Rachel, Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Monica, It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm  y’know uh  what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Joey, Hey! I made that for her!
Chandler, You made pottery?
Joey, Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Monica, I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.
Rachel, Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table  she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Chandler, Ahh  just like the apothecary tables of yore…
Chandler," …so then the farmer says  ""That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it."" "
Monica, I am so glad you guys got together  Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Chandler, Look at us  we’re a couple of couples!
Monica, Yeah.
Joey, And Chandler I can’t believe I let you pay for this one.  Thanks man.
Monica, So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I’ll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
Joey, Oh  but hey look  at least let us bring the wine.
Monica, Joey  you don’t have too!
Joey, Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right?
Chandler, Yeah all right.  Okay  good night guys.
Joey, See ya tomorrow!
Monica, Tomorrow!
Joey, What?
Joey, What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Joey, Blah?!
Joey, Uh  they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.
Joey, I guess.
Joey, If you want  I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe,  Ooh  what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Rachel, Guess!
Phoebe, Umm  a flea market?
Rachel, Ha! See  I knew  I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
Phoebe, Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
Rachel, Ohh  yes.
Phoebe, Y’know? Ooh  you can almost smell the opium.
Rachel, Almost.
Phoebe, How much was it?
Rachel, It was only 500 bucks.
Phoebe, 500 bucks at a flea market?!
Rachel, Oh  okay see I thought  I thought you meant how much was it when it was new  y’know like back then.
Phoebe, Oh no.
Rachel, Yeah no  I mean it was at a flea market  so it was y’know  it was like a dollar.
Phoebe, A dollar?
Rachel, And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Phoebe, Ohh  okay  they gave you the old time pricing.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Well  what period is it from?
Rachel, Uh  it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
Phoebe, Yes  yes I do. God  oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…
Rachel, Yes! That I know  this is from White Plains.
Phoebe,  White Plains. Oh  it sounds like such a magical place.
Rachel, Hey! We’re here!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel,  Ohh! Oh my God!
Ross, You like it?
Rachel, Oh no!
Ross, It’s my new apothecary table!
Rachel, Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second  she cannot see this!
Ross, Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
Rachel, I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
Ross, Why did you do that?
Rachel, Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ross, She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Rachel, I know! I know  she says it’s all mass-produced  nothing is authentic  and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on  she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
Ross, What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh  although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! 
Rachel, Ooo! Oh  I forgot they made sheets!
Ross, Uh  yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Rachel, Ross  get over it! It’s not like she hates you.
Ross, Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
Rachel, Ross  she’s not weird  she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Ross, Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Ooh  Phoebe’s here! Okay  let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!
Phoebe, Okay. Hey—Ooh  cool sheets! 
Ross, Oh  you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Phoebe, Sure!
Rachel, He got it a flea market!
Phoebe, You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on  you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Monica, Hey!
Joey, Hi!
Monica, The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Chandler, And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it  because you paid dinner last night.
Joey, Thanks. Thanks  but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.
Monica, What happened to Janine?
Joey, Oh  she’s uh-uh really sick.
Chandler, Oh that’s too bad.
Joey, Yeah  she’s been in there all day   uh high fever  a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
Joey, ‘Kay!
Chandler, That’s funny  I saw no phlegm.
Joey, No-no  she really is sick!
Chandler, Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Joey, Uh  y’know  starve a fever  go to a play for a cold.
Monica, Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Joey, Well uh  she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.
Chandler, Well  why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Joey, Because she uh  she-she thinks that you are blah and that you  Monica  are too loud.
Monica,  What?!!  What?
Chandler, So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Monica, Ugh  I can not believe this! I mean  who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Chandler, And I am not blah  I am a hoot!
Joey, I know! I know! Come on  please-please you guys  don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just  she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus  she’s really sick!
Chandler, No  you sh—No you said you made that up!!
Joey, I know  but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
Chandler, Eh  they’re both good. I generally just go with  Monica’s drunk again. 
Joey, Come on you guys  come on please-please just give her another chance  huh? She’ll come around I promise.
Monica, Of course we will  come on we gotta make dinner.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  I do not like that woman!
Joey,  I can hear you!
Monica, I am loud!
Rachel, That’s funny. 
Ross, Hey Pheebs  could you please not put your feet up on my new……old sheet?
Phoebe, Oh sure!  Noo!
Rachel, Ohh!!
Ross, My apothecary table!!!
Phoebe, What?!
Rachel, Noooooo!! 
Phoebe, Ross  where did you get this?!
Ross, I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Rachel, Oh my God  Phoebe  Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Phoebe, Wow! Oh my God  well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Rachel, Oh yes.
Phoebe, Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
Ross, Of course not  it smells like wine  which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Phoebe, Oh Ross  calm down  I’ll give you the 80 cents. 
Chandler, Okay  one more time.
Monica, Chandler  would you like some more orange juice?
Chandler, Perfect decibel.
Monica,  I know!!!
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, So uh  what are you guys doing?
Chandler, Oh nothing  we’re just talking. Y’know  blah-blah-blah.
Joey, Look  come on you guys  you said you were gonna try! All right look  I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Monica, Well  I’d like to but   I’m not sure we have time to go.
Joey, Ha-ha  very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Monica, We owe you?!
Joey, That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months  and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Monica, We didn’t give you any money! 
Joey, You don’t think I know that!
Rachel, …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair  the Sahara desk  or the Parker console table.
Ross, Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
Rachel, I know  I know. I went a little crazy.
Ross, A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey.
Phoebe,  Oh Ross no. Be careful  that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Ross,  Fascinating.
Phoebe,  Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Rachel, Oh it does  it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Phoebe, Ah!
Ross, Hmm  a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey  what are some other time periods Rachel? 
Rachel, Well there’s yore. And uh  y’know  yesteryear.
Phoebe, Yeah no  I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross  y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should  you should ask Rachel to help.
Rachel, Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.
Phoebe, Oh  come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of  what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Ross, Really?!  Hey  y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need  uh ooh  here’s-here’s 60 bucks  why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Rachel,  Y’know what? I don’t  I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.
Phoebe, No! I do want to!
Rachel, Oh  she does want to.
Ross, She does want to.
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, Pheebs  I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Phoebe, Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Uck  look at this! Pottery Barn  yuck!
Rachel, Yeah  y’know what? Don’t look at it.  Seriously  don’t look at it. 
Phoebe, No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
Rachel, Ugh  those bastards! Let’s go.
Phoebe, That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
Rachel, No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe  ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the…  We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know  on the other side.
Phoebe, Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff  Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Rachel, Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did  I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.
Phoebe, No-no-no  but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
Rachel, Well then honey  buy the lamp! Hey  we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Phoebe, I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
Rachel, What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!
Phoebe, But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
Rachel,  Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe, Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
Rachel, That’s right!
Phoebe, But at least the apothecary table is real.
Joey, Well  this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?
Chandler, That’s totally understandable.
Monica, Don’t worry about it.
Chandler, Oh yeah!
Monica, Absolutely!
Joey, Oh well then  good night!
Monica, Good night! 
Joey, See? Eh  wasn’t that fun?
Monica,  I knew it!! Y’know  you’re not so quiet yourself  missy!
Chandler," And I’m blah? Listen  the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it   ""Oh Chandler  I just lost myself in the moment."""
Monica,  All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!
Joey, All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!  You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! 
Chandler,  Y’know I think you can take her.
Monica,  You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!! 
Joey, All right  uh  we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.
Joey, I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time  I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just  it just can’t work. It can’t.  I’m very upset.
Joey, Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. 
Monica, What did I tell you about the hall?!
Monica, Well  I know that would make Joey happy  so  I would like that too.
Monica, Now come on.  Well  I’m glad we worked things out.
Monica, Okay.
Monica, Bye. 
Monica,  That’s it big girl!  Come on!
Monica,  You’d better run!
Chandler, Did you hear that?
Joey, Yeah uh  what am I gonna do?
Chandler, Yeah  I’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
Joey, Yeah! 
Ross, Hey!
Joey, How ya doin’?
Chandler, Hey so  did uh  did she move out?
Joey, Pretty much  yeah.
Monica, I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Joey, Well  when it’s not right  you know it.
Chandler, You okay?
Joey, Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.
Ross, Y’know what would cheer you up?
Joey, What?
Ross, I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night  I think you should come.
Joey,  You’re right! That did cheer me up!
Ross, Hey  you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!
Phoebe, I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
Ross, Yeah  they print jokes  interviews  hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.
Monica, That didn’t work on mom  it’s not going to work on us.
Ross,  Here  check it out. It’s the first one  too.
Chandler, That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
Ross, What?
Chandler, I made that joke up.
Ross, Uh  oh-oh  no you didn’t. I did.
Chandler, Yes  I did. I told it to Dan at work  and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
Ross, Hey  tell Dan  ‘Thanks.’
Ross, What?
Rachel, I’m sorry  I was just reading the joke below it. Man  that one is funny. 
Chandler, Monica  you remember me telling you that joke  right?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Seriously?
Monica, Well  you tell a lot of jokes!
Ross, Look  Chandler  it’s my joke. But  hey  if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name  so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit  right?
Chandler, Yeah  I guess.
Joey,  Hey guys.
Chandler,  Hey  Joey  Playboy printed my joke.
Ross, No  it’s my joke  it’s mine. You can call them  they’ll tell you.
Chandler, It’s my joke.
Ross, It’s my joke.
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there  right?
Chandler, Dude  you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time  and I think they may break up.
Joey, Let’s go watch it at your place.
Chandler, Nah  Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on  I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.
Joey, Chandler  Chandler  y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
Chandler, What? No  I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?
Joey, No  that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you  the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…
Chandler, Joey  why is your cable out?
Joey, I uh  oh! Because  uh  I haven’t really paid the bill
Chandler, If you need money  will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
Joey, No  Chandler. Look  forget about it  okay? Look  I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh  was she hot.
Chandler, Whoa ho.
Joey, I know! Yeah  but  look I can handle it. All right? Look  I can listen to the radio  huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
Chandler,  All right  you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Joey, Sure.
Chandler,  Paid your phone bill?
Joey, Not so much.
Phoebe,  Hey.
Monica,  It’s only you.
Phoebe, Wh-wh-what are you doing?
Rachel, We are looking at a Playboy.
Phoebe, Oh  I want to look too! . Yikes!
Monica, So do you think that these pictures—Are  are they trying to tell a story?
Rachel, Oh  yeah  sure. I mean  like in the case of this young woman  she has lost her clothes  so she rides naked on the horse  she’s crying out  ‘Where are they  where are they?’
Monica, Well  she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah. Aw  remember the days when you used to go out to the barn  lift up your shirt  and bend over?
Rachel, You see  now  I would date this girl. She’s cute  she’s outdoorsy  you know  and she knows how to build a fire. I mean  that’s got to come in handy
Monica, Okay  I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date  who would it be?
Rachel,  I don’t know.
Monica, Me neither.
Phoebe, Rachel.
Monica, What?!
Phoebe, I don’t know.  Me neither.
Joey, You forget how many great songs Heart had.
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross, You know  Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
Chandler, So  you heard it  you repeated it  so that must mean you wrote it.
Joey, Oh  you guys  with this joke. I gotta say  I know I cracked up  but I’m not even sure I got it.
Ross, What  you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Chandler, And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
Chandler,  You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Ross, Your joke? Well  I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree  which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Chandler, So  you stole my joke  and you stole my money.
Ross, Well  I was going to stick it in the ATM  but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Chandler, Well  she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Ross, Oh  what are you going to do  follow me down there?
Chandler, Yeah!
Ross, Well  I’m not going to go now anyway .
Chandler, Okay .
Joey, Ah  Gunther  I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working  so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh  payin’ for stuff.
Joey, Uh  I don’t know. Ya see  it’s just  see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this  I just… Plus  I’d have to wait on all my friends.
Joey, What?!
Joey, Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
Monica,  She picked Rachel. I mean  she tried to back out of it  but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
Chandler,  He took my joke  he took it.
Monica, It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.
Chandler, You know who else picked Rachel? Ross  and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Monica, That’s a good idea.
Chandler, Yeah!
Monica, Do you know what’s a bad idea?
Chandler, Picking Rachel.
Monica, That’s right.  Did you hear something?
Chandler, Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Monica, It’s coming from the living room.
Joey,  I finished my book. 
Monica,  Hey  you guys.
Monica,  Oh  don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.
Rachel, Monica  what are you doing?
Monica,  Nothing  I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.  Remember  when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.
Phoebe, I guess it was kinda funny.
Monica,  It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?
Phoebe, Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!
Monica, That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay  prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!
Phoebe, No  okay  you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
Rachel,  Well  people are different.
Phoebe, Ya  you know  Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know  you can just walk all over her.
Rachel, What? Wait a minute. What are you saying  that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.
Phoebe, Oh  okay   you’re not a pushover.
Rachel, Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait  watch this  you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong  that’s what I think. Come on  Monica  let’s go to lunch. 
Monica,  You start working on that list. 
Rachel, I cannot believe her.
Monica, I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Rachel, Oh  oh  I love that Japanese place.
Monica, I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
Rachel, All right  wherever you wanna go is cool.
Monica, All right.
Ross,  Oh  hey  Gunther  check this out.
Joey, Hey Ross  listen  you want anything to drink  ‘cause I’m heading up there.
Ross, Uh  yeah  I’ll take a coffee. Thanks  man.
Joey, Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
Rachel, No.
Monica, No  thank you.
Joey,  You guys need anything  ‘cause I’m heading up there.
Joey, You got it.
Monica, Joey  what are you doing?
Joey, Just being friendly. 
Rachel, Joey  honey  I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
Joey, Nah  it’s okay. Right  Gunther? 
Joey, Okay  but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Monica, Joey  do you work here?
Joey, No.
Joey, Yeah?
Monica, Joey  what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?
Joey, It’s kind of embarrassing  y’know. I mean  I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.
Chandler, So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
Joey, I mean  the job’s easy and the money’s good  you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it  right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Rachel, Come on  Joey  I did it and it was fine.
Ross, Yeah  why would it be weird? Hey  Joey  can I get some coffee?
Joey, Okay  I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.
Ross, Seriously  I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
Joey, See  now it’s weird again.
Chandler, I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money  and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha  2:15  coffeehouse.
Rachel, Well  you know what? This is great. Finally  I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all  the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey, Thanks  Rach. Look  you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now  how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.
Ross, Joey  seriously  can I get my coffee?
Joey, Oh  I’m sorry  Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait  I’ll toss in a free muffin.
Rachel, Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, So  maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Rachel, Yes  we are very sorry to tell you this  but you  Phoebe  are flaky.
Monica, Hah!
Phoebe, That true  I am flaky.
Rachel, So  what  you’re just  you’re just okay with being flaky?
Phoebe, Yeah  totally.
Monica, Well  then  I’m okay with being high maintenance.
Rachel, Yeah  and I am okay with being a pushover.
Phoebe, That’s great. Good for you guys.
Monica, I am not high maintenance!
Rachel, I am not a pushover!
Phoebe, Who said you were?
Phoebe, Oh  I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
Joey, Hey  Gunther. Can you uh  can you cover for me? I just got an audition.
Joey, Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man  it’s a great part. Look  check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry  that seat’s saved.’
Joey, Okay  maybe he’s not his best friend  but …
Joey, Oh  man  I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry  that seat is taken.’
Joey, No  no  I didn’t mean you. But  you believed me  huh?
Joey, So  you’d hire me  right?
Joey, Exactly! All right  everybody  listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
Joey, Yeah  it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.
Ross, It’s my joke.
Chandler, It’s my joke.
Ross, Y’know  I don’t think we’re going to settle this.
Chandler, Let’s have Monica decide.
Ross, Yeah!
Chandler, Yeah!
Ross, Hey Mon.
Chandler, Mon  get out here!
Ross, Monica! 
Chandler, Okay  okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica, Why do I have to decide?
Chandler, Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
Ross, Yeah  but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.
Chandler,  Don’t try to sway her.   I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay  let’s go.
Ross, We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
Monica, Okay  Chandler  you go first.
Chandler, Okay  I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Monica, Oh  wait  is he the guy I met at Christmas?
Chandler, Can I finish my story?!
Monica, Do you want me to pick you?!
Ross, See  I would never snap at you like that.
Monica, Continue.
Chandler, So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said  ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. 
Ross, Are you kidding? Okay  look. I-I studied evolution. Remember  evolution? Monkey into man? Plus  I’m a doctor  and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!
Chandler, I’m not arguing with that.
Monica, All right  I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.
Monica, You are both idiots. The joke is not funny  and it’s offensive to women  and doctors  and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit  you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
Ross, It’s your joke.
Chandler, Is not.
Monica, Hi  Chandler. There you are.
Chandler, Hi  oh hi.
Monica, Hey  it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um  why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?
Chandler,  Monica is a self-sufficient  together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and——generosity of spirit.
Rachel, Wow  you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.
Phoebe, Really? I’ve heard better.
Monica, Wait  wait  he came up with that himself. Tell them  Chandler.
Chandler,  I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Monica, Look  I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!
Chandler,  You’re a little high maintenance.
Monica, Ahhh! You are on my list.
Chandler, I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going  but you’re passionate  and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things  I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So  they can say that you’re high maintenance  but it’s okay  because I like … maintaining you.
Monica,   I didn’t even tell him to say that. . All right you’re off my list.
Chandler,  I’m off the list. 
Monica,  Phoebe  it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.
Phoebe,  Y’know  suddenly I find you very attractive.
Chandler, Hey  buddy boy  how’d the audition go?
Joey, Not good  no. I didn’t get the part  and I lost my job here  so …
Phoebe, Wow! That is a bad audition.
Rachel, How-how did you lose your job here?
Joey, Well  I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So  I went anyway  and then he fired me.
Rachel, He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not  that’s not right.
Joey, Yeah  what are ya gonna do?
Rachel, Joey  you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what  I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No  I really shouldn’t say anything—No  I should say something to him.  Gunther  I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…
Rachel, What?
Rachel, That’s right  he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go  Joey  you got your job back.
Joey, That’s great. Thanks Rach.
Rachel, Yeah  pretty nice  huh? Now who’s a pushover?
Phoebe,  Rach  you’re in my seat.
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry. 
Phoebe, Hey  I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.
Monica, I pick you  Phoebe.
Rachel, Oh  yeah. Definitely you  Pheebs.
Phoebe, Yeah  well  I kinda thought.
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, Hey. Oh  I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with  who would you pick?
Ross, No way.
Joey, I’m not answering that.
Chandler, Joey!  No way. I’m not answering that.
Joey, Okay Rach  that muffin and espresso  $4.50. Ross  double latte  $2.75. Chandler  coffee and a scone  $4.25. And Pheebs  herbal tea  $1.25. So  all together that’s  $12.75.
Chandler, This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Joey, Hi!
Joey, Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, Well  he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh  I good check with him—He says it’s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
Ross, Hey Joey  how come our stuff isn’t free?
Joey, It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!
Rachel, Wait a minute  you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
Phoebe, Yeah Joey that is so gross!
Joey, How about a scone on the house baby?
Phoebe,  I’m pretty.
Ross, Hey does anyone have any gum?
Phoebe, Oh I do!  Oh  y’know what? No.  Wait a second.  I know it’s in here somewhere.
Ross, Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!
Monica,  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey  what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?
Monica,  Ugh  they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.
Chandler, I’m so sorry you’re sick.
Monica, I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Rachel, Honey  no one thinks you’re a pansy  but we do think you need a tissue. 
Monica,  I have not been sick in over three years! 
Chandler, I’m gonna grab you some tissue.
Monica, I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!
Ross, When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.
Monica, I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know  it’s a really hard word to say.
Chandler, Yes?
Rachel, Oh my God  Jill!
Chandler, Oh my God  introduce us!
Rachel, This is Chandler. 
Rachel, And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross, Hi Jill.
Rachel, And that’s Phoebe   and that’s Joey.
Joey, Hey   how you doin’?
Rachel, Don’t!!   Honey  what are you doing here?!
Phoebe,  Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?
Phoebe, Never mind  I got it.
Rachel, Wow! What did he say?
Rachel, Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.
Monica, Rach? 
Rachel, Oh yeah  sorry. Wait honey  so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Monica, You bought a boat?
Chandler, Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! 
Rachel, Jill  honey  I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it  I-I-I at first I was scared  and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay  well this is  this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job  you’re gonna get an apartment  and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs  she can stay with us?
Phoebe, Of course  yeah!
Phoebe, Ooh  I like cards.
Joey,  Are you all finished here?
Joey, Great! 
Joey, What?!
Joey, Well if it’s free food  how come you’re charging me for it?
Joey, Well  what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
Joey,  Sorry! 
Ross, Jill  how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
Ross, I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Phoebe, Seriously  I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.
Phoebe, I would love that job!
Rachel,  Hey! What’s goin’ on?
Rachel,  Jill! Did you shop?!
Rachel, You went shopping?! What  and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow  you guys are terrible!
Phoebe, Sorry Jill.
Ross, Sorry-sorry Jill.
Rachel, What’d you get?
Phoebe," Oh well  all right  I got   thank you  I got uh  this y’know ""I want a job sweater."" "
Rachel, Oh.
Phoebe, And  and then I got uh  these are apartment pants.
Rachel, Apartment pants?
Phoebe, Yeah  you never heard of them?
Rachel, No  of course  of course I’ve heard of them! Ross  what did you get?
Ross, Huh? Oh  I got this——this!
Rachel, A pajmena?
Ross, Yeah! Oh  I-I love this babies!
Rachel, Really?
Ross, Ross  wants a pajmena?
Ross, It’s a rug. 
Rachel, Jill?
Rachel, Oh  come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!
Rachel, All right  it’s okay. One little setback is okay  just don’t let it happen again  all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff  I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena.  And the uh  and the uh pants. Y’know what  I’m just gonna take it all away  ‘cause that way you’ll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty  I’m gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. 
Ross, Yeah. Everything but  the little blue one. 
Ross, Well. Hey…
Ross," Oh yeah  how about you and the   ""I’m sorry!"""
Phoebe, What about  what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants  how dumb was I?
Ross, Oh stop.
Ross, No  you stop!
Phoebe,  Okay-okay  why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!
Monica, Okay  so what do you  what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!
Chandler, I know  let’s rest and drink lots of fluids. 
Monica, Okay  I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed  then you’re coming with me.
Chandler, That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here. 
Monica,  Are you saying that you don’t wanna get with this? 
Chandler, Yeah  I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
Monica,  Come on. 
Chandler, Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.
Monica, I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either  that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
Chandler, That’s the thing  see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey.
Rachel, What’s up?!
Phoebe, Umm  I think there’s something you should maybe know.
Rachel, Well  it’d better not be about the apartment pants  because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
Phoebe, No. No. It’s just I was umm  I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm  I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe, Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing  but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
Rachel, With Ross and Jill?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, With Ross and my sister?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, Oh there is no way.
Phoebe, Okay then.
Rachel, Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone  but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God  and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible  this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill  she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God  I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister  this terrible. Oh my God  this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
Phoebe, But great news about the apartment pants  huh?
Joey, That’ll be $3.85.
Joey," It’s just I can’t because my manager said I…   ""Happy birthday to you  happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie…"
Joey,"  ""…Amy! Happy birthday to you!"""
Joey, Yeah  not it here it isn’t.
Rachel,  Oh hi! Y’know  I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Rachel, That is great. Hey  y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Rachel, Oh so you know that  you guys talked about that  so you get along  so you think you’re gonna go out?
Rachel, I just  Phoebe  said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Oh not-not so much. Umm  what-what do you  what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Rachel, Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
Rachel, No! No I  no Ross is not a geek!
Rachel, What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Rachel, Oh no-no-no  no-no-no  that’s not what I meant.
Rachel, Yeah but  he’s not your type.
Rachel, Yeah but  you don’t  you don’t  you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean  you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?
Rachel, She-she died Jill.
Monica,  Chandler!
Chandler, Oh what is it honey  you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!
Monica,  Calling Dr. Big  Dr. Big to the bed.
Chandler, Oh Jeez honey  I thought  I thought you were asleep.
Monica, How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
Chandler, I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Monica, Come on  get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel  as good as I feel. 
Chandler, Would you please get some rest!
Monica, I’m fine. 
Joey,"  ""Happy birthday to you!"""
Joey, What? No-no it’s her birthday!
Joey, But it really…
Joey, Damnit! 
Ross,  Rach? Hi!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Rachel, Well yeah…
Ross, Oh wow! I mean  wow! I mean  I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her  never!
Rachel, Really?!
Ross," Yeah but after you said it was okay  I figured  ""Why not?!"""
Rachel, Oh so-so not really never.
Ross, I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through  I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey  if you ever want to go out with Monica  you have my blessing.
Joey,  Oh-ho  and mine!
Monica,  Chandler  I think I’m sick.
Chandler, Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Monica, Okay  fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? 
Chandler, No-no-no-no-no-no-no  you are not getting me this way.
Monica, Come on! I really need your help!
Chandler, No-no-no-no-no!
Monica, Fine  I’ll rub it on myself.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, So you’re just  kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Monica, Yeah?
Chandler, It’s nice.
Monica, Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
Chandler, Yes! 
Monica, I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?
Chandler, It’s all very  very good.  So you wanna go uh  mix it up?
Monica, Not now  I’m sick!
Chandler, Oh come on you big faker!
Monica, What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Chandler, Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Monica, Okay  if you really wanna have sex…
Chandler, Okay! 
Monica, Worked like a charm.
Rachel, Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
Rachel, Well  I-I don’t like it.
Rachel, It’s kinda slutty.
Rachel, Yeah well  I’m-I’m a slut.
Ross,  Hi Jill!
Ross, Hi .
Rachel, Rachel.
Ross, Rachel! Well  you-you’re not at home  you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
Rachel, Yeah I know  and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!
Ross, Okay. So well I’ll umm   I’ll have her home by midnight.
Rachel, Why aren’t you home yet?!
Monica,  Is someone there?
Rachel, Oh yes  it’s me! Sorry!
Chandler,  What are you doing here?
Rachel, Uh  I’m just  I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?
Chandler, We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Rachel,  Oh  he brought her back to his apartment.
Monica,  Who?  Is that your sister?
Rachel, Ugh  she is a slut!
Monica, God  Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Rachel, Oh my God  look-look he’s taking off her clothes!
Chandler, He’s taking off her coat!
Rachel, Oh  this is just terrible.
Monica, Oh no it’s not  no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna…
Rachel, Oh. 
Chandler, Ho-oh  he’s gonna get some!  Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Y’know so umm  he’s closed the drapes there so he can have a nice  pleasant conversation with your little sister.  Well  I’m off to bed! 
Joey,  Oh  uh  hey Rach. I uh  I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait  I don’t have to lie to you  you don’t live here anymore. Uh  I’m eating their food. What are you doing?
Rachel, Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Joey, Whoa  I didn’t know we could date your sister!
Monica, Joey we know you steal our food.
Chandler, I’m good.
Monica,  Oh  are the drapes still closed hon?
Rachel, Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Chandler,  Is that a swing?
Rachel, Oh don’t even ask!
Chandler, Yuck!
Joey, I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Chandler, That was like 5 years ago.
Joey, Yeah you got 5 years left!
Chandler, Joey…
Joey, You wanna make it 6?!
Rachel, Oh Ross  hi! Hey  how are ya? There you are!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel,  I’ll take a coffee.  So how was your big date last night?
Ross, Uhh  it was okay. Yeah  it was fun.
Rachel, Yeah fun? Great! So uh  so did you guys hit it off?
Ross, I guess so.
Rachel, So uh  so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Ross, No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh  show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Rachel, Oh  slides.  So really nothing happened.
Ross, Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Rachel," Right. Was it the  ""Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"""
Ross, Anyway  if she  if she wasn’t in to me  why-why would she ask me out again?
Rachel, She asked-asked you out again?
Ross, Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night  Valentine’s Day  the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides  if you know what I mean.
Rachel, Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird  all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.
Ross,  Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay.  It’s okay. Hey  it’s too weird for you  I won’t see her again.
Rachel, Thank you. I…yeah.
Ross, I mean after tomorrow night.
Rachel, No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross  I can’t! I can’t do it!  It’s just gonna freak me out!!!
Ross, Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
Rachel, Ross thanks.
Ross, You want me to call her right now?
Rachel, Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No  I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?
Ross, Well umm  oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Rachel, Yeah do it now  call right now.
Monica,  This is my favorite part.
Phoebe,  Yeah me too.
Phoebe, Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler,  Well see now that I can see crying over  but Bambi is a cartoon!
Joey,  You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?
Chandler, Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Monica, Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.
Chandler, I’m not macho.
Monica, Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.
Chandler, No  I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
Joey, Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh  uh oh  what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Chandler, I’d be sad sure  but I wouldn’t cry.
Joey," Okay  what if the puppy said  ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."""
Chandler, Cry?! I just found a talking puppy  I’m rich!
Monica, Oh  I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Phoebe, All right  what’s going on there? 
Chandler, Oh  that’s Parent’s Day  first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
Monica, Where were your parents?
Chandler, Oh they didn’t want to come!
Phoebe, Oh Chandler!
Monica, Poor thing!
Phoebe, So that story doesn’t make you cry?
Chandler, No! Look  I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
Joey, No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!  Sure! Yeah! 
Phoebe, You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan.   Joey listen  take good care of that guy  okay?  He’s a fan.  Bye! 
Joey,  So  you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to  want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
Joey, Oh  you’re Phoebe’s fan!
Joey, Movies?
Joey,  I don’t think so.
Joey, Hey Gunther  don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!
Rachel, Hey!
Rachel, Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Rachel, It’s not random  it’s Bob.
Rachel, No honey  okay  okay  you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Rachel, Hm-mmm.
Rachel, Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
Rachel, No.
Rachel,  Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
Rachel, Look  this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there  you just…
Rachel, I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Rachel, Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
Rachel, All right  all right  well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Rachel, In Human Resources!!!!!!
Rachel, …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Monica, You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
Rachel, Do I have my own castle?
Ross, Hey! Uh  Phoebe’s not here is she?
Rachel, No.
Monica,  Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Joey, Uhhh  yeah. Yeah. But uh  I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.
Chandler, You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Joey, Sort of…
Monica, Guys  what’s going on?
Joey,  Phoebe’s a porn star!
Chandler, Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Monica, That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Joey, Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Ross, And-and I  and I saw that Joey was about to go in  so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and  and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. 
Rachel, Wow! I mean  I just—I can’t  I can’t believe this. Y’know  I mean you think you know someone even  even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.
Monica, This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though  y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler, Hey  I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
Monica, Yes  but you are dead inside.
Joey, All right well  I’d better take that back.
Monica, Wh-what  why?
Joey, We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!
Monica, Yeah you’re right  we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.
Rachel, Absolutely not.
Monica,  Y’know maybe a little bit!
Rachel, Probably just the first half.
Joey, No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well  I’m not gonna watch it!
Ross, Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Chandler, Her ankle is what you’re watching?
Rachel, Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God  if she would just stop moving.
Chandler, She’s just doing her job!
Joey,  You sick bastards!
Rachel, Oh  it’s a tattoo! That’s weird  Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Joey, Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Phoebe,  Hey! What’s up?  Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Monica, Hey sweetie!
Chandler, Hey! 
Monica,  Chicken Soup for the Soul?
Chandler, There’s no back to this couch!
Monica, Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chandler, Yeah I know  but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know  all dead inside.
Monica, Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry  I love you.
Chandler, Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica, Stop it!
Chandler, No  I mean  come on  seriously think about it  we get married  we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. 
Monica, I won’t care  because I know you will be feeling it all in here. 
Chandler, Yeah?
Monica, Yeah! And if  and if we have a baby one-day  and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry  so what! And-and-and  and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time  and you got nothing  it won’t matter to me.
Chandler, Okay  well I won’t uh  worry about this anymore then.
Monica," And-and-and if I die  from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says  ""I will always be with you "" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear  I know you’ll be crying a river inside."
Chandler, Aww  I love you so…
Monica, What is wrong with you?!!!
Chandler, What?!
Monica, What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now  I left you a note from the beyond!
Chandler, So you didn’t mean any of that?!
Monica, No you robot!!
Ross, You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time  I swear to…  Ohh  uh Jill. Umm  that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm  they’ve really taken a liking to me.  Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
Ross, Of course  what happened? 
Ross, Okay  umm…
Ross, What?
Ross, Wow! Really?!
Ross, Well  I’d love to! Here  you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
Ross, Ohh!
Rachel, Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
Monica, No  I haven’t.
Rachel, Well  is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her.
Phoebe, It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
Phoebe,  Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
Phoebe, You’re making one right now!
Phoebe, And-and you’re using my name!
Phoebe, Look  I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
Phoebe, What?!
Phoebe, No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you!  And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you  with that! 
Ross, Slides are almost ready.
Ross, Uh okay  well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
Ross,  Hello?
Rachel,  What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Ross, O-okay  Rach calm-calm down  okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
Rachel, Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ross, So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Rachel, Ross  I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ross, Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself  I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh  that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, So  I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Joey, Oh no  not you too!
Phoebe, No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
Joey, Nice!
Phoebe, Um-mmm  and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Joey, That’s great  but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?
Phoebe, Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Joey, You do?
Phoebe, Yeah.   You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right  I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay?  Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!  See?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross,  You uh  you may have been right about Jill.
Rachel, Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Ross, Umm  she kissed me.
Rachel, What?! You kissed!
Chandler,  Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica,  Shhhh!!!
Ross, Look  I uh  I tried not to kiss her  okay?
Rachel, Well  it doesn’t sound like it! I mean  it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone  you just don’t kiss them! See look at us  right now  not kissing!
Ross, Let me finish  okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
Rachel, Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! 
Ross, Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Rachel, Oh  well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
Ross, Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, No  I mean  look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us  again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Rachel, Wow. I  I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. 
Ross, You’re welcome. 
Monica, Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Chandler,  I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
Rachel, Yeah  I got that.
Ross, You take care Jill.
Rachel, Bye-bye-e!
Monica, Bye.
Chandler,  I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it  I opened a gate.
Rachel, Hey  you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Wow!
Joey,  What is the matter with you?!
Phoebe, No! Barry and Mindy.
Joey, Oh sorry  I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?
Rachel, Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
Joey, Ohh-oh  wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
Rachel, Yeah  but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Monica, Why did they get divorced?
Rachel, Well  apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God  could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
Ross, I know what you mean  I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
Phoebe, Which time?
Ross, The first time! No seriously  imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
Joey,  I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.
Ross, I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know  not doing anything else physical.
Chandler, Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Monica, And what if I was still fat?  Well  you wouldn’t be dating me  that’s for sure.
Chandler, Sure I would!
Chandler, What  you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
Ross, No  I just think Monica was that fat.
Joey, Hey  imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey  there’s Carol again!
Chandler, What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker  getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow  I-I don’t have to wear a tie.
Phoebe, What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Merrill Lynch?
Phoebe, Yeah  I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Rachel, Well why didn’t you take the job?
Phoebe, Because at that time you see  I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks  I’d have to live in a box  and only eat lox  and have a pet fox.
Ross, Hey  do you guys think that if all those things happened  we’d still hang out?
Ross,  Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rachel,  Rob Tillman!
Ross, No-no. It’s-it’s me  Ross!
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
Ross, No  no-no  Ross Geller.
Rachel, Ohh  of course Monica’s brother!
Ross, Yeah. Right.
Rachel, Wow! How are you?!
Ross, Good-good  I’m-I’m married. 
Rachel, Ohh! Me too!
Ross, Is-isn’t it the best?
Rachel, Oh  it’s the best!  So  umm how’s Monica?
Ross, Oh really  really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street  umm  do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
Rachel, Ohh  I would love too.
Ross, Yeah? Oh-oh  she’d be so excited!
Rachel, Ohh! Okay!
Ross, Come on! 
Rachel, Oh wait  don’t you have to pay for your   Busty Ladies?
Ross, No  it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him  but I don’t…
Rachel,  Oh yeah? Okay.
Ross,  Okay.
Rachel, But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
Ross, Uh-huh.  Hey  here you go buddy. Sorry  no porn for you.  Okay  let’s go see Monica!
Joey, So Monica  still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Monica, He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.
Monica, Thanks.
Joey,  Wow!!
Joey, Oh dear God  let me think. 
Chandler,  Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Oh no! What’s the matter?
Chandler," Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny  just not ""Archie Comic funny."""
Monica, Okay.
Monica, Bye.
Chandler, Was his question what’s more boring than him?
Joey, Hey man  look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh  do you need me to give you some money?
Chandler, Hey  I may have no money  but I still have my pride.
Joey, Really?
Chandler, Ehh.
Monica, Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money  TV stars have assistants right?
Joey, That’s an idea!  Hey  if I hired an assistant  would-would you take money from her?
Monica, No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See  he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
Joey, That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!
Chandler, I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Joey, Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Chandler, Okay!
Joey, All right! Now hey  I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there  take a break!
Chandler, All right!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Phoebe, Ohh that’s so sweet!  Oh! Hang on!  Hang onnnnnn!!!   Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0  it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No  it’s okay. It’s okay  you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding  you are of course fired.
Ross, Hey Mon!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Mon  look who I ran into! 
Monica,  Oh my God! Rachel!!   You look terrific!
Rachel, Ohh  so do you! Did you lose weight? 
Monica, You are so sweet to notice! Yes  I lost three and a half pounds!
Ross, And  and uh  you-you remember my friend Chandler. 
Chandler, Hey.
Rachel, Oh yeah.
Ross, And that’s Phoebe over there! 
Phoebe, Hi!
Monica, Oh my God  sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?
Ross,  1987  the day after Christmas  at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs  y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.
Rachel, Oh yeah. Right. So now  are—do you  do you still do music?
Ross, Sometimes  you should come over  sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…
Rachel,  Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives  just walked in here!
Monica, Rach  he’s a friend of ours.
Rachel,  You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Chandler, Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.
Ross,  Hey-hey  or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
Rachel, He’s coming over! He’s coming over!
Monica,  Joey!
Joey,  I know  here-here!! 
Monica, Ohhh!  No! This is my friend Rachel  we went to High School together.
Rachel,  Hi!
Joey,  Hi!
Rachel,  Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean  when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
Joey, Well  it’s always nice to meet the fans.
Rachel, Ah!
Joey,  She’s not crazy is she?
Monica, No.
Joey,  So uh  how you doin’?
Phoebe, Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!  Go!! Who’s this?  Oh okay  you’re gonna like working for me. What’s your name?  What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right  from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.
Joey,  Hey there you are!
Chandler, Uh-oh  it’s my boss!
Joey, All right  here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man  this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right  I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today  but only one of them is mine! 
Chandler,  Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Monica,  You realize what you are don’t you?
Chandler, What?
Monica, You’re his bitch.
Phoebe,  No-no!! No!!
Monica,  Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
Phoebe, No! There-there was a little  a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
Chandler, But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Phoebe, What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great  now my chest hearts.
Monica, What?!
Phoebe,  My chest hurts! Oh  and now I-I can’t breathe.
Chandler, Phoebe  are you having a heart attack?!
Phoebe, Oh  if I were  would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Monica, Yes!!
Phoebe, Then yes that is what I’m having. 
Monica, Oh my God!
Ross, Come on Pheebs  it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.
Phoebe, Most people don’t like their jobs  I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Monica, Honey  having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.
Chandler, I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die!  But you’re not gonna die. I mean  you are going to die  but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Monica, Let’s take a walk.  Y’know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! 
Phoebe,  So what’s going on with you?
Ross, Well umm  I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
Phoebe, Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe, How long has it been since you had sex?
Ross, Well  last weekend…
Phoebe, Oh that’s not so bad.
Ross, …will be two months…
Phoebe, That is.
Ross, …since I stopped trying.
Phoebe, Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Ross, What-what do you mean?
Phoebe, I don’t know. You could tie her up  she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
Ross, Oh.
Phoebe, Y’know  dirty talk  m�nage � trois  toys…
Ross, Wow!
Phoebe, Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Ross, Okay  I think I got it.
Phoebe, Yeah! Or too  you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching!  It never happened.
Monica, Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?
Chandler," Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is  ""Bring me food."" Two is  ""I’m with a girl  bring us food."" Three is  ""I’m lost and I can’t find food."""
Joey,  Hey! Is uh  is she gonna be all right?
Monica, Yeah! She’s right in there! 
Joey, Oh great.   Hey! Go take off those pants  they look ready!
Joey, All right  and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.
Rachel, Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Joey, Well  that is a large piece of television equipment.  And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, All righty  what do you say we head back to my place?
Rachel,  Wow! Umm  y’know  I-I would really love to  but I-I shouldn’t.
Joey, Why?  Why can’t the world stop turning  just for a moment? Just for us?
Rachel,  Isn’t that a line from the show?!
Joey, Uh  yeah but uh   I may have said those things before but  I never truly meant them. Until now.
Rachel, That’s a line from the show too!
Joey, Okay  you watch too much TV.
Chandler,  Here you go Joe  here’s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. 
Joey, Thanks!  Yeah  there’s pulp in that. 
Chandler, Yeah?
Joey, I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice  okay?
Chandler, I’m sorry  I guess I just like the pulp.
Joey, Oh my God  I’m sorry  I’m being so rude.  Rachel  would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
Rachel, Yeah sure  iced tea would be great.
Joey,  Iced tea.
Chandler, Okay  anything for you sir?
Joey,  Did I not just tell him?
Rachel,  Yes  you did.
Joey,  Okay look  Chandler  if this  you have got to listen!   You’re gonna throw that juice at me  aren’t ya?
Chandler, It’s not all juice! 
Ross, So honey  this morning was fun  huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Ross, Look Carol umm  I was  I was thinking maybe uh  maybe we can spice things up a little.
Ross, Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…
Ross, Hey there little fella! Hey  uh-hey  why don’t we get some shoes on ya  huh? Hey  why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on  in your room! Yay!!
Ross, Yay!  Seriously  our sex life… I was thinking  maybe I don’t know  we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?
Ross, Well I don’t know umm   what if we were too tie each other up?  Umm  some people eat stuff off one another.  Nah! Umm  y’know we-we could try dirty talk?  Umm  we could  we could have a threesome.
Chandler, Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Monica, Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow!  You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Chandler, Aww.
Monica, Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar!
Chandler, You wanna share it?
Monica, Okay!!
Joey,  Hey! Hey Chandler look  I know you’re mad  but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh  I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean  y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
Monica, It’s not mayonnaise!!
Joey, Yeah  o-o-o-o-okay anyway  I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here. 
Chandler, What’s this?
Joey, Fresh squeezed orange juice  with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Chandler, Aww  thanks man. 
Monica, Hey Joey  Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Joey, Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!
Chandler, Oh you wouldn’t uh  care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.
Joey, Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Chandler, Well uh  Archie needs money to fix his jalopy   uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.
Joey, Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!
Rachel, Oh Mon  listen I have to ask! Okay  Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment  now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Monica, Yeah  a lot. A lot  a lot!
Rachel, Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh  I just cannot believe this! I mean  Joey Tribbiani!
Monica, Well  y’know it’s none of my business  but aren’t you married?
Rachel, Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!
Monica, Well  you’re not.
Rachel, Oh  it’s so easy for you I mean  you’re not married  you get to have sex with who ever you want!
Monica, Yeah I can!  And don’t think I don’t  because I do! I mean all the time  you betcha! 
Rachel, Monica. You’ve  you’ve done it right?
Monica,  Of course I have! What do you think  I’m some 30 year old virgin?
Rachel, Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!
Monica, Say it louder  I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Monica, It’s not like  I haven’t any opportunities. I mean  y’know  I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger  all right? He’s not perfect  but umm  I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know  give him my flower.
Rachel, Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey  you’ve waited long enough!!
Monica, Y’know what? You are right?!
Rachel, Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know  people should be able to sleep with who ever they want  whenever…
Monica, Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Rachel, Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Monica, Phoebe  why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Phoebe, Oh yeah  the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Monica, Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Phoebe, No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Monica, Put it out!!
Phoebe, Okay! Okay!  I’m so glad you’re here.
Ross, Come on.  I got it.
Phoebe, Oh  give it to me.
Ross, I got it!
Phoebe, Give it!
Ross,  Hello?  No she can’t come to the phone right now.  Oh  right no problem. Okay  bye-bye. 
Phoebe, Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Ross, J-j-just relax  nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Phoebe, Thank God.
Ross,  Yeah  she’s fired.
Rachel,  Oh! Thank God!
Rachel, Okay!  Here we go! Okay!  Hi  Joey! It’s Rachel! Umm  I am free tomorrow night. Yeah  sure  sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Ross, So honey this uh  this threesome thing umm  I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…
Ross, Oh.  Wow!  Huh.  Boy!  Well  someone’s been doing their homework. 
Ross, Oh  I know.  Y’know  just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…
Ross, Yeah? Well  I-I think Ben’s asleep.
Ross, Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. 
Ross, Hey  Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey.
Ross, Hey  how’s it going?
Phoebe, Well  I’ve got to get out of this bed  I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
Monica,  Here you go sweetie.
Phoebe, What the hell is this  herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Monica, But  I put some honey in it.
Ross, She doesn’t know she was fired yet  does she?
Chandler, No  the doctors say it may kill her.
Phoebe, What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Chandler,  But I think we should tell her.
Ross, Hey Pheebs  maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign  that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
Phoebe, Okay  what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! 
Chandler, Listen Phoebe  he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Phoebe, I know! But if I didn’t work there  what else would I do?
Monica, Well  you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe, Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Chandler, Uh  what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Phoebe, Hmm  pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh  what do I do?! What will I do?!
Rachel, Ohh  I mean it’s just so realistic!
Joey, I know.  Yeah  his name is Pat.
Rachel, Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! 
Joey,  Do you uh  do you—ready for a refill?
Rachel, Oh  I probably shouldn’t—so I will!  Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!
Joey, Pretty cool  huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism  well you’d be wrong.
Rachel, Umm  can I use your bathroom?
Joey, It’s uh  right through there. 
Rachel, Okay.  God y’know  if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…
Joey, Yeah  life’s pretty great isn’t it?
Rachel, Yeah  it sure is!
Monica, I hope you’re hungry  we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters  don’t you?
Monica, No! Umm well  some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
Monica, People! People say it! Come here! 
Monica, And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat  with our hands.
Monica, No-no-no  no! It’s sensual!
Monica, Okay!  Ohhh no!
Monica, I can’t promise anything. 
Ross, We’re really gonna do this  huh?
Ross, Y’know  if  if this is too weird for you  we can still back out at… 
Ross, Okay.
Ross, I’m-I’m Ross by the way.
Ross, How hot is this?!
Chandler, I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.
Monica, Yeah  me too.
Chandler," Well  I could make it seem like he’s here.  ""Here’s some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn’t add the second cous until 1979."" "
Monica, Stop it!! That’s not funny!!
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, I’m sorry  okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know  it was supposed to be a big deal.
Chandler, What was tonight?
Monica, You don’t want to know what tonight was.
Chandler, Okay.  What was tonight?
Monica, Well  tonight was—was going to be my first time.
Chandler, With Roger?  Not just with Roger?!  Oh my God!
Monica, All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!
Chandler, Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!
Monica, How many?
Chandler, Nine.
Monica, I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Chandler, Well good  good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
Monica, No. He’s not a horrible guy.
Chandler, Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.
Monica, Chandler  I’m gonna die a virgin!
Chandler, No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Monica, Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, I was kidding.
Chandler, So was I.
Rachel, Joey  you’re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Joey, Well  with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey  I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Rachel, Wow! Tell me something Joey——Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
Joey, Yeah you did.
Rachel, Okay. 
Joey, Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey, When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Rachel, Wow! I can’t  I can’t feel my hands.
Joey, Come  come here.
Chandler, We can’t do this.
Monica, No!  Oyster?
Chandler, Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me  y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.
Monica, Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible  how would I know?
Chandler, I do like that.
Monica, It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Chandler, Well  if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight  right?
Monica, Absolutely! It would just be one friend  helping out another friend. 
Chandler, Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!
Monica, Noo!! Okay!!
Chandler, Okay! 
Monica, Umm  do you have any uhh  moves?
Chandler, I have some moves.
Monica, I have no moves.  Okay  whatcha doin’ there?!  Oh y’know what? I’m sorry  this is just too weird.
Chandler, Yeah  let’s just forget it.
Monica, What if I turn out the lights? 
Chandler, Okay!
Chandler, Oh yeah.
Monica, Chandler?
Chandler,  Yeah?
Monica, That’s the couch.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Monica, I know! I’ll tell you something  we are gonna do that again!
Chandler, Oh  okay! 
Joey,  Morning!
Rachel,  Oh right.
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel,  Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Joey, Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Rachel, Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t  we didn’t uhh…
Joey, No! No! No  not after seeing that.
Rachel, God I’m just a horrible person.
Joey, Wh-why?
Rachel, Because I’m married. That’s right  I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
Joey," That’s ridiculous! I’m not a ""Star "" just a regular famous actor."
Rachel, Yeah and I’m a horrible  horrible person.
Joey, Rachel  would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look  remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…
Rachel, The ring from the cave  yeah.
Joey, Wow! Uh okay  well uh… 
Rachel,  Oh my God  they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey, Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
Rachel, No! No-no-no…
Joey, Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it  I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay  you’ve had the chance to cheat  and with me  but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.
Rachel, But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
Joey, Look  do you want the ring or not?!
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Look at you! You’re up!
Joey, All right!
Phoebe, I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work  are ya?
Phoebe, No. I’ve learned my lesson.
Phoebe, Let’s go! Come on! Move it!  Come on!  Shoes! Briefcase!  Thanks Lou  good luck with the gall bladder. 
Ross, Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?
Joey,  Well uh  look Ross I uh  I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man  but I….
Ross, No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.
Joey, You?
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, Wow!
Ross, Yeah!
Joey, All right! So  was it amazing?
Ross, It was  it was okay.
Joey, Just okay—Did you do it right?!
Ross," Look  it’s just did  did you ever go to a party and think  ""Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"""
Joey, Huh. But still Ross  you’re worst day with two women  pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
Ross, Oh-oh  absolutely!
Ross, It’s just  my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then  and then there was a lot of waiting around.
Joey, But you got to be with both of them  right?
Ross, Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Joey, Not the other one?
Ross, No  she kept kicking me away!
Joey, Yeah  you don’t want that.
Ross, No!
Joey, Well hey  at least you got to see a lot of stuff  right?
Ross, Oh I a lot of stuff!
Joey, You got a little bored?
Ross, A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
Joey, Yeah? What did ya have?
Ross, Just a sandwich. Turkey  a little mustard…
Joey, Sounds good.
Ross, It really was!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
Monica, Hey  check me out  I’m a slut!
Chandler, So you uh  want to do something tonight?
Monica, Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Chandler, Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh  he’s a good guy. I mean  I remember a time when… 
Monica, Are you okay?
Chandler, Yeah! Totally! Totally  and you?
Monica," Great! It’s so amazing! I mean  last time Dr. Roger came over  I was so nervous  but then after being with you I’m all like  ""Can the doctor see me now?"""
Chandler, I bet he can.
Monica, Y’know  I don’t have an appointment  but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?
Chandler, Oh yeah! Yeah! Don’t worry about me  I’ll be fine! 
Rachel, Ohh! My God! Barry!!
Rachel, Oh that’s right! I’m sorry! I-I am early! Finish! Please!!
Phoebe, Surprise! Look who’s back!

Phoebe, Nu-uh!
Phoebe, Oh  okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway  I’ll be in my office.
Phoebe, That’s all right  I’ll work here. This is goo  next to this plant. 
Phoebe, You’re in my office! Look  I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…
Phoebe, Oh  so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh  you have got to be kidding!
Phoebe, I’m having another heart attack!

Ross, Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker  look can I just say not all men are like that.
Rachel, Oh. 
Ross, Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Rachel, Who are these men?
Ross, Men. I guy I know.
Rachel, Well  you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.
Ross, She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
Rachel, Good day for married people huh?
Ross, I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
Rachel, I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.
Ross, Try telling my wife that.
Chandler,  Okay to come in?
Monica, Yeah  come on  eat  whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Chandler, Yeah I know  guess who beeped him?
Monica, What?!
Chandler, I’m the ruptured spleen. 
Monica, Why would you do that?
Chandler, Because you shouldn’t be with him.  You should be with me.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yeah! When you were talking about Roger  that was killing me! Look  things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women  in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends  but with you I always y’know with a friend.
Monica, Chandler!
Chandler," I know you probably don’t want to go out with me  y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a ""doctor…"""
Monica, There was just one woman  wasn’t there?
Chandler, No  there were two.
Monica, Including me?
Chandler, Oh yeah.
Phoebe, 
Ross, Hey  remember when I had a monkey?
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross, Yeah  what  what was I thinking?
Joey,  Hey! So  what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Chandler, Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Joey, Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!
Chandler, I see where you’re goin’!
Ross, What’s up with the greed Joe?
Joey, All right  look I’m sorry you guys  but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive  y’know? I’m down to like three! Well  actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?! 
Ross, Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean  can’t-can’t you pick up  I don’t know  an extra shift here?
Phoebe, Or  y’know  I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this  goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
Ross, Oh  wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
Joey, Oh  ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute  I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Chandler,  Ah  finally an explanation.
Joey, No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff  remember? Let’s see uh  well I don’t want to donate sperm again.  I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know?  Ooh-ooh  maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something  huh?
Joey, Yeah?
Joey, Uhh do it?
Joey, Well  where was I? 
Ross, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey  what have you guys been up to?
Phoebe, Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Ross, Wow!
Rachel, Yeah  kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Joey, Takes it out of you? 
Phoebe, Now  we can kick anybody’s ass!
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, After one class? I don’t think so.
Rachel, What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Ross, Well  of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming  that’s not enough. Look  I studying kara-tay for a long time  and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.
Rachel, Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
Ross, No  it’s a concept!
Phoebe, Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
Ross, All right  maybe it means that too…
Rachel, Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Ross, Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!
Phoebe,  Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Ross, Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Phoebe, You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Ross,  All I’m saying is  it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack  I don’t know  like a  surprise!!
Ross, All right  you know that one was coming  but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. 
Rachel,  Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations  we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Ross, Y’know what… 
Chandler, Hey-hey  is Monica here?
Phoebe, No.
Ross, No.
Chandler, Okay  look I need your help  I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
Rachel, Well  Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago  so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!
Chandler,  She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
Joey, Ohh  hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Phoebe, Ooh  Joey  that’s actually a really good idea!
Joey, And of course  crotchless panties.
Chandler, Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother   I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
Rachel, Aw  I love that.
Phoebe, You guys!
Joey, You can’t make crotchless panties? You take  you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…
Rachel,  Okay-okay-okay! So  making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Chandler, Yeah  I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Phoebe, Oh  I love paper mache! What did you make?
Chandler, I made a… 
Phoebe, What is that?
Chandler, Nothing!
Ross, So what are you gonna do?
Chandler, Well  have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Phoebe, Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies!  Oh for crying out loud!
Rachel, Hey  wait a minute! That is my sock!
Phoebe, Now  it’s you little bunny friend. 
Chandler,  This  this actually is a… 
Monica,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey! Honey  can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?
Monica, Oh  yeah.
Chandler, Do we have to make the entire thing?
Monica, Yes! Why  did you—you forget to make yours?
Chandler, Of course  of course not. I just have to uh  go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Monica, Okay.  Okay  I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever!  I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Chandler,  What?
Monica, I’m just so excited to make the presents!  Shoot!
Joey,  Hi uh  I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.
Joey, Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh  are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?
Joey, Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. 
Joey, But it’s $2 000.
Joey, Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Ross, DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Phoebe, Ross!!!
Rachel, What the hell was that?!
Ross, A lesson in the importance of unagi. 
Phoebe, Ohh  you’re a freak!!
Ross, Perhaps. Now I’m curious  at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Rachel, All right  so we weren’t prepared!
Ross, I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point  but I—look  I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ahhh  huh? Unagi.
Joey,  2 000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh  I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? 
Chandler, Hey.
Ross,  Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Chandler, What?!
Ross, Unagi. I’m always aware.
Chandler, Okay  are you aware unagi  is an eel?
Ross, What’s up?
Chandler, I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
Ross, Oh  why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
Chandler, I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Ross, Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this.  Uh  it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Chandler, Yeah  I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Ross, Yeah-yeah  except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm  your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. 
Chandler, Wait a minute  I can’t give this to her.
Ross, Why not?
Chandler," Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
Ross, Oh.
Rachel, Ahhhhh  salmon skin roll. 
Chandler, Okay. Okay.  Yes honey  I made it myself.  I can’t do it. I can’t do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! 
Chandler, Hey! Hi! You uh  ready to exchange gifts?
Monica, Sure! Okay  you go first.
Chandler, Okay  come here! Come here.
Monica, Okay! 
Chandler, Now  it’s not wrapped because I just  just finished it.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica, Oh  what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Chandler,  Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
Monica, Oh  I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler, Okay!
Monica, Okay  you ready to open yours?
Chandler, Yeah!
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, It’s a sock bunny.
Monica, Yeah-yeah  you remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler, Not really.
Monica, Well  I did one time  and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.
Chandler, I see. Y’know umm  Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Monica, No! No  she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe  what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!
Chandler, Oh  it’s okay. I don’t…
Monica, No-no  it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I  I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here   and I am going to do anything you want in there! 
Chandler,  Well  I did put a lot of thought in the tape. 
Chandler, Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!
Monica, Oops!  Y’know  your birthday is in a month-and-a-half  what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Chandler, You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Monica, We have got to wash that! 
Chandler, Yeah! 
Monica, Do you remember that jacket that you love so much  that you thought was too expensive?
Chandler, You have done enough!
Monica, I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Chandler, No you don’t—get it in black  not brown.
Monica, Oop  your cake is ready!
Chandler, Oop!
Chandler, Well  it’s like that old saying  have some sex  eat some cake.
Monica, Who the hell are you?!
Joey,  No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! 
Joey, Look  I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Chandler, Who the hell is Carl?!
Joey, Oh  did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Chandler, Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you  aren’t they?
Joey, Okay  I know it sounds crazy  but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is  Carl’s acting is… 
Monica, The only problem!
Joey, Yeah  he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers  but he messed it up.
Joey,  Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! 
Phoebe, Pat Sajak?
Rachel, Yep!
Phoebe, Alex Trebek?
Rachel, Oh  of course!
Phoebe, Chuck Woolery?
Rachel, Definitely! Phoebe  you will not find a single game show host  who’s ass I cannot kick.
Rachel, Say it!
Phoebe, Say we are unagi!
Ross, It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Rachel, Say it!
Ross, Y’know what? I can easily get out of this  but there is a chance you can get very  very hurt!
Joey, All right Carl  we’re next. Now remember  what is not gonna be?
Joey, That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
Joey,  Damnit Carl! 
Joey, That’s us.
Joey, That’s right  $2 000.
Joey, Damnit Carl!
Chandler, Oh my good God.
Monica, Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight  No. 3  macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Chandler, Look  you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.
Monica, I will! But not tonight. For dinner music  I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Chandler, Oh  the mixed tape.
Monica, The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Monica, You are just the sweetest. 
Chandler, No! You’re the sweetest! 
Ross, It’s a great class.
Ross, Yeah  yeah  I was watching.  Umm  hey  a couple of questions though. Umm  about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor  what-what-what-what would you do next?
Ross, No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Ross, Yes that’s right.
Ross, I tired attacking two women  did not work.
Ross, No  I mean it’s okay  I mean  they’re-they’re my friends. In fact  I-I-I was married to one of them.
Ross, Oh  no! No-no! No  I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that’s a no.
Chandler, I am so  so  so  so sorry!
Monica,  Uh-huh.
Chandler, And I will cook anything you want in here   and do anything in there! 
Monica,  Yeah you will!  And  are you kiddin’ me?!
Chandler, Come on Monica  it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please  please?
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Okay. 
Chandler, So  are we going in there?
Monica, I am!! 
Ross, Ah-ha  nowhere to run! 
Rachel, I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over… 
Phoebe,  No Rachel! They got here first!
Phoebe, Why is Ross doing that?
Ross, DANGER!!!!
Rachel, Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!
Phoebe, We should help him!
Rachel, I… Well  I don’t think they need any help.
Ross," Hey! I just got uh  my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote  ""I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller  you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"""
Chandler, Ahh  Hotties of the Paleontology Department  there’s a big selling calendar  eh?
Rachel, Who wrote it?
Ross, Oh  I wish I knew  but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Joey, Oh hey  do you still have their final exams?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, Oh  ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom  there’s your admirer. 
Chandler, A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
Rachel, Okay  wait a minute  wait a minute  why are we so sure that this is a girl?
Ross, It’s a girl! Anyway  it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.
Chandler, Oh  is that against the rules?
Ross, No  but it is frowned upon.
Chandler, I see.
Ross, Besides  there’s a big age difference.
Joey, Oh  well think of it like this  when you’re 90…
Ross, I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.
Joey, No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No  what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Joey, Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
Chandler, Oh yeah  Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Phoebe, What’s a Movement class?
Monica, It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
Joey, Oh well listen  anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
Chandler, Oh  I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
Joey, No-no-no  please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
Chandler, You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand  four hundred…
Joey, Hey-hey dude  why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
Chandler, Oh okay  I’ll-I’ll try.
Joey, All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen  the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Chandler, Yeah so  Tuesday?
Joey,  Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this  the third day. All right? Monday  one day. Tuesday  two day. Wednesday  when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
Chandler,  Thank you.
Joey, Okay.
Rachel,  Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
Chandler, You just thought of that in there?
Monica, Yeah sure  nature called  she wanted to see who else did.
Rachel,  Hello?  Uh  Rachel.  Great  someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Monica, You’re on the phone!
Rachel,  Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you!  That was the fire department  there was a fire at our place!
Phoebe, Oh my God! How bad was it?
Rachel, Well  he didn’t say  but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on  we gotta go!
Monica, Come on! 
Chandler, What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
Joey, The part I want to audition for is a fireman  this is so meant to be!
Ross,  Yeah?
Ross, Oh thank you. Thanks very much.  Ow! 
Ross, That was you?
Ross, Oh I  I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
Ross, What time?
Ross, Gotcha. 
Ross, Oh! So-so seriously  what time?
Phoebe, Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!
Monica, Oh well  it’s not so bad.
Phoebe, Oh!
Rachel, My God! 
Joey,  Hey buddy  do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Monica, Joey! He’s working!  You would look good in that.
Joey, Oh  how bad is it?
Phoebe, Oh  it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
Chandler, How’s your room Rach?
Rachel, Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater. 
Monica, Isn’t that mine?
Rachel, Fine! I’m sorry for your loss! 
Rachel,  Wow! Oh-okay  look pal  I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Monica,  Yes  they can stay with us.
Chandler, Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Phoebe, No  not usually. But yeah  I could use one right now.
Phoebe, Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
Rachel, Okay Phoebe calm down  there’s no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles.
Chandler, God  it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!
Joey, Chandler  is that… 
Chandler,  Oh that’s great! Good for you.
Joey, Hey-hey listen… 
Chandler, Okay! So yeah  maybe we can get together umm…  Can you hold for one second please?  What?!
Joey, When you’re off the phone  do you wanna get a pizza?
Chandler,  Hi! I’m back.  Yeah  that sounds great.  Okay. Well  we’ll do it then.  Okay  bye-bye. 
Joey, Hey listen  so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday  but what time?
Chandler, Hi.
Monica, Hey!
Chandler,  We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.
Joey, Ah-ha!
Monica, Wow! So  now you’re going on a date with this girl?
Chandler, Honey  it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules  y’know? You gotta  you got to put in some time.
Monica, You’re right  I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know  going out with an ex-girlfriend.
Chandler, No  we only went out once.
Monica, You dated her!
Chandler, Not once!
Monica, All right  well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Joey, Hey  you wanna do Joey a favor  maybe you go out with Joey. 
Chandler,  Oh that’s great  my friend Joey’s in the movie business.
Chandler,  My friend’s name is Joey.
Chandler, Yeah  I’ve always hated that Howie.
Chandler, The nerve huh?
Chandler, Refill?
Monica, Now  this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
Rachel, Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
Monica, I know! Now look  there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one  so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.
Phoebe, Well  since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
Rachel, Hey! Hey-hey  now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
Phoebe, Well no  it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
Rachel, Okay! 
Monica, So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm  you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you  y’know  in bed. Oh  you have been through so much.
Rachel, I have.
Joey, This right here is where I keep the pizza.  And uh that’s where the napkin is. 
Phoebe, What’s that smell?
Joey, I know! 
Ross, What? Of course I did! You uh  you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Ross, Oh uh  I had trouble remembering everyone’s name  so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Ross, Umm  no. No.
Ross, Umm  it’s Cutie McPretty.
Ross, Listen  I gotta tell ya  I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird  the whole student teacher thing  and to be frank I thought it would be too  but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
Ross,  Burt!
Phoebe, So did you sleep well last night?
Rachel, I did.
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, I did  Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Phoebe, Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Gum!
Phoebe, Yeah I know  it was my candle. My candle!
Phoebe, I don’t use a curling iron.
Rachel, Well  don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
Rachel, Oh.
Joey, This is where I keep the pizza.  And—Hey! Where did the napkin go?! 
Monica, Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Phoebe, Thanks Monica!
Monica, Does that smell bother you?
Phoebe, What the smell from Joey’s? No  I can hardly smell it over here.
Monica, Well you let me know if you can  because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.
Phoebe, I can smell it a little  bake the pie.
Monica, Okay!
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Hello?  Oh yes  one minute please.  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.
Phoebe, Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
Joey,  Yeah  so it turns out that it wasn’t the hair straightener that started the fire.  No-no  it was the candles. It’s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact  one of the first things they teach you in fire school is…  Uhh… Uhh… Okay. Well  I have to go now. 
Ross, We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem  but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.   A concept lost on some people!
Monica, So it’s okay to date a student.
Ross, Well  not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything  but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night  Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Monica, Well Ross  you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Ross, Yeah. What-what should I do?
Joey, Well Ross  it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel  huh? Ross  you gotta follow your heart.
Monica, Joey that is so sweet.
Chandler,  Hey.
Joey, Hey-hey-hey! So  how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Chandler, I couldn’t do it.
Joey, You couldn’t do it?!
Chandler, Hey  relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
Monica, What?! You’re going out with her again!
Ross, Going out with who?
Chandler, Uh  Dana Keystone from college.
Ross, Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh… 
Chandler, No  that was Dana Caplin.
Monica, Joey! You didn’t even know her!
Joey, Ah whatever!
Chandler, Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Chandler, Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  that’s not—No-no-no!
Chandler, No-no—Really?!
Chandler,  Well  it just hurts so bad. I uh…
Chandler, Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
Chandler, Well  I umm  I mean this is just off the top of my head now  umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm  but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
Chandler, Well  the heart wants what it wants. I’ll see you later. 
Monica, Hey! How’s it goin’?
Phoebe, Well  not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Monica, Yes it has! I made cookies!
Phoebe, Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
Monica, But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica,  Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed  remember? No crumbies!
Phoebe,  Okay  I’ll be out in a second.
Monica, Okay!
Monica,  What are you doing?
Phoebe, That doesn’t lock does it?
Rachel, Oh  Joey! Sorry!
Joey, No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Rachel, Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
Joey, Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Rachel, Really?
Joey, Yeah! Look! 
Rachel, I’ve never lived like this before.
Joey, I know.
Joey, All right  don’t waste it  I mean its still food. 
Ross, What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Ross, Oh  you have some studying to do?
Ross, Y’know I remember when uh  when I was in college  we used to… 
Ross, Nothing  I’m-I’m just  I’m so comfortable with you!
Ross, What? No! Of course  of course I do! Are-are they gone?
Ross, What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right  this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean  I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
Ross, That’s right Lydia  Elizabeth here is a student and uh  we’re dating. And you may frown upon that  but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.
Ross, What?
Ross, Really? Its not just frowned upon?
Rachel, I love it at Joey’s!
Joey, Hey  here you go. 
Chandler,  Ni-hi-ice!
Rachel, Thanks!
Chandler,  So  you busy Thursday?
Joey, Oh  very funny. I don’t know if you remember  but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.  You got me the audition?! Let’s hug it up! 
Chandler, Okay. Okay.  What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Phoebe,  Hey! Hi!
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe,  Listen umm  yeah okay  I need to talk to you!
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, Now I know that they said that the umm  the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see  I didn’t  I didn’t tell you but umm  but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it  that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
Rachel, No  no-no-no. Phoebe  this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.
Phoebe, Okay. Oh umm  Chandler  Monica is looking for you.
Chandler, Really?
Phoebe, Yeah she said something about crumbies.
Chandler, No! No! No! I was so careful! 
Phoebe,  Okay  you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
Joey, That’s right  all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.
Rachel, No! No! Phoebe  come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Phoebe, No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
Rachel, I know. I’m sorry.
Phoebe, All right fine! This looks like so much fun. 
Joey, Yeah.
Phoebe, God  what a mess. 
Ross, Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.
Ross, I know  I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.
Ross, What?
Ross, Really?
Ross, Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh  it’s wrong.
Ross,  No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.
Ross, Let’s also get a hot plate!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, So?!
Joey, So?
Chandler, It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
Joey, Wh? Monday  one day. Tuesday  two day. Wednesday  when huh what? Thurs— Oh! 
Joey, Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha!  Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!
Rachel, Hi Joey  how ya doin’?
Joey, Great! Roomie!
Rachel, Huh  yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Joey, Yeah! Well  now that you brought it up  our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now  I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
Rachel, I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Joey, Look Rach  my parents bought this fridge just after I was born  okay? Now  I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?
Rachel, That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
Joey, All right  now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time  I’ll take a check for the other hundred.
Rachel, You’re jokin’ right?
Joey, Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.
Rachel, Thank God you’re pretty. 
Rachel, Hey!
Rachel, Do you guys know any cute guys?
Chandler, Well  of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. 
Joey, Oh  I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.
Rachel, Anyway  there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table  so I kinda have to go…
Monica, What’s the charity?
Rachel, I don’t know  something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.
Monica, Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
Rachel, Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
Phoebe, Well  what kind of guy are you looking for?
Rachel, Well  someone that has his own tux  or has the ability to rent a tux.
Chandler, So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Joey, Ooh! So close.
Ross, Hey everybody!
Ross, Hey uh  this is Elizabeth.
Chandler,  Isn’t she cute?  No!
Phoebe, Y’know  this is probably none of my business  but weren’t you guys supposed to not be seen in public together?
Ross, Oh no-no-no  we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. 
Phoebe, Oh  sly.
Ross, Bye.
Ross, Oh that is quite all right ma’am. 
Chandler, So  why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Ross, Yes  her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Chandler, Oh  tell her good luck with that.
Ross, Anyone else? Huh? Bring ‘em on!
Rachel, Oo! When’s her birthday?!
Ross, I don’t know Rachel  why?
Rachel, Well  y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.
Monica, Oh  I like Elizabeth.
Ross, Well thanks!
Monica, Yeah. In fact  I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know  a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.
Joey, Hey-hey come on you guys  give him a break. Ross  seriously  how’s it going with her?
Ross, Well  actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious  which is perfect for me right now.
Monica, Well that is great. And seriously  she seems very nice.
Ross, Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all  but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…
Phoebe,  Okay  I got a good one. Okay  umm  what is she? Like 12?
Monica, Chandler  do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Chandler, Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Okay  I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Chandler, Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
Phoebe, Oh that’s good  I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Chandler, Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Phoebe, ‘Cause that’s just your taste.
Monica,  Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.
Phoebe, Oh yeah?
Monica, Yeah!
Phoebe, My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And  he has one of these 
Chandler, A face ass?
Phoebe, A chin dimple!
Monica, Well  uh y’know  our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!
Phoebe, Have you seen your guy’s body?
Chandler, No  our guy is just a floating head.
Phoebe, Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm  when he was on the table  I looked at it. And I mean all of it.
Monica, You’re not supposed to look!
Phoebe, Oh yeah  like there are police for that!
Chandler,  Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.
Phoebe, I know. 
Monica, All right fine  your guy may have a great body  but our guy is really funny.
Phoebe, Oh  Chandler funny?
Monica, Our guy’s a great dancer!
Phoebe, My guy is well read.
Chandler, Our guy has great hair.
Phoebe, My guy has great teeth!
Chandler, Our guy smells incredible.
Monica,  Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Huh.
Chandler, Well  you…don’t look good Joe.
Joey, The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts  ice cream  limes—Hey  what was in that brown jar?
Chandler, That’s still in there?!
Joey, Not anymore. So anyway  how do you want to pay me?
Chandler, Is this a service you’re providing me?
Joey, No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!
Chandler, Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.
Joey, So what? Look  suppose we were a divorced couple.
Chandler, Uh-huh.
Joey, And I got custody of the kid  right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Chandler,  Okay…
Joey,  Give me $400!
Ross, Hmm?  Oh  a student I don’t know.
Ross, Yes  yes of course  what-what would this be regarding?
Ross, Shh!  Of course  why don’t we go inside?
Ross, Oh-ooh!
Ross, Doorknob! Doorknob!
Ross, Oh  okay. What-what about?
Ross, Spring vacation.
Ross,  Yes  professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment.  So  I will take one box of the Thin Mints. 
Ross, You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No  I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?
Chandler, Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
Ross, I can do that. Oh-oh  what if she gets upset?
Chandler, Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Joey, Or! You can just  y’know… 
Ross, What the hell are you doing?
Joey, What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
Ross, What?! What? How do you  how do you even know its broken?!
Joey, Oh-ho-ho  you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!
Chandler, Joey  I saw you push him!
Joey,  You pushed him!
Ross, Joey  I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.
Joey, All right. Chandler  do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Chandler, Uh-huh.
Joey, I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.
Ross, Do not give him any money!
Joey, I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
Ross, Yes. Yes! Please  come in.
Ross, Oo-oo!
Ross, Yeah  it kinda grows on you.  Actually  I wanted to finish talking to you about uh  spring vacation.
Ross, Look  I…  Look  I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So  I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
Ross, No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
Ross, That! Let’s talk about that.
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Ross, Huh? Oh-oh  it was fine. Uh  it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.
Chandler, Wait a minute  is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? 
Ross, What’s-what’s the difference?
Monica, Well  spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.
Ross, Hey  y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
Phoebe, What did you do on yours?
Ross, I went to Egypt with my dad.
Chandler," I can see it now  ""Look dad  it’s the Sphinx!"" "
Ross," Hey  I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than  ""Spring break!""  All right? I mean she’s taken my class!"
Monica, And slept with the professor.
Ross, I’m gonna call her.
Chandler, Yeah.
Rachel, Hey! You guys umm  I want you to meet Sebastian.
Rachel, We just uh  we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream.  What? I read that.
Rachel, Oh yes! Thank you! 
Phoebe, Rachel  what the hell is this?!
Rachel,  What?
Phoebe, You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!
Rachel, You found me a guy?
Monica, Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!
Phoebe, Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
Rachel, Well  y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Chandler, Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
Monica, Uh  would you stop it with that already?!
Rachel, Oh  thank you.
Phoebe, So  Sebastian  do you do any volunteer work?
Phoebe, No reason  it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.
Chandler, Are you funny?
Rachel, What are you guys doing?
Monica, Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Phoebe, Well  so do a lot of people.
Rachel, Oh  but y’know  no  you didn’t give me your phone number.
Chandler,  Turns out he is kinda funny.
Rachel, I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!
Chandler, Yeah  but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
Phoebe," Yeah  y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? ""Hey Sebastian  would you like to dance?""  ""Uhh  okay—I gotta go!"""
Monica, All right guys stop it. Rachel  we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you  we have two really great guys for you.
Phoebe, Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special  if you pick my guy.
Rachel, All right.
Chandler, Okay  so you will meet our guys?
Rachel, Yes  I’ll meet ‘em.
Chandler, Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose  y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect  or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
Joey,  Pheebs! There you are! Okay  you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!
Phoebe, Okay sure!
Joey, Really?!
Phoebe, Ooh  technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.
Joey, Call it even?
Phoebe, Okay.
Chandler,  Well  there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?
Ross, Well  it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means  that means wet T-shirt contests  guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies  waking up next to people you don’t even know…
Joey, Man  she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
Chandler, You know the hotels?
Joey, Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!
Monica, In 1981 you were 13!
Joey, So what? I drove down  sold T-shirts  had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Ross, Okay  she can’t go.
Phoebe, Ross  you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Ross, Then what am I supposed to do?
Phoebe, Nothing  you just have to be cool with it.
Ross, Well  what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Chandler, Well  maybe you don’t marry this one.
Ross, I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!
Ross, Sure. Sure. Look I don’t  I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet  but umm  hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.
Ross, Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, Well  yeah  of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip  and-and  what-what is uh  what’s this? 
Ross, To wear in front of people?
Ross, Is this?!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Good-good-good-good.
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Monica, We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.
Rachel, Oh…
Monica, You’re gonna like him so much. So umm  when do you want to meet him?
Rachel, I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.
Chandler, Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good  but uh  y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now?  Eldad come here! 
Rachel, What?
Monica, Eldad  this is Rachel.
Rachel, Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.
Chandler, Eldad  sit down.  Move over! Move over now!
Rachel, I—Ohh! 
Chandler, There you go! There you are! 
Monica, Okay! Okay! We can take a hint!   What are you doing here?!
Phoebe, This is Patrick. 
Chandler, Hi.  Okay  you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.
Phoebe,  Oh my God  you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking!  Come on!  Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, This is Patrick.
Rachel, Oh  hi.
Phoebe, Yeah  this is the guy I was telling you about.
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Yeah. And believe me  this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.
Rachel, Oh-okay  but Pheebs?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, I’m just sort of in the middle of something.
Phoebe, Oh! Okay! Yeah  that’s okay.  Have a seat. 
Monica, No! You can’t do that!
Monica,  Sit down! We’re winning!
Rachel, Okay  y’know what? Maybe I should go!
Monica, Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!
Chandler, It is the softest hair! Touch it! 
Rachel, Yeah  I’m good.
Phoebe, Rachel? Patrick is really rich.  Give her some money.
Monica, That’s right Patrick  bye-bye!
Chandler,  Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance!  You dance for Rachel!
Rachel, No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t!  What is the matter with you guys?
Phoebe, Yeah  okay  let’s talk it out.
Rachel, I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
Rachel, I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much  but I do not need you to get me a date!
Phoebe, Then why did she ask us to…
Rachel, I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean  no offense to you guys. Really! I mean  congratulations on all the cash   and-and y’know——Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye!  Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!
Rachel, Thank you! 
Ross, So uh  have a great time down there.
Ross, Yeah. And did you  did you pack that bathing suit?
Ross, It was pretty funny when I  when I hid it for a while  huh? Anyway  umm  I-I am worried about that bathing suit  not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with  no I’m concerned about your health  sun exposure.
Ross, Well  if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30  sometimes it’s-it’s get 4  and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.
Ross, Really?
Ross, Okay. Cool.
Ross, Call me!
Phoebe, Rachel  we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.
Rachel, Oh that’s all right! Y’know  I ended up having a really good time. Y’know  the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Chandler, So what was it for anyway?
Rachel, I wanna say a disease.
Joey,  Hey!
Joey, I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
Rachel, Huh. All right.
Phoebe, Oh my God  look! That’s Elizabeth!
Rachel, Oh-oh Professor Geller.
Joey, Ahh  to be 13 again.
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds  we’re never gonna make it!
Phoebe, You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Joey, No! I won’t leave you!
Phoebe, Don’t worry about me  I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!
Joey, No you’re not! Not to me!
Phoebe,  Oh my God.
Joey, What?
Phoebe, I am extremely talented!
Joey, Yeah  you’re great! Okay  let’s take it from…
Phoebe,  No  I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Joey, Yeah  I thought I was pretty good too.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  you’re solid. Yeah  you’re just no me.
Joey, Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.
Phoebe,  Fine! I’ll do it without you!  I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own!  You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!
Chandler,  So uh  what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?
Joey," Oh  it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah  I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a  he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E."""
Rachel, So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey, That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Chandler, That is lucky.
Rachel, Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this  you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese!  Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!
Joey, Well  don’t get your hopes up  because probably not gonna happen.
Chandler, Now-now  why would you say that Joseph?
Joey, I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.
Phoebe, I am.
Rachel, Joey  what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
Joey, You really think so?
Rachel, Ugh  how can you even ask that question?!
Chandler,  Whoa  she's pretty. 
Joey,  Yeah  and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras  and smell-the-fart acting.
Rachel,  I'm sorry  what?
Monica,  What?
Ross,  Excuse me?
Joey,  It's like  you got so many lines to learn so fast  that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it  you take this big pause where you look all intense  you know  like this. 
Chandler,  Oh  ok.
Joey,"  There's my scene  there's my scene.  ""Mrs. Wallace  I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray  your sister's neurosurgeon.  I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."" "
Joey,  Vell  Eva  ve've done some excellent vork here  and I vould have to say  your pwoblem is qviiite clear. 
Joey,  I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower  and then- I'm his butt.
Monica,  Oh my God.
Joey,  C'mon  you guys. This is a real movie  and Al Pacino's in it  and that's big!
Chandler, Oh no  it's terrific  it's- it's- y'know  you deserve this  after all your years of struggling  you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
Joey, Okay  okay  fine! Make jokes  I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Ross, You're right  you're right  it is.
Monica,  Yes.
Ross,  So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Joey, All right well  I’m outta here. Wish me luck.
Phoebe,   Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Joey, Yeah  whatever. 
Ross, It’s your turn.
Chandler, Oh  are we playing this?!
Joey,  Hey.
Chandler, Hey! How’d the audition go?
Joey, Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!
Ross, Wait a minute  are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
Joey, Yeah  did I fool ya?
Ross, Totally!
Chandler, So it did go well.
Joey, Oh  it went amazingly well!
Ross, Great!
Chandler, Oh that’s great!
Joey, Yeah-yeah  it’s down to me and two other guys.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Ross, Wow!
Joey, And I know both of them  they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…
Ross, Oh  I love that guy! 
Chandler, Oh-oh  what are you doing?
Ross,  What am I doing?
Joey, I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Chandler, Well  it is overdue.
Ross, Look  don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
Joey, There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense  but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
Ross, Yeah  none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Chandler,  Yes  Fran. I know what time it is  but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Monica,  Alright  well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Monica,  Oh-oh  no no don't worry  I'm gonna wash it.
Monica,  That's your call.
Monica,  Well  I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Monica,  They'r alright.
Monica,  No really  they're OK.
Monica,  Actually  I was gonna do them jullienne.
Monica,  I'm outa here. 
Rachel,   Monica  I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!  Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye  call me when you get this message. 
Monica,  Well  what happened?
Phoebe,  Well  he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... 
Ross,  Oh my God!
Phoebe,  And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. 
Monica,  Was it...
Phoebe,  Oh  Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Ross, You ate my sandwich?
Ross,  Oh-oh really?
Ross,  What?
Ross, You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Ross,   MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross, MY SANDWICH!!!!!! 
Joey, I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No  I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.
Chandler, Oh come on guys  it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for  Monica’s allergies.  You’re right  I could never lie to you. She hates you.  Should I get that?  Hello?  Uh no  Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message?  Yeah  okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?  Okay great.  Bye. 
Monica,  Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
Chandler,  Am I naked again?!
Monica, We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Chandler, Yeah okay  I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean  is it okay if they come visit?
Monica, Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Chandler, Oh right  your allergies.  All her  she hates you. 
Joey, Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Chandler, As crazy as soccer?
Joey,  Hello?  What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00!  Well  nobody told me!  Who’d you talk to?  Nevermind! 
Chandler, You mean you didn’t get it from this?
Joey, The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Chandler, Well  maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Joey, How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!
Chandler, I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry  I really messed up.
Joey, Hey  you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Chandler, Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look  if there was anything I could do  I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake  right?
Chandler,  You know he coulda gotten me a VCR  he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs  but no  he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Phoebe,  It's not that bad.
Chandler,  Oh  yeah  easy for you to say  you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
Phoebe,  Chandler  Chandler.
Chandler,  I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry  I do  I do. I pity the fool that. . .  Hi!
Chandler,  Yeah  I mean when you were late last night  Kathy and I got to talking  and one thing to another and…
Joey,  And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler,  No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey,  What?!! That’s even worse!!
Chandler,  How is that worse?!
Joey,  I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Chandler,  You’re right  I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey,  Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line  that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler, Look  I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
Joey, Name one!
Chandler,  What happened?!!
Joey,  Awww  man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
Chandler,  What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey,  Well  this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler,  So--You got in voluntarily?!
Joey,  I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh  man  if I ever run into that guy again  do you know what I’m gonna do?
Chandler,  BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler, Ok  now  remember  no trading. You get the pretty one  I get the mess.
Chandler, ...And what did you bring?
Chandler, Janice?
Chandler, Janice?!
Chandler, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross, What?
Joey, No way!  I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler, Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam  and he ran his hand up my leg  and then  there was definite...
Ross, What?
Chandler, Cupping.
Joey, That's how they do pants!  Ross  will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Ross, Yes  yes it is. In prison!
Joey, I said name one!
Chandler, I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
Monica, Oh  stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…
Chandler, Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
Rachel, Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Chandler, Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
Rachel, Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
Monica, Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case…  Okay…
Chandler, You didn’t see how mad he was  y’know?
Rachel, I’m sure he will forgive you. Look  we have all been there! Y’know  you fight  you make up  it’s just the way it works.
Ross, It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Rachel, Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place  which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Ross, I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Rachel, What?!!
Ross, I fell asleep!
Rachel,  You fell asleep?!
Ross, It was 5:30 in the morning  and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!   Oh-oh-oh  and by the way  Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are ’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Rachel, Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross,  FINE BY ME!! 
Rachel, And hey! Just so you know  it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler,  I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica, You had no right to go out with him.
Rachel, That is the most ridiculous...
Monica, You sold me out.
Rachel, I did not sell you out.
Monica, Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...
Rachel, Would you let me talk. 
Monica, Did you just flick me?
Rachel, OK  well  you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus-  Ow. That hurt 
Phoebe, Oh!  All right.  Now  let's not do this!
Phoebe, Happy thoughts!  Happy thoughts!
Phoebe, OK  now I'm gonna kick some ass.
Phoebe, I know!  I know!  I know!
Phoebe, Alright  now I will let go if you both stop.
Rachel, Fine!
Monica, Fine!
Phoebe, There we go.You know what  if we were in prison  you guys would be  like  my bitches.
Joey, Okay  buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes  I'm wearing everything you own.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Joey, Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Joey, Yeah. Whew  it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah  I better not do any  I don't know  lunges. 
Chandler, Joey? Got you a Joey Special  two pizzas! Joe?   Hello?  Damnit!  Hello?  No  Joey’s not here right now  but I can take a message I think.  He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh  that’s great news!  Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.  Oh well  that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you!  Yes!  Okay  Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked.  By dog not flowers.
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Please tell me you got the message!
Joey, What message?
Chandler, The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it  they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
Joey, What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
Chandler, Du-du-I wrote it  I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board  then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Joey, I can’t believe this Chandler!
Chandler, Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
Joey, Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Chandler,  Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Joey, Oh  well I’m uh…
Chandler, Y’know  sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Joey, Oh wow! Okay man  I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Chandler, Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!
Joey,  That’s mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler, Oh  we could do this all day.
Joey, Yeah  you’re right. Okay look  listen  let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!
Chandler, You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
Joey, You hug me!
Chandler, All right!
Joey, Hey  do we do this too much?
Chandler, I think so. Yeah  get off me.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Come on C.H.E.E.S.E.  I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Phoebe,  I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
Joey, Wow!  Well then I’ll just have to carry you.
Ross, That’ll be a neat trick  when you’re   when you’re dead!
Joey, Ross  you don’t have to yell.
Ross, There was just an explosion  okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Phoebe," I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like  ""Ooh  where’d Ross go?"""
Ross, Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
Phoebe, Yeah?
Ross, Oh my God. I mean…
Joey, Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! 
Phoebe,  He’s holding us back.
Ross, Totally.
Rachel, Okay  Chandler!
Chandler, Okay.
Rachel," And your horoscope says  ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."""
Chandler,  Oh  well thank you in advance. 
Rachel, Op  but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.
Monica,  You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Rachel, Oh  wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Joey,  Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey!!
Rachel,  Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!
Chandler, Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Joey, Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I’ve dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
Phoebe, No! Joey  you’re going to be great!
Joey, But I got to act with a robot Pheebs  and-and I don’t know anything about technology! I can’t even use Chandler’s computer except to find porn! And-and that’s only ‘cause it’s right there when you turn it on!
Monica, I think our lover’s spat will start a little early this month.
Phoebe,  I’ll be waiting.
Chandler, Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.
Phoebe, No  I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!
Rachel, Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Phoebe, Well  if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them  I can tell you that they all have been very well received.
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, What are you guys doing later?
Phoebe, Oh  Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Rachel,  We do?
Phoebe, I want to see what he wants first.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross,  I just found out that Elizabeth’s dad wants to meet me.
Chandler, Wait a minute  hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!
Ross, Come on guys  I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Ross, Thanks!
Monica, We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Joey, Wow! Huh?  Mac Macaveli  Private Investigator!
Joey, Okay. Hey uh  when do I get to meet the robot?
Joey, Okay.
Joey, Oh wow! He’s so lifelike!  Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears.
Joey,  How do you do there  Wayne? 
Joey, Okay. Sorry about that… Uh  so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?
Joey,  This is like the temporary robot  right?
Joey, Well  I-I just  I just it was going to be like a really cool robot  y’know? Like the terminator or uh  when I first saw you.
Joey, I’m sorry  it just—I don’t know it doesn’t really look like it can do anything.
Ross, It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
Ross, Of course  of course  Mr. Stevens.
Ross, Eh-wh—Excuse me?
Ross, That’s funny. Umm….  It’s not funny.
Ross, Okay. I can  I can see that. Umm  but I think if you give me umm  one chance I can  I can change your mind.
Ross, What?
Ross, This is—you—
Ross, Okay  umm I want you to know that I have never done anything like this before. I mean  I mean I’ve been in um  relationships in general  uh but I have never done it with a student—I mean I not—not it! I mean  I mean I don’t—We haven’t done it. Uh  I mean  I mean  we’ve-we’ve-we’ve done stuff.  Okay  okay  a joke  a joke—lighten the mood. Umm  two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
Ross, And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Monica, Ross!!
Chandler, Ross!
Monica, How crazy that we’d run into you!
Ross, Oh God  thank you!  Umm  uh  Mr. Stevens I’d like you to meet my friends uh  this is Phoebe  Monica  and Chandler.
Phoebe, You’re Elizabeth’s father  huh? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.
Monica,  Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Chandler, There’s a Mr. Bing!
Ross, Okay umm  why don’t we all take a seat  y’know? And uh  and I’ll get us all some uh some coffees——Yeah  why don’t you.  Uh and you guys can talk about whatever  whatever you want. Y’know? Whatever pops into your head. 
Monica, Y’know  it is so strange seeing Ross here this time of day  ‘cause usually he’s got the children’s hospital.
Phoebe, Yeah. Not looking for dates. 
Monica, And he’s a great brother!
Monica, Ohh!
Chandler, But uh Ross  Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh  funny story…  You’re roommate in college died didn’t he?
Ross,  Okay here we are Paul  Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Chandler, Yes  we were just…
Rachel, Hi  I’m sorry I’m late but I am ready  ready to talk you up! When does Liz’s father get here?
Rachel, Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Chandler, Hey honey  you got the kind with the little girl  you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Monica, No  you said the baby creeps you out.
Chandler, No  the little girl creeps me out.
Monica, You said the baby.
Chandler, Why would the baby creep me out?
Monica, Why would the little girl creep you out?
Phoebe,  You guys  I’m sorry  could you please talk a little slower?
Chandler, This is going in your book?
Phoebe, Yeah  it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps  the pitfalls  what not to do  keep going. This stuff is great!
Monica, What?! Excuse me!
Phoebe, And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.  And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it’s a compliment.
Rachel,  Oh hi!
Rachel, Oh! Well let’s look for them.  Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?
Rachel, All right! 
Rachel, Oh good.
Rachel,  Oh  wait! Sorry  Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Rachel, Paul. Umm  I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Rachel, You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.
Rachel, Oh. We?
Rachel, Oh no! Yes! Of course  I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’
Rachel,  Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Rachel, Ohh.  Ooh!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, How was your first day?
Joey, Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Chandler, Damn those robots  they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!
Joey, Anyway  it wasn’t the robot  it was the guy who controls him. Yeah  he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!
Phoebe, Well  why don’t you just get him fired?
Joey, I may have to  I hate to do it  but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Excuse me.  Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, Wow!
Joey, I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
Ross, Joey?!
Rachel, I was just getting him to like you.
Ross, Joey?! Joey!! 
Rachel, Ross  Joey is not here.
Ross, Okay  I’ll just wait for him in here!
Rachel, Ross  it’s okay. You can come out.
Ross,  Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!
Rachel, Bye!
Ross, What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Rachel, Well  y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
Ross,  In your mouth?!
Rachel, No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know  for like two hours  and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
Ross, You were at the coffeehouse!
Rachel, Ross  what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
Ross, He is my girlfriend’s father  okay? It’s-it’s  it’s weird!
Rachel, Wh—You dated my sister!
Ross, That was different!
Rachel, What? Why?!
Ross, This is weird for me!
Rachel, Ross look  look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it  so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner  y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross  the guy is a very  very successful lawyer!
Ross, How is that important?
Rachel, Oh it’s important!
Joey, Apparently  there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac  and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?
Monica, Well y’know Joey  you’re a pretty charming guy.
Joey, Thanks  but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Monica, No sweetie  you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Joey, That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay  but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well  actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs. 
Chandler, So do you think uh  Joey’s more charming than me?
Monica, Yeah! That’s why I’m sleeping with him on the side.
Chandler, Yeah  you wish. 
Phoebe,"  ""You wish."""
Monica, Phoebe  stop writing about us!
Phoebe, I’m not writing about you! I’m writing about other people.
Chandler, Who?
Phoebe, Marcia and Chester.
Monica, Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what  I’ll just write about Phyllis! Hmm!
Chandler, Hmm.
Monica,  Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler, Oh.
Phoebe, I see what you’re doing!
Monica,  Phyllis sees what I’m doing.
Chandler, Oh-oh.
Phoebe, Ooh  I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Joey, Morning! Hey  how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?! 
Joey, Okay!  All right. Umm  all right Wayne  level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay  they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man  you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean  I love-I love this little guy!  Ah-ah!!  Okay  that’s why you didn’t want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay?  Stupid! I can’t believe it! God!   Hey  how you doin’? 
Rachel, So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up  so Ross selflessly  offered to take me.
Rachel, Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
Ross, Yeah  take your time.
Ross,  Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…
Ross, Not all bad.
Ross, Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Ross, No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son  who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Ross, Yeah  well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm  uh  and just so you know  Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife!  Oh  I’m sorry!  It’s unbelievable!
Rachel, Oh we were  but that was just a   I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Ross, You’re back.
Rachel, Oh! Whoops! I’m sorry  you were talking about Emily!
Monica, Chandler  we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler, We said seven!
Monica, We said six!
Chandler, The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s  let meet at seven  not at six.
Monica," Yeah and if I had seven  maybe I would’ve said something like this  ""Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"""
Phoebe,  Hi!
Chandler, Oh my good God.
Monica, Ugh!
Phoebe, I know what time you said.
Chandler, What?!
Phoebe, Well actually  I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Monica, What time?
Phoebe, Quite an interesting turn of events  suddenly it’s my book to the rescue  huh?  Ooh  very interesting. Yeah  well this certainly clears things up.
Chandler,  What does it say?!
Phoebe, I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler, Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh  great book and you are the queen of everything.
Phoebe, Thanks! So are you.
Chandler,  I told you I should not wear this color. 
Phoebe,  Mon…  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks they’re supposed to meet at six  Chester thinks it’s at seven.
Chandler, So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Phoebe, That’s right.
Monica, Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Phoebe,  Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Joey, I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!
Chandler, Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Joey, Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Joey, Yeah? Well  I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh  Chandler  Wayne. Wayne  Chandler. 
Chandler, Hi  how are ya?
Joey,  Why should I help you?!
Chandler,  The reason he just said.
Joey,  What do you need?
Joey, Yeah?
Joey, What are you in love with her or something?
Chandler, Yeah  I’ve been there my friend.
Joey, Oh wow Wayne  it’s not really something you can teach y’know? It’s pretty much something you’re born with if you——You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.
Rachel, I mean if you think about it  I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Rachel, Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily  he just didn’t tell me.  Maybe I have to pee again. 
Ross, Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know  I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me  frankly…
Ross, God no!
Ross, Well if it doesn’t matter to her  it doesn’t matter to me!  Still not yelling!
Ross, That’s okay  I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
Ross, Uh yeah  I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
Ross, Ohhh! Kids!
Rachel,  Wait-wait-wait  I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Ross, That’s okay Rach  we’re not liking Ross right now.
Rachel, Oh! I’ve got a lot of those too!
Joey, Well  it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey, You got it! And the rabbi’s beard  100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  It’s your line C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!
Phoebe,  Hi  you guys.
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hi!
Rachel, What’s the matter?
Phoebe, Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
Joey,  Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
Phoebe, No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
Chandler, I’ll give up my ticket.
Joey, Me too.
Phoebe, Okay that’s so generous!
Chandler, And I think Ross is generous too.
Phoebe, Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, So what-what is the exhibit.
Phoebe, It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Joey, Oh man! 
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
Ross, Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Monica, Oh that’s great!
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
Ross, Why? What?
Monica, Well  her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
Ross, No  no  that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on  let it go  y’know? Stop it! Besides  Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father  so ah  he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils  huh?
Rachel, I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Ross, Okay  okay. Uh  well uh  Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.
Chandler, Ross.
Ross, Oh  come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know  ‘cause-‘cause y’know  ‘cause he’s all old  and…
Ross, Really? That okay  that’s great.
Ross, All right look  I-I realize it upsets you.
Ross, But  Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
Ross, Ohh! A man with a plan!
Phoebe, Oh  this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
Joey, I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him  that smug Belushi bastard  I’ll…
Phoebe,  Ohh  okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him  smiling at me.  Yeah I know; we’d be great together!
Joey, Hey! So I’m back.
Joey, Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Okay  maybe this will jog your memory  huh?  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway  I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.
Joey, Oh well  it’s not on TV yet.
Joey, Okay  fine  I will bring you a tape  huh? 
Phoebe, So umm  now do you have any of Matt Lauer’s clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven’t been cleaned yet?
Monica, Oh  I love museums!
Rachel, Umm.
Monica, Soakin’ up all the culture.
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, Where do you want to start?
Rachel, Ooh  the gift shop!
Monica, Yeah!
Phoebe, Hey  and then lunch.
Rachel, Oh  wait yes  but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight  he said he has a big surprise planned.
Phoebe, Oh wow. What  do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
Rachel, What?! No! Why?!
Phoebe, No reason! That would just be a really big surprise  right?
Rachel, I didn’t know you could get married here.
Monica, This would be a beautiful place to get married  yeah  but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!  I mean you’d have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch. 
Rachel, Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
Rachel, Monica  you should totally put your name down on the list
Monica, What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.
Phoebe, Yeah  but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else  y’know? Someone  someone who did put their name on the list. 
Rachel, Yeah hon  it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
Monica, Well  I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
Rachel, I’m gonna do it too!
Phoebe, Me too!
Rachel, Really? Who would  who would you marry?
Phoebe, I don’t know  I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
Rachel, Oh Pheebs.
Phoebe, Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
Monica, Phoebe  that stuff is…
Phoebe, Don’t even get me started on yours!
Joey,  Hey! So  did you watch the tape of my show?
Joey, All right  let’s get me back up there! 
Joey, What—But you saw the show!
Joey, Dry cleaners?
Joey, Okay! Okay  look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
Joey, Okay well that may be true. But  in-in okay  Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.
Joey, Oh you should  it’s great.
Ross, This place is really beautiful!
Ross, Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs  but  but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?
Ross, Ehh  I was just  I was just thinking about your father.
Ross, No. No-no uh  he just  he just really freaked me out before.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross,  Why?! Are there like bears or something?!  Ohh. Oh  protection. Yeah-no  yeah-no  that-that-that I forgot.
Ross, Oh no! Hey-hey  I’m the guy! I’ll get it.
Ross, No.
Ross, A little bit.
Ross, Okay.
Ross, Ohh  okay.
Rachel,  Oh my God  what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Chandler,  You’ve reached Monica and Chandler’s  if you’re listening to this message  we’re probably screening.  Yeah we are.
Chandler,  This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes  the groom—No! Not the groom!!
Rachel, It’s so secluded up here.
Rachel, I feel like we’re the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry. 
Rachel, No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually  would you go check on that?
Rachel, Well  okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Rachel, Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!
Ross, What are you doing here?!
Rachel, I came with Paul!
Ross, Yeah  I recognize the ankles!
Rachel, Get up!
Rachel, Ahh. Thank you!
Rachel, Op  ice. I need ice.
Rachel, Thank you.
Ross,  You and your ice.
Rachel, Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!  No! Not in there! He’s in there! 
Ross,  Did you really hear a bear?
Rachel, Go-go!
Rachel, Ohh  thank you.
Rachel, Well  she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.
Rachel, Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Rachel, Well  why do y’know go in that room  and do your homework?
Rachel, That’s your  that’s your dad’s bedroom.  That’s your dad’s bedroom!
Rachel, Whoa  that Diet Coke just went straight to my head! Woo!
Monica, Hi  honey.
Chandler,  See you later. 
Monica, What? I-I bought groceries  I was gonna make you dinner!
Chandler,  Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask! 
Monica, Oh no!
Monica, Oh please  he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!
Chandler,  This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! 
Monica, NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Joey, Uh yeah  where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?
Joey, Oh  you’re kidding me! All-all right  well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Joey, Oh really? Well  maybe you and I go out for drinks?  You’re the other one right? 
Rachel, Really? Okay. Okay  I-I’ll go upstairs.  If-if you get me something from the car.
Rachel, Surprise me.
Rachel,  So you’re gonna be in the car  I will be upstairs  and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Yeah?
Monica, Have you seen Chandler?!
Phoebe, No! Why?
Monica, The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!  I know! How bad is this?!
Phoebe, Well for the regular guy  it’s bad  but Chandler  Oh dear God!
Monica, I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!
Phoebe, What are you gonna do?
Monica," Well  I’m never gonna listen to you again  that’s for sure!  ""Y’know  harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
Phoebe, Rachel said that!
Monica, Well Rachel’s not here! 
Phoebe," Oh! Here it is!  Ooh  Joey! Why did you sign it  ""Son of a bitch?"" "
Joey, I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
Phoebe, Okay  maybe ask this guy.
Phoebe, Well  what did he do?
Phoebe, Joey!
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa  I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!  Okay? I went out with her! 
Phoebe, Well  we should go.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Elizabeth!  Okay. Okay.  I’m gonna go out this window.  I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home  okay?
Rachel,  Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
Rachel, Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
Ross,  And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross, Okay  please-please Paul  just let me explain…
Ross, All right  fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh  I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean  I too am a neat guy. 
Ross, And I too am just a love machine. 
Monica,  I’m so sorry. Please  stop freaking out.
Chandler, I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married  but that happens everyday. 
Monica, Honey  we were at this beautiful place  and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean  what’s the harm in that?
Chandler, Right here! 
Monica, Chandler  please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…
Chandler, Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you  Phoebe and Rachel  Heldi  and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
Monica, It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything  because it doesn’t.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yes  if it really doesn’t mean anything  because you know that I’m just not ready…
Monica, I know! I know.
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, I’m gonna go tell Joey that  that you’re back. I was really worried about you. 
Phoebe,  Hey  did she buy it?
Chandler, Totally.
Phoebe, So did Heldi show you the place?
Chandler, Yeah  it’s beautiful.
Phoebe, I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
Chandler, I know.
Joey, Hey Gunther.
Joey, Oh uh  well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Joey, No! No  I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.
Joey, Great! 
Chandler, Pheebs  can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!
Phoebe, Now  have you told anyone else?
Chandler, No  I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.
Phoebe, You told me.
Chandler, Well  it’s because I trust you  you’re one of my best friends  and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Phoebe, Yeah well  once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
Chandler, Me too.
Joey, Hey. 
Chandler, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey! So Chandler  wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Chandler, Oh all right.
Phoebe, Yeah  coffeehouse.
Ross, Oh perfect  we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Chandler, Oh well  we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.
Ross, How rude.
Joey, Oh  I’m sorry. You wanna bite? 
Phoebe, So how are things going with Paul?
Rachel, Good. Although y’know  he-he’s a private guy. Y’know  I wish I could get him to open up a little bit  share some feelings.
Phoebe, That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.
Rachel, So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
Phoebe, No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe,  Watch this.
Rachel,  Okay.
Phoebe, Hi Paul!
Phoebe, So how are things going with you?
Rachel, Okay. 
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Great to see you!
Ross, How you doing?
Ross, Okay! You take care!
Ross, Hey Pheebs  what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Phoebe, Yeah! That was so weird  huh?
Ross, Phoebe  why’d you do it?
Phoebe, I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!
Ross, What?! Why?!
Phoebe, Please  I think you know why.
Ross, I can’t think of anything.
Phoebe, Come on Ross  you’re a paleontologist  dig a little deeper.
Ross, Wait a minute  is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Phoebe, Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?
Ross, I guess it could.
Phoebe, Well then I think that’s it.
Ross, Well  if he’s angry  he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Phoebe, Oh  if that’s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
Rachel, Yeah that’s great. But first  wait  talk to me  talk to me. Tell me about your day.
Rachel, Okay. Hey  what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
Rachel, Yeah that’s great Paul  but y’know I wanna know what——Wow  those are really great! I just wanna know what  what is behind this-this strong  silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Rachel, No Paul  I don’t know anything about you! Y’know  like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Rachel, Okay  well then how about puberty! Come on  that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Rachel, Well  you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway  umm… The rest of you life  y’know? Any regrets?
Rachel, All right Paul  I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, All right.
Rachel, Hm-mmm.
Rachel, That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay  come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go. 
Rachel, Oh!
Rachel, Yeah. Yeah  I-I-I see the scare. Listen  Paul  I think this is really great that-that y’know  you shared your feelings. It’s really  it’s beautiful  but umm  what do you say we go share some food?
Rachel, What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Rachel, My God  I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
Chandler, Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  It’s a beautiful selection. 
Phoebe, Okay  so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet  y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Chandler, Y’know  I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Phoebe, Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Chandler, Yeah  I’m gonna stick with the ring.  Oh  this one’s nice!  I like this one! Sir? Uh  kind sir? Can I see this one?
Phoebe,  Wait a minute  no  this is  this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Chandler, Uh-uh  yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Phoebe, Or not  whatever.
Chandler, Sir  can I ask you to umm  could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Chandler,  Oh my God that’s it  that’s the ring! How much is it?
Phoebe, Chandler  I-I will handle this!  How much is it?
Phoebe, We will give you $10.
Chandler, Yes! Yes  but I can only pay $8 000.
Phoebe, We stand firm at $10.
Chandler, Uh  credit card.  Oh no! No-no  but I left my credit card with Joey.  Okay  I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.
Phoebe, Okay.  Listen  I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Phoebe, I’ll give you $1 for them.
Ross, Hey  remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
Joey, No.
Ross, Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Okay. Well  apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
Joey, Oh  we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Ross, Yeah! Anyway  I-I still think we should try to patch things up  y’know? Like uh  maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Joey, Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Ross, Oh. 
Joey, Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho  I got this one. Here you go.  Y’know I gotta tell ya  sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know  me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.
Ross, All the time?
Joey, All the time!
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Monica, Still crying?
Rachel, Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God  I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy  clingy  moist monster!
Monica, Y’know  I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Rachel, What’s the other one?
Monica, I don’t know  I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know  if we’re having sex  he’s not gonna be talking.
Rachel, Oh that’s right. You’re the talker.  Anyway uh  great idea! Umm  I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Monica, Oh  we have some…
Rachel, No you don’t!
Phoebe, Okay umm  I’d also like to try on the tiara.  Oh yeah. Okay.   What do you think  too much?
Phoebe, Okay. Then  take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh  let me see the ring my friend picked out.
Phoebe, Oh my God!!  No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now! 
Chandler, No. How are ya Paul? 
Chandler, No  did he hug you?!
Chandler, Well  you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Chandler, Yeah?
Chandler, I’m a little busy here Paul.
Chandler, Okay  a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay. 
Chandler, Okay! 
Joey,  Hey!
Joey, Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi  Paul is it? 
Chandler, Do you have my credit card?
Joey, Yes  it’s in my… In…in my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket!
Chandler, Thank God! 
Joey, Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Chandler, Oh  I can’t go.
Joey, Come on! It’ll be fun! Me  you  and Ross  and… Paul probably…
Phoebe, Chandler  I found the perfect ring. 
Chandler, Oh  that’s uh  that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
Phoebe, Oh my God Chandler  the one you picked is gone. It’s over!
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
Chandler, They put you in jail?
Phoebe, The little jail between the doors!
Chandler, Phoebe  I asked you to guard the ring!
Phoebe, I know  I’m sorry! But y’know  this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Chandler, Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Phoebe, Maybe it was the guy.
Chandler, It was the ring!
Ross, Hey! So uh  was he excited about the tickets?
Joey, No! He blew us off!
Ross, What?!
Joey, I know!
Ross, I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.
Joey, Can I tell you something? Me too.
Ross, Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry  well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!
Joey, Ooooh! Freeze him out.
Ross, That’s right!
Joey, I like it!
Ross, Eh? We’ll show him!
Joey, From now on  it’s gonna be Joey and Ross  best friends.  Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Rachel, Hi. I’m back.
Rachel, Ah that’s great. No actually that’s…  That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know  I gotta tell ya writing  I mean writing  gets me uh  gets me kinda hot.
Rachel, A lover?
Rachel, Oh yeah surfer?
Rachel, Okay  hold on real quick  hold on a second let me just uh   get a little more comfortable here. Wait  now wait a second  this isn’t too revealing is it?
Rachel, I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know  the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2 000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
Rachel, Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.
Rachel, I’m so glad  I’m so glad you shared.  And I’m glad that you’re done. What do you say we umm… 
Phoebe,  Hey.
Chandler, I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Phoebe, It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!
Chandler, No  it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her  y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring  all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look  this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
Phoebe, Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
Chandler, I can’t do that.
Phoebe, Well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring.
Phoebe, There he is! 
Chandler, Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Phoebe, Wow! You’re good! After this  we should solve crimes.
Chandler, Yeah! Okay  go  go  go get him.
Phoebe, Oh  okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
Phoebe, It is your office.
Phoebe, John?
Phoebe,  Here he is.
Chandler,  Hi! Hi. Okay  there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store  the ring you’re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So  I’m gonna need to have that back.  But  in exchange I’m willing to trade you this beautiful  more expensive ring.  Ew.
Phoebe, Wow! I would trade.
Chandler, No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
Phoebe, Yeah  do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?
Chandler, Yeah  she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
Phoebe, Yes  and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See  if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…
Chandler,  Okay  that’s enough honey!
Chandler, Great! Okay  here. 
Chandler, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!
Chandler, Guys?  I’ve got something important to tell ya.  Guys?  Guys?!  I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Joey,  I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Ross, Wait a minute  is this  is this for real?
Chandler, Yeah  check out the ring. 
Joey, Oh my God!!
Ross, So you two are really serious?!
Chandler, Yep  pretty much.
Ross, You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law! 
Joey, And-and-and-and-and-and  and we’re gonna be friends again!
Chandler,  Heyyyy—What?
Joey, Oh it’s water under the bridge  forget it!
Chandler, Okay!  I was gonna wait ‘til uh  it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.
Joey, I think I’m gonna cry!
Rachel,  Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby  I’ll dump you too!
Chandler, I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!!  You guys are gonna be so happy!
Chandler, I know.
Joey,  Where’s all the tissues?! 
Chandler, Check out the ring.
Rachel,  Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Phoebe,  Hi.
Ross, Hey-hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, What?
Ross, Chandler’s gonna ask Monica to marry him!
Phoebe, Oh I know  I helped pick out the ring.
Ross, You told her before you told us?
Chandler, Well  she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that  right?  Guys? Guys? 
Ross, God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Rachel, Yeah? Well  you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.
Ross, Yeah  you didn’t get one.
Chandler, Okay  well tonight’s the big night.
Phoebe, Yeah!
Joey, Okay listen  how are you gonna ask her?
Chandler, It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full  instead of proposing a toast I’m just gonna propose.
Rachel, Ohh…
Joey, That sounds perfect!
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, You’re gonna mess it up let me do it.
Chandler, I’m not gonna mess it up.
Phoebe, If she says no  can I have the ring?
Chandler, She’s not gonna say no.
Phoebe, If!
Monica,  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe,  Hi Monica.
Chandler,  Give me it!
Phoebe, It’s gone.
Chandler, Phoebe!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler,  Hi Monica.
Phoebe,  We’re practically kissing. 
Rachel,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey Rach!
Rachel, Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring  the better I look. So  Monica? Chandler?
Chandler,  Well  Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!
Rachel, Oh my God  I’m so sorry.
Monica, What’s the big deal?
Chandler, I just get mad when Rachel doesn’t remember where we’re going.
Joey, Where are you going?
Rachel, How about you guys? 
Phoebe, Open bar?
Rachel, I think so.
Phoebe, I can do that for the kids.
Joey, Hey  y’know what? I’ll come too. I’m making money now; it’s about time I give something back.
Chandler, Well  you could also give back the money you owe me.
Joey, Okay. Have a benefit.
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey! Ross  listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
Ross, Oh no  I have plans with Elizabeth.
Chandler, Oh  so you’re already doing your part for the kids.
Ross, I’m sorry  it’s just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp—to be a counselor!
Monica, Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside  where is this relationship going?
Chandler, Wait a minute  all jokes aside? I didn’t agree to that!
Monica, Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
Ross, I don’t know.
Phoebe, Y’know  you are 12 years older than her.
Ross, Wait a minute  does-does everyone feel this way?
Ross, Uh-uh—Wow! Uh  I thought you guys were just like making jokes  I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes  there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides  it doesn’t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean  I’m the one dating Elizabeth  not you!
Joey, That’s not what she said last night. 
Rachel, See? Now  he could date her.
Chandler, Will you marry me? Will you marry me?  Hey  you marry me!  What’s going on little elves?
Joey, It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Ross, Yeah  yeah you have the ring?
Chandler, Yeah  right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?
Phoebe, Oh! Oop! 
Chandler, Okay  now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.

Monica, Hi guys.
Chandler,  You are beautiful.
Monica, Oh  thank you!   What’s going on?
Rachel,  We’re just really…very excited about this charity event that we have to go to.
Phoebe, Here.
Rachel, Oh! Thank you!
Phoebe, So now what’s going on here?
Rachel, Uh well  uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Phoebe, No  I know what a silent is I meant  what’s going on with your hair?
Rachel,  Uh  wh-why?
Phoebe, No! It’s nice!
Rachel, Oh  hi!

Rachel, What are you doing?
Phoebe, Open bar!
Rachel, Well now it’s an empty bar.
Phoebe, You just can’t stand anyone else enjoying themselves can’t you?
Joey, I won! That was my guess!
Rachel, What?! What?! What?!
Joey, I guessed 20 000!
Rachel, Joey! It is an auction! You don’t guess  you buy!
Joey, What?! I don’t have 20 000!
Rachel, Joey! Sit down! 
Phoebe, Forget her! You enjoy this!! 
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler,  One nation  under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  I remembered it.  The champagne is here. 
Monica, Are you okay?
Chandler, Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
Monica, Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold  can I have your jacket?
Chandler, Oh  yeah.  Uh  no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold  you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh  other than that  are you okay? Are you okay?
Monica,  Are you sure you’re okay?
Chandler, Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think  the reason is you.
Monica, Ohh that’s sweet!
Chandler, Okay umm  before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…
Monica,  Oh my God!
Chandler,  I know  but just let me say it.
Monica, Oh my God  Richard. 
Chandler, What?! I’m Chandler!  Oh  that’s Richard!
Monica, Oh God  maybe he won’t see us. Richard!
Chandler, Hey-hey  hey!  I don’t know why I did that!
Monica, Hey  it’s good to see you!
Monica, Yeah—Oh that’s right. You  you always wanted me too. Hey  I see you got your mustache back.
Chandler,  And uh  you don’t have a mustache which is good.  I’m Chandler; I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable.
Chandler, Hi.
Chandler, Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I  did it again.
Monica, Chandler  wh-why don’t we sit down?
Chandler, Yeah  I’ll sit down. 
Monica,  It’s good to see you
Chandler, Yes. 
Rachel, What were you thinking?!
Joey, I didn’t know it was an auction!
Rachel, Wh?!
Joey, I figured  take a guess  help a charity  free boat!
Rachel, Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Joey, I don’t know! Charity?
Rachel, Ugh!
Phoebe, Well  just buy the damn boat! 
Rachel, Phoebe  don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
Phoebe, I’m just helping the kids!
Rachel, How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe, Because the more I drink  the less there is for the kids to drink.
Joey, Oh hi!
Joey, Just out of curiosity  how-how much is that boat worth?
Joey,  Hey  I was pretty close.  Uhh  so bad news. Umm  I can’t buy the boat  I don’t have any money.
Rachel, Joey! Joey  good one! 
Joey, So uh listen  I think I’m gonna take off now. 
Rachel,  Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat  all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave  my boss is gonna kill me!
Joey, Well  what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!
Rachel, I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right  this is what we’re gonna do  we are gonna go to the next highest bidder  and we are just gonna let them buy it  and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.
Joey, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, Look  I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
Rachel, Not great.
Monica, And so  we’re hiding in the bathroom.
Monica, So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Chandler, I got a good one  I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Monica, Ohh.
Chandler, What?!
Ross, Oh my God  you guys!! 
Chandler,  Before you say anything  have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Ross, Who?
Chandler, Richard!
Ross, What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.
Chandler, Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica, I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ross, Yeah  I was but uh  she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Monica, Oh Ross  sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!
Ross, Y’know  maybe she is too young for me. Y’know  when I was over there and she was running around with her friends  I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.
Monica, Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first  weighing stuff.
Ross, Okay umm  bad stuff. Well  I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
Monica, If the school finds out you’re fired.
Ross, Hmm.
Monica, She’s leaving for three months.
Chandler, For camp!
Ross, Okay  good stuff. Umm  well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…
Monica," Look Ross  the only question you need to ask is  ""Do you see a future?"" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her  didn’t you?!"
Ross, No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay  honestly no. I don’t  I don’t see a big future with her.
Monica, Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
Ross, I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh  I hate this part.
Chandler, Hey  you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Joey, Rach! Rachel! Okay  the next highest bidder is at table one.
Rachel, Oh great!
Joey,  Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Phoebe, Oh  okay.
Rachel,  Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Phoebe, It’s a trip for two!  Excuse me.  Excuse me  is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Phoebe, Oh  en chante. 
Joey, Uhh  excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
Joey, Ahh  yes. 
Rachel, Oh well  hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont  the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18 000.
Joey, You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.
Rachel,  Okay. Okay. 
Rachel, Ohh…
Joey, Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!
Rachel, Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
Rachel," Pam! Oh God okay  just imagine this  ""The Pam."""
Joey, Aw-awww!
Rachel," Okay  uh-uh imagine this  ""The Mr. Bowmont."""
Joey, Oooooh…
Rachel, Okay look  let me paint you a little picture.  All right  you are settin’ sail up the Hudson! You’ve got the wind in your h——arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh  you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain  and then when you’re old  Cappy.
Joey, No way! It’s mine!!
Rachel,  What?! What?!
Joey, All that stuff you just said? I want that!
Rachel, But Joey you don’t have $20 000!
Joey, Who cares?! I-I’ll make payments  whatever it takes  I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
Joey, Oh my God  you’re back!
Phoebe, Ohh  let me see it! Let me see your hand! 
Monica, Why do you want to see my hand?
Phoebe, I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Joey, Yeah.
Phoebe, Eww! Oh  it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
Monica,  Okay. 
Chandler,  What did you guys just do?!
Phoebe, What happened?
Chandler, Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
Joey, What?! Noooo… 
Chandler, I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know  and-and surprise her  but now you’ve ruined it!
Joey, We didn’t ruin it!
Chandler, Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
Phoebe, Well  a palm reader  a manicurist  a hand doctor…
Joey, Glove salesman!
Phoebe, Good one! Yeah.
Chandler, This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Phoebe, Look  she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure  so just throw her off the track.
Chandler, That’s right  I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Phoebe, Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
Chandler, I can do that  I’ve had 30 years of practice.
Joey, Hey  being you is finally gonna pay off! 
Monica,  I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
Joey, That guy’s still doing that?!
Rachel,  Hey!  Oh my God you’re here  let me see your hand!!
Phoebe, No  you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Ross,  Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross, Elizabeth  thank God! I was just thinking about…
Ross, What?!
Ross, Okay  break-up’s still on!
Chandler, Okay  okay  here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
Joey, Yeah! And also  a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Monica,  Hi guys!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, What are you up too?
Chandler, Oh  just hanging out  talkin’ about uh  websites.  Yeah  we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Joey,  Yeah  Big Brother.
Monica, Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Chandler, Yeah  well… Y’know  it just got me thinking though  why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Monica, Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Chandler, Eh…
Monica, Okay well that’s good to know.
Joey,  The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!! 
Monica, Sure  I love this part! 
Monica, Richard!
Monica, Ohh… Oh  that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?
Monica, Oh  good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Monica, What uh—What did you—What?!
Monica, Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
Monica, Oh God…  Why don’t they put chairs back here?!
Monica, What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
Monica, What were you doing in Africa?
Monica, Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look  I-I… I’m sorry but umm  this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
Monica, Well he is! Yeah  I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness  in fact  I’m the one that’s making him wait!
Monica, Yeah!
Monica, Why? Because of the government.
Rachel, Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler  gettin’ married.
Phoebe, I know  they’re gonna be so happy together.
Rachel, Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love  how often does that happen?
Phoebe, Not that often!
Rachel, No! I’m so happy for them!
Phoebe, Me too! So happy for them!
Rachel, I’m so happy and not at all jealous.
Phoebe, Oh no! No God  definitely not jealous!
Rachel, I mean I’m probably 98% happy  maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.
Phoebe, Totally. I’m like 90/10.
Rachel, Yeah me too.
Joey, Hey uh  have you guys scene Chandler?
Rachel,  Wh—no  but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya  Tennille.
Monica, So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday  you don’t really believe that do you?
Chandler, Sure I do. In fact  I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime  and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
Monica, Yeah  but that’s pigs not people!
Chandler, If marriage worked  I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Monica, Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
Chandler, Well  never say never but y’know probably uh yeah  never.
Monica, Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
Chandler, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
Monica, Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
Chandler,  It’s okay  I got a plan.
Rachel, We’re gonna find love!
Phoebe, Definitely!
Rachel, Yeah  I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Phoebe, What do you mean?
Rachel, Well y’know  some people make deals with a friend  like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40  they marry each other.
Phoebe, You mean a backup?
Rachel, Exactly!
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah I got that.
Rachel, You do?
Phoebe, Hm-mmm.
Rachel, Who?
Phoebe, Joey.
Rachel, Joey?!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, Are you serious?!
Phoebe, Yeah  I locked him years ago!
Rachel, Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40  you’re gonna marry Joey.
Phoebe, Yep  we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Rachel, Oh  seriously?
Phoebe, Ohh  yeah. I think his exact words were… 
Rachel, Charming.
Phoebe, Well hey  it’s just a backup.
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, Hey Monica!
Monica, Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
Joey, This is for my boat  pretty cool huh?
Monica, Yeah  it’s great.
Joey, Whoa-whoa  what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!
Monica, I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!
Joey, Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Monica, It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere  that I’m not just wasting my time!
Joey, Well  you know Chandler.
Monica, No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
Joey, Maybe you changed?
Monica, I didn’t change!
Joey, Maybe that’s the problem.
Monica, What?!
Joey, Chandler is a complex fellow  one who is unlikely to take a wife.
Monica, Is that some kind of boat talk?
Joey, I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
Monica, What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?
Joey, Monica face it  Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Monica,  Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
Joey, There are?
Monica, Yeah! Richard!
Joey, R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!
Monica, That’s right.
Joey, Chandler loves marriage!!
Monica, You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
Joey, You got that from what I said?!
Ross, What happened you guys?
Ross, Rach!
Rachel, Hey you!
Ross, Hey  come on in.
Rachel, Oh thank you. Hey y’know  I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
Ross, Oh  thanks. Yeah  I really thought we’d be able to make it work  but uh  I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
Rachel, Yeah  love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
Ross, I guess so.
Rachel," So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40  we get married. I mean  we know each other  we like each other  and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like  ""What’s that?!"""
Ross, Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
Rachel, Exactly.
Ross, Ohh  yeah I already have one.
Rachel, What? Who?
Ross, Phoebe.
Rachel, Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just  she said that Joey was her backup.
Ross, Ohh  I don’t think so.
Rachel, Ross! I just had a conversation with her  and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
Ross, That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it  although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Joey, Where the hell have you been?!
Chandler, I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Joey, Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Yeah! Yeah  I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!
Chandler, My—Oh my God!
Joey, I know! They suck!!
Chandler, He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
Joey, I know!
Chandler, Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!
Joey, Look  Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
Chandler, You’re right.
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Okay.  I’m gonna get the ring! I’m gonna get the ring!  I’m gonna go find her and  I’m just going to propose!
Joey, Okay.
Chandler, Okay great.
Joey, Dude-dude-dude!
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Let me know about that coconut phone  it might great for the boat.
Monica, Hi.
Monica, I don’t know why I’m here.
Monica, I don’t know.
Monica,  Chandler is such an idiot!
Monica, Yeah  I’ll have a scotch…
Monica,  Still smoking cigars?
Monica, No that’s  that’s okay.
Monica, Uh yeah  I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
Monica, Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.
Monica, Edward Nevski?
Monica, No.
Monica, But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
Rachel, Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
Phoebe, Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look  I’ve already lost Chandler!
Rachel, What?!
Joey,  Hey!
Ross,  Hey!
Joey, Phoebe! We’re both  your backup?!
Ross, Phoebe  how could you do this to me?!
Phoebe, I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
Joey, No we weren’t!
Ross, I was not!
Phoebe, Okay  this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
Rachel, Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!
Joey, Pick me!!
Ross, No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
Phoebe, All right well let’s see  Ross is a good father  but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
Joey, This is crazy! Hey look  I wanna switch to Rachel!
Ross, Ooh  I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Phoebe, No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions  okay? Just remember my promise  when we get married  three times a week.
Rachel, Oh God  Phoebe!
Phoebe,  I’m talking about massages.
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, Okay  y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here  this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
Joey, Okay that’s fair.
Ross, All right.
Phoebe, Good!
Rachel, Pick one.
Phoebe, Left!  Thank you.
Rachel, You’re welcome.
Phoebe,  Ross!
Rachel,  Joey!  We should just switch.
Phoebe, Yeah absolutely! 
Joey, Yeah.
Monica,  I missed you-you ugly  flat faced old freak!
Monica, Oh!  Him.
Monica, I missed this apartment! Now  this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know  I-I should be with a grown-up  do you know what I mean?!
Monica, Y’know  let’s face it  I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me  I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch  I don’t want that!
Monica, Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me  nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
Monica, Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…
Monica, Y’know  I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know  some stuff before I can…
Chandler, Where is she? I’m not scared of you! 
Chandler,  Scotch on the rocks  with a twist  on a coaster? Ha-ha  Monica! Monica!
Chandler, Well where did she go?
Chandler, Oh my God  I can’t believe this! Y’know  I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
Chandler, Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Chandler, Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Chandler, And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Chandler, But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan  y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things  she’d be surprised!
Chandler, It was working until you showed up  you big tree! I mean  this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight.
Chandler, Yeah I even  got a ring.  Did you get a ring?
Chandler, Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
Joey, Dude!
Chandler, I can’t talk to you now  I gotta find Monica!
Joey, She’s gone.
Chandler, What?
Joey, She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.
Chandler, What are you talking about?
Joey, She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things  and that and that she needed time to think.
Chandler, Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
Joey, I-I did! I told her everything  Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.
Chandler, Well where… Where did she go?
Joey, To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.
Chandler, I can’t believe I ruined this.
Joey, I am so sorry man.
Monica, You wanted it to be a surprise.
Chandler, Oh my God.
Monica, Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
Chandler, Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God  I thought…  Wait a minute  I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you   you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me  I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica  will you marry me?
Monica, Yes.
Monica, I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Joey,  Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Monica, Come in! Come in!  We’re engaged!!!
Rachel, Ohhh  this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
Phoebe, Oh no wait no  this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
Monica, Oh…
Rachel, Oh hell  he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Hey  what’s going on?
Chandler, Hey.
Ross," I found a note on my door  ""Come to Monica’s quick  bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."""
Joey,  Yeah I’ll take that.
Ross, What’s up?
Chandler, Monica and I are engaged.
Ross, Oh my God.  Congratulations.
Chandler, Thanks.
Ross, Where is she?
Monica,  I’m engaged!!!!!! I’m engaged!!!!
Joey, Yeah  she’s been out there for twenty minutes  I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.
Ross," Oh  I thought it was just a kid yelling  ""I’m gay! I’m gay!"" Can I bring her in?"
Phoebe, Oh no  let her stay out there. It’s sweet.
Monica, I’m getting married!!!! I’m gonna be a bride!!!!  No  I will not shut up because I’m engaged!  Ohh  big talk! Huh  why don’t you come over here and say that to me?! Huh  buddy?! Yeah  my fiancee will kick your ass!  Come on  apartment 20! Apartment 20!
Chandler,  Okay  you get her in here.  You bolt the door. I’ll be in the closet.
Monica, Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Okay  umm  I just wanna say that…I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night.  Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night  if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!
Chandler, It’s okay  I want this to be your night too.  To Monica.
Monica, Awww  come on—wait—stop it. Okay  to Monica.
Chandler, To Monica!
Phoebe, So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because  y’know  I’m kinda musical.
Rachel, Yeah Pheebs  honey  she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…
Phoebe, Well speaking of chiming in  remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Rachel,  Yeah  you’re on your own.
Monica, Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
Joey, But I-I-I can’t stay too long  I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.  What?
Chandler," So when you said  ""Get up early "" did you mean 1986?"
Joey, You guys don’t think I look 19?
Phoebe, Oh  19! We thought you said 90!
Monica, Okay everybody  let’s go! Let’s go!
Rachel, Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Joey,  Hey  is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Phoebe, Oh honey no  you ate it all.
Joey, I was afraid of that.
Monica,  Y’know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes!  You’re not getting dressed. 
Chandler, Know what I mean?
Monica, Yeah  but I don’t think we have time.
Chandler, There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Monica,  Let’s do it! 
Monica,  Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired  you had a lot of champagne  don’t worry about it!
Chandler,  I’m not worried  I’m uh  I’m fascinated. Y’know it’s like uh  Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh  I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. 
Phoebe, Check it out. Okay  I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. 
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, If you would’ve let me finish  it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
Chandler, Sure  you guys don’t have this problem  you’re made of wood.  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Chandler, You look great!
Rachel,  Oh  thanks.
Chandler, You okay over there?
Rachel, I don’t know  y’know? I feel a little umm… No  y’know what? Nevermind  I’m gonna be fine.
Chandler, Oh  don’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired  you had a lot of champagne  it happens to everybody.
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Wow! Happy Monica’s night!
Rachel, Well thank you  you too.
Ross, Thanks.
Rachel, Hey  do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Ross, Well sure. But I get married all the time so…
Rachel, Ohh…
Ross, You okay?
Rachel, Yeah  I guess. I-I… I mean  do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
Ross, You mean  we—you and me?
Rachel, Oh no-no-no-no-no  no  no! We  you with someone and me with someone.
Ross, Oh good  you scared me for a minute.
Rachel, Shake it off.
Ross, I mean—no  it’s just ‘cause  it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No  but there was some good times.
Rachel, No  absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
Ross, Surely you can think of something good.
Rachel, Yeah  just give me a minute!  Oh well  yes  I can think of one good thing.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Well you uh  you were always really good at the uh  at the uh the stuff.
Ross, Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
Rachel, Uh-hmm  uh-hmm  yeah  yeah  I really liked your hands.
Ross, My hands?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Ross,  Way to go guys. Y’know  you-you were really good at the stuff too.
Rachel, Oh  I know. Hey  y’know what we never did?  Oh no  not that.  We uh  we never had bonus night!
Ross, A what?
Rachel, Y’know  bonus night. Y’know  when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
Ross, One night  just-just sex. No strings attached?
Rachel, Yeah-yeah  we never had that 
Ross, No.
Ross, Okay  this is getting a little crazy. I mean  I’m-I’m sure it would be amazing but I…gotta say I really-really don’t think it would be a good idea. Y’know? I really  really…don’t.
Joey, ‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?
Chandler,  Take whatever you want  just please don’t hurt me.
Joey, So you’re playing a little Playstation  huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation  ‘sup?! Huh? Come on  am I 19 or what?!
Chandler, Yes  on a scale from 1 to 10  10 being the dumbest a person can look  you are definitely 19.
Joey, Come on man  really how old?!
Chandler, Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please  oh please  keep my underwear!
Joey, Wow thanks! 
Chandler, Joe?
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, Uhh  you’ve had a lot of sex right?
Joey, When? Today? Some  not a lot.
Chandler, Well  it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh  uh  I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too  but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm  there-there was an incident.
Joey, Don’t worry about that man  that happens.
Chandler, It’s happened to you?
Joey, Yeah! Once.
Chandler, Well  what’d you do?
Joey, I did it anyway.
Monica, Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go!  Come on!  Why aren’t you dressed yet?!
Phoebe, I’m sorry  but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. 
Monica,  No  Phoebe  I’ll tell you what  if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.
Phoebe, Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon  if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Monica, Fair enough  now go get ready!
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica, I’ll get everybody else   finally we can start celebrating my— I’m sorry  uh apparently I’ve opened the door to the past.
Ross, Okay  Monica. Mon  uh what-what you just saw…
Monica,  Can I ask you just a little question  huh? Why tonight?
Rachel, What?
Monica, See  I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged  and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So  uh y’know  maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it  but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Rachel, Oh honey  but it is just about…
Ross, It is! It is!
Monica, No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!
Rachel, What?!
Monica, See yeah umm  you kinda stole my thunder!
Ross, Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
Rachel, Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Ross, Yeah!
Monica, That’s true.
Rachel, Honey I swear it we just kissed.
Ross, It was just a kiss. 
Phoebe, You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you  are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Monica, Thunder being stolen!!
Rachel, Okay come on Phoebe  it’s nothing! Monica  come on!
Ross, Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!
Joey, Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Chandler,  I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!
Phoebe, What a great night  Chandler can’t do it  these guys kissed… 
Joey, What?
Chandler, What?!
Joey, You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!
Rachel, No!
Ross, Oh no!
Rachel, No-no  it’s really not huge.
Ross, And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!
Monica, Well  we’re still talking about it  aren’t we?
Phoebe, Well yeah  that and Chandler’s problem.
Joey, Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica  listen-listen  listen  listen  would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
Monica, Yes that would be lovely.
Joey, You got it. Okay. Now  I can pass for 19 right?!
Chandler, Yes  you can pass for 19.
Joey, Really?
Chandler, Yes!
Joey, Seriously?
Chandler, Seriously? Seriously  no! You can play your own age which is 31!
Joey,  I’m 30!
Rachel, Joey  you are not! You’re 31.
Joey,  Aww crap!
Phoebe, Okay  so The Plaza! Okay  we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s   maybe no more for you though.
Monica, Y’know what? I-I think that umm  I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.
Phoebe, Why?!
Rachel, Honey  Monica  this is ridiculous! Look…
Monica, No-no  I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t!  Especially with you. 
Joey, Psss  that is whack!
Phoebe,  Yeah?  Okay  I think I’ll play it at the wedding.
Joey," Yeah! Well  I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like  ""You look 19 "" and then they just take it away like-like  ""No you don’t."""
Phoebe, Well  I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.
Joey, Wouldn’t she?
Phoebe, Would she?
Joey, Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
Ross, Guess who? 
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Hey  I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…
Rachel, What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk  especially with me? I mean  why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Ross, Still thinking about it huh?
Rachel, Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously  what did she mean by that?  Especially you!
Ross,  Oh  who cares?
Rachel, I care!
Ross,  And so do I.
Rachel, Y’know what  I-I have to go talk to her  would you let me just get changed?
Ross, Okay. Sure. 
Rachel, Am I going to let you watch me undress?
Ross,  No! 
Monica, I can’t believe her  y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.
Chandler, Now Monica  I know you’re upset  but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding  you are going to throw the bouquet  and then there’s going to be a honeymoon  maybe in Paris.
Monica, Paris?
Chandler, We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Monica, Keep talking.
Chandler, Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic  but because I can!
Monica, I love you!
Monica,  Bonjour  monsieur.
Chandler, Okay  don’t say anything  you might scare it away.
Chandler, It’s Paris  who knows we’re here!
Monica,  Hi Pheebs  what’s up? 
Phoebe, Okay  you said I could sing at your wedding so  I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
Monica, What?!
Phoebe, Y’know  just some good faith money to hold the date.
Chandler, Pheebs  we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Phoebe, Oh  I see. 
Joey, They break your heart  don’t they?
Phoebe, Y’know  I don’t really their permission.
Joey, Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding  well you sing at their wedding!
Phoebe, Yeah! And if you wanna look 19  then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
Joey, What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.
Phoebe, They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
Joey, And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?
Phoebe, Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Chandler, Oh  give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!
Monica, Yes.
Rachel, Monica  what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone  especially me?
Chandler, What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay  bye-bye!
Rachel, No-no  seriously-seriously  what was the especially me part about?
Monica, Well  let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.
Rachel, What?!
Ross,  Hey  here’s a thought.
Rachel, Monica  what are you talking about?
Monica, My Sweet Sixteen! Remember  you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Chandler,  Ahh  third base.
Monica, It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
Rachel, Monica  y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Monica,  We had a characturist!
Rachel, Oh!!
Phoebe, 
Rachel, Monica  your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Monica, And yet  here we are doing it again.
Rachel, Ugh  Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
Monica, Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ross, Got me. 
Rachel, All right  easy mimey  the moment has passed  it ain’t gonna happen!
Monica, I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Rachel, I swear  I never wanted any part of your night!
Monica, Oh  is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Ross, Uh  Rachel  I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
Chandler,  Why to save your dignity my man.
Rachel,  Monica  why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Monica, I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah  maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Rachel, Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross  let’s go have sex!
Monica,  I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Chandler, Well  somebody should. 
Ross, Look uh  if we’re gonna do this…
Rachel, We’re not gonna do this  all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
Ross, Oh  I see  so everybody wins.
Rachel, Who is it?
Monica,  It’s Monica  open up!
Rachel, Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! 
Ross, Oww!
Rachel, Yeah  you like that baby?  May we help you?
Monica, I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together  but I must warn you  the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
Chandler, How is that ever going to happen?!
Rachel, All right Monica  do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Monica, I know why!
Rachel, No you don’t know why!
Monica, Okay! Why?!
Rachel, Because! Because I was sad.
Monica, What do you mean?
Rachel, Look  I am so…so happy for you guys  but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know  maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb  but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Chandler,  I don’t care  she slept with me.
Rachel, Anyway sweetie  I am  I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
Monica,  I’m sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. 
Ross,  Well  I’m going to take off.  Congratulations man.
Chandler, Thanks.
Ross,  And uh  Rachel.
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, What can I say  you missed your chance. From now on the only person who’s going to enjoy these bad boys  is me. 
Phoebe, 
Chandler,  Hey! Here’s a dollar  consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Phoebe, Oh thank you.
Chandler, Okay. 
Phoebe," Now…  ""Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer——Oh—oh! All right  I’ll pound on him in the morning."
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hi!
Joey, Who wants French toast?
Ross, Oh  I’ll have some!
Joey, Good  me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
Monica,  Oww!
Chandler, What’s the matter honey?
Monica, I don’t know  my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because  I’m engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?
Phoebe, It starts?
Rachel, Yeah  so let’s get started on the wedding plans!
Monica, Okay! 
Chandler,  Already?!
Rachel, Yeah  we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers  the caterers  the music…
Chandler, Oh  I got some thoughts on that.
Rachel, Oh wait Chandler  too many cooks…
Ross, Take from me  as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Monica,  Okay! 
Chandler, What in God’s name is that?!
Ross, Oh my God  the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
Monica, This baby has got everything. Take y’know  locations for instance.  First  organized alphabetically  then geographically  then by square footage.
Phoebe, That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.
Ross, And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at… 
Phoebe, Hey! Ross!
Ross, Phoebe  oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
Phoebe, I need to talk to you  it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
Ross, Oh my God! Of course  of course.  Umm  would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm  do you know each other’s hometowns? Why don’t you…   Wh-what’s going on?
Phoebe, Well  umm  not much. But  I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy  y’know? So  could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Ross, Umm  okay  yeah  sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Phoebe, Nothing—Why?!
Ross, Phoebe  you said it was urgent!
Phoebe, Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Ross, Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Phoebe,  Oh  I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Monica, All right  so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet  but tell me how this is for music.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, All right umm  a string quartet for the procession.
Rachel, Aw.
Monica, A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait  that was from my sixth grade wedding.
Chandler, Well  you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
Joey,  Hey Mon  do you have another pillow?  Y’know  something a little snugglyer?
Chandler, Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Joey, Well  the duck…
Rachel, What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
Joey, Uh  well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
Chandler, Now  do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Monica, Of course you can look at it! Yeah  I want your opinion too!
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
Chandler, Centerpieces!
Monica, Yeah! Roses or Lilies? 
Chandler, Definitely roses.  Well  I just think they’re a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice.
Monica, Oh my God! It’s like one mind.
Chandler, Uh-huh!
Joey,  Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh  I’m gonna get cranky!
Rachel, Joey  there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Joey, Yes it is perfectly good  and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Rachel, What?!
Joey, All right  I’m gonna go! 
Rachel, Now Joey  what did the duck do?!
Joey, I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Joey, Hey little buddy  how are you feeling?  What the hell is in that face cream?  That’s so soft.  Pillowcases!   Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father  the vicar… The vicar?  …wouldn’t be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his… Whoa!  Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book! 
Ross, Uh  Phoebe…
Phoebe, Oh Ross  hi.
Ross, Phoebe  what are you doing?
Phoebe, I’m sorry  I’m with a client right now.
Ross, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Okay  let’s talk outside.
Ross, Phoebe  you can’t massage people in my apartment!
Phoebe, What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
Ross, And they knew about it?
Phoebe,  Okay  well Ross  what is this really about?
Ross, Look  this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Phoebe, Okay  I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
Ross, The big deal is I don’t want naked  greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle—beer! Cold beer.
Rachel, Hey Joey  what ‘cha doing?
Joey, Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
Rachel, No.
Joey, Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Rachel, Joey  did you my face cream?
Joey, Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.
Rachel, Joey   where did you learn that word?
Joey, Where do you think   Zelda?
Rachel,  You found my book?!
Joey, Yeah I did!
Rachel, Joey  what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
Joey, Okay  look I’m sorry  I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have  but you got porn!
Rachel, Hey-hey  y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality  which by the way  you will never understand. 
Joey, You got porn!
Ross, Hello.
Ross, Uh no-no  she-she’s out for the night.
Ross, Can I  can I help you with something?
Ross,  Yes I am.
Chandler, Oh yeah  I should probably call them.
Chandler, Oh  I don’t think I ever heard that story.
Monica, Oh dad  really you don’t need to…
Chandler, What a sweet story.
Monica, Well  at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
Monica, Anyway  we’re really excited about our wedding plans  and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?
Monica, What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
Monica, I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
Monica, You bought the beach house when I was 23!
Monica, What about when I started dating Chandler?
Chandler, Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. 
Monica, I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
Ross, Okay! Now  I’m going to touch you.  Ohh  that’s soft. 
Monica, I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
Chandler, I don’t know  my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
Rachel, Well what happened at dinner?
Monica, My parents spent the money for our wedding!
Phoebe,  My God! What did you order?!
Rachel, Wait  but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a  rec. center!
Chandler, Honey  it’s gonna be okay.
Monica, No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
Rachel, No  y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need  you don’t need this custom-made  empire waisted  duchess  satin gown; you can wear off the rack. 
Chandler, Look  it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.
Rachel, Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
Phoebe, Look  why don’t you just pay for it yourself?
Monica, How? I don’t have any money.
Chandler, Well  I have some.
Monica, How much?
Chandler, Well  close to… 
Monica, Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
Rachel, Well what?! How-how much is it?!
Monica, It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.
Rachel, Ohh!  Really?!
Monica,  How great are you  you little saver?! I mean  the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
Rachel,  Ohh  you guys are so made for each other.
Chandler, Well  you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Chandler, Well  come on  I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future  not just for a party.
Phoebe,  Wow!  Hello  Mr. Chandler.
Monica, This is the most special day of our lives.
Chandler, No  I realize that honey  but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Monica, Honey  umm I-I love you   but umm  if you call our wedding a party one more time  you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen  we could always earn more money  okay? But uh  we’re only gonna get married once.
Chandler, Look  I understand  but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
Monica, You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?
Chandler, Yes  I am!
Phoebe, Wow  money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Joey, Hey Rach.
Rachel,  Joey.
Joey, Hey Rach  do you smell smoke?
Rachel, Uh-huh  I get it  smoke  chimney  chimney sweep  very funny  ha-ha.
Joey, No-no-no  I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.
Rachel, Well no  I don’t smell anything.
Joey, Oh  y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.
Ross,  Hey  what are you guys  what are you guys talking about?
Rachel, Nothing!
Ross,  Damn  this coffee’s cold! Hey Rach  do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? 
Rachel, Y’know  I can not believe you told him  Joey!
Ross, So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Rachel, Uh-huh  yeah I did  because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. 
Ross,  Oh yeah  yeah? Well uh  when we were going out  I read tons of porno magazines!   ‘Sup?
Phoebe,  Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Ross,  Excuse me ladies.  I’m sorry?
Phoebe, My massage client  Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Ross,  I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Phoebe, He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Ross, Okay  so it wasn’t uh  a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And  and I gently exfoliated him with  with a mop.
Phoebe, Well  he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Ross, Hey  y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
Phoebe, Oh  it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Ross, He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right  you’re right. I’m sorry.
Joey, Dude  what are you massaging an old man for?
Ross, His daughter was hot.
Joey, Gotcha.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Listen umm  I’ve been thinking  it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean  you work  you work really hard for that.
Chandler, Ehh.
Monica, Eh  you work for that.
Chandler, Look  I thought about it too  and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica, You do?!
Chandler, Yeah  I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look  when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then  then that’s what we’re gonna do.
Monica, Oh  you’re so sweet.  Oh  but wait  what about our  what about the future and stuff?
Chandler, Eh  forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids  y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica, You thought about that?
Chandler, Yeah.
Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler, Uh  four  a boy  twin girls and another boy.
Monica, What else did you think about?
Chandler, Well  stuff like where’d we live  y’know? Like a small place outside the city  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know  we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course  we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Monica,  Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big  fancy wedding.
Chandler, Sure you do.
Monica, No  I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler, You sure?
Monica, Uh-hmm.
Chandler, I love you so much.
Monica, I love you.  Hey listen umm  when  when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat  but you meant dog right.
Chandler, Oh yeah  totally!
Monica, Oh good.
Joey, Hello  Zelda.
Rachel, Who are you supposed to be?
Joey, The vicar!
Rachel, Do you even know what a vicar is?
Joey, Like a goalie  right?
Rachel,  Yeah. Look Joey  it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!
Joey, All right  I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by  taking you roughly in the barn. 
Rachel, All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
Joey, Huh?
Rachel,  That’s right  I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it  but you just said all the right things.
Joey,  I-I-I-I did? 
Rachel,  Yeah! Ohh  I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
Joey, This body? 
Rachel, Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Joey, Hey-hey  you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.
Rachel, Oh  come on now  don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But  I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride! 
Joey, I don’t want to  I’m scared.
Chandler, Hey  you guys!
Chandler, So  what do you think?
Ross, About what?
Rachel, Yeah  what?
Joey, What?
Chandler, Are you kidding? Okay  I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint. 
Joey, Eyes! No  no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!
Chandler, I got glasses!
Ross, Well  you-you’ve always had glasses.
Chandler, No I didn’t!
Ross, Are you sure?
Rachel, Yeah-yeah  did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round  burgundy  and they made you look kind of umm…
Joey, Feminine.
Rachel, Yes!
Chandler, No!
Monica, Sweetie  I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, Yeah!
Chandler,  You didn’t think I used to wear glasses  right?
Monica, Of course! 
Phoebe, So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Chandler, That’s okay Pheebs  we’re not having a party or anything  so you don’t have to get us…
Monica,  If someone wants to give us a present  we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.
Rachel, Oh  y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh  portable CD players.
Monica, Oh  I already have one.
Phoebe, Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Rachel, Yeah  and-and-and by someone  she means Joey.
Monica, Hey  I know I what I want!
Chandler, What we want honey.
Monica, No  you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.
Phoebe, You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Monica, Uh-huh  yeah.
Phoebe, You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?
Chandler, Dying people say the craziest things.
Monica, I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Phoebe, Break my heart—Oh  all right.
Monica, Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.
Chandler, Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
Joey,  Ahoy!
Chandler, Hey! How’s the boat?!
Joey, Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Monica, Oh  so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Joey, Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
Phoebe, If you don’t sail your boat  what do you do on it?
Joey, Oh  it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda  sit  hang around  drink a few beers  eat some chips. 
Chandler, Well  it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
Rachel, Y’know Joey  I could teach you to sail if you want.
Joey, You could?
Rachel, Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Phoebe, Your own boat?
Rachel, What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Chandler, Do you know what I was thinkin’?
Monica, What?
Chandler, Nothing  I just like to go like this. 
Ross,  Hey Chandler  what are you doing tonight?
Chandler, Uh why  do you have a lecture?
Ross, No  why?
Chandler, Then free as a bird. What’s up?
Ross, My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Monica, Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you  he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.
Ross, Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you  he asked for Chancy  I assumed he meant you.
Chandler, Well  did-did you correct him?
Ross, No  I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Monica, This is so cool  maybe this is something you can do every week.
Ross, Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Monica, Oh  just so you know  you-you have to let him win.
Ross, Yeah.
Monica, He hates to lose.
Chandler, Oh no problem  maybe I’ll play with my left hand.
Ross, You’re not a lefty?
Chandler, Does anybody know me?!
Monica, What’s wrong Phoebe?
Phoebe, I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Monica, No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Phoebe,  Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me  and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Ross, Oh  we have to get you an engagement present?
Chandler, Don’t worry about it Pheebs.
Ross, No one got me an engagement present.
Phoebe, Okay  here I wish you health and happiness. 
Chandler, An old cookie?
Monica,  This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!
Phoebe, See no-no  I made a batch and I froze it  and this is the only one left.
Chandler, We can’t accept this.
Phoebe, Why not?
Chandler, ‘Cause it’s gross.
Monica, No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Phoebe, Really?!
Monica, Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Chandler, Okay  we owe you a present.
Ross, Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
Joey,  Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
Rachel, That is the Coast Guard.
Joey, What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. 
Rachel, Joey  just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
Joey, All right.
Rachel, Okay  I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time  are you ready?
Joey, Come on Rach  not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing  and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!
Rachel, Oh  okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old  hot chickas? Okay  let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though   what’s this called?
Joey, Uh  boat rope.
Rachel, Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Joey, Uhh  rub it?
Rachel, No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
Joey, I’d say  come again. No-no  wait I-I-I know this one  I know this one  uh…
Rachel, Time’s up  now your dead.
Joey, And deaf!
Rachel, Okay  you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes  but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! 
Joey, Yes.
Rachel, Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game  Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay  so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
Joey, I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
Monica, All right  I definitely taste nutmeg.
Phoebe, You do?
Monica, You don’t?  Well  that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.
Phoebe, That and arrogance.
Joey,  Hey.
Monica, Hey! How was sailing?
Joey, I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know  you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie. 
Joey,  Women are mean!!! 
Phoebe, I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Ross,  Hey.
Monica, Hey! How was it?
Ross, Well I had a great time! Umm  Chancy on the other hand…
Chandler, I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Ross, And what did he ask you not to call him?
Chandler, Daddy. All right look  here’s the story.  Well  we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.
Chandler, Guys?
Ross, Over here. 
Monica, Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!
Chandler, I know.
Monica, You gave my father a lap dance!
Chandler, Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Ross, ‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
Chandler, Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Phoebe, Come on  it’s not that big a deal!
Chandler, Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
Ross, Now  I know you wanted to bond with my dad  but did you really have to bond to that part?
Monica, Listen  I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!
Chandler, I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
Ross, Oh  but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
Monica, I wasn’t escaping.
Ross, Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
Monica, I was trying to help out a squirrel.
Ross, You were trying to eat it!
Chandler, If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
Monica,  Come on.  Hello?  I’m sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay  I’ll call you later dad. I love you. 
Chandler,  All right  I’m off to see your dad.
Ross, Whoa-whoa  aren’t you a little over dressed?
Rachel,  Yeah  and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Chandler, Look  I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore  and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face  I don’t mean my ass. 
Ross,  Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Rachel, I don’t know. Y’know  they didn’t get us anything.
Ross, Thank you!
Joey,  Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Well hello! So  when are we gettin’ back out on the water matey?
Joey, Oh uh  I don’t know the boat way to say this  but uh never!
Rachel, Why not?
Joey, Because! You’re mean on the boat!
Rachel, What? I was just trying to teach you.
Joey, Well  lesson learned! Rachel is mean!
Ross, Yeeeeeep… Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dad’s boat she wouldn’t let me help at all.
Rachel, Excuse me  I wanted you to help  but you couldn’t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.
Ross, You have to respect the sea! 
Rachel, Look Joey  I’m sorry if-if you thought that was mean  but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay  my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat  I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.
Joey," Does a good teacher say  ""Put down the beer pinhead!?"""
Rachel, Well  does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?
Joey, Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
Rachel, Yeah  I didn’t want you to get hit by the boom!
Joey, Well it hit me anyway! And it would’ve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
Rachel, All right  y’know what? I-I’m sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.
Joey, You won’t boss me around anymore?
Rachel, I won’t boss you around.
Joey, And you’ll be nice?
Rachel, And  I’ll be nice.
Joey, And you’ll be topless?
Rachel, And—Joey!
Joey, Do you want me to learn?!
Monica, Okay  here’s batch 22. Ohh  maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel  but no nutmeg.
Ross, Let’s give it a shot.
Monica, Okay. Man  I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.
Phoebe, Oh  what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Monica, No  just a Friday night.
Ross, Ohh  these are pretty good.
Phoebe, Yeah  but not as good as batch 17.
Ross, Which one was that?
Monica, The ones we had right after you almost threw up.
Ross, Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.
Phoebe, Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.
Ross, Yeah  ooh yeah  I think there is one from batch 17 left  uh…  It’s batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! 
Rachel, Okay Joey honey  you’re doing really good! All right  now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?
Joey, Ohh yeah.
Rachel, Right?
Joey, Nope.
Rachel, It’s left sweetie  but that’s okay sweetie  that’s a tough one.
Joey, I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
Rachel, Okay  go to the left.  The left!
Joey, Huh?
Rachel,  Just sit over there!! 
Joey,  Okay! Okay  you’re yelling again! See that?
Rachel, No! No-no  no-no-no  very quiet  said with love  no yelling.
Joey, Oh  y’know what? Since I’m here  I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. 
Rachel, Okay Joey  we’re luffing a little bit  so could you tighten up the cunningham? 
Joey, Uh  wow  you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.
Rachel, Joey  come on! We just went over this! 
Joey, Oh  y’know  when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
Rachel,  No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not  because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!
Joey, All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!
Rachel, What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!
Joey, Why not?!
Rachel, Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!
Joey, Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Rachel, Oh my God  wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I?   Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!
Joey, Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
Rachel, No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you  I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey  ohh I’m my father. Oh my God  this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh  Joey  I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Joey, Well  hey I did learn.
Rachel, Really?
Joey, Yeah! Come on.
Rachel, Awww…
Joey, Yeah  it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know  I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Rachel, Left.
Joey, Damnit!
Phoebe, Y’know  I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.
Ross, Looking up?
Phoebe, Oh yeah—No  she was really nice to me  but she’s in hell for sure.
Monica, Well  I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Ross, Aww  Pheeb  come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about  what about your sister?
Phoebe, Oh no-no  no  I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th  2032.
Ross, That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit  I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
Phoebe, That’s what you think.
Monica, Well  I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
Phoebe, Well  y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother  Nesele Tolouse.
Monica, What was her name?
Phoebe, Nesele Toulouse.
Monica, Nestle Tollhouse?!
Phoebe, Oh  you Americans always butcher the French language.
Monica,  Phoebe  is this the recipe? 
Phoebe,  Yes!!  Ohh.
Monica, I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
Phoebe, I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  you’re burning in hell!!
Chandler, So you understand  I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know  I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.
Chandler, What did you do when they found out?
Chandler, So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
Rachel, Well Joey  I hate to admit it  your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Joey, Yeah  yeah. Hey  why don’t you give a pull on that rope? 
Rachel, Ohh we’re not sailing.
Joey, Just pull on it.
Rachel, All right.  Hey-hey-hey!!  Sandwiches!
Joey, What else?
Rachel,  Here you go.
Joey, Thank you.
Rachel, Oh wow! 
Joey, What are you doing?
Rachel, Ohh  sorry.
Joey, What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.
Rachel, Ohh whoops.
Joey, Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I’m my dad!
Joey,  So  what did you guys think?
Monica,  Hello?  Hold on please. Joey  it’s your mom. 
Chandler, It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
Ross, Ohhhh…
Rachel, That’s nice.
Joey,  Mom  so what did you think? 
Rachel, Well that was umm…Okay.
Ross, It wasn’t the best.
Chandler, That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Monica, Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Ross, Well  the lighting was okay.
Rachel, Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time  lighting is mine!
Monica, And I have costumes.
Ross," Oh great! That means I’m stuck with  ""So  we were watching you in there  and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!"""
Rachel, What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Phoebe, I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Chandler, And say nothing?
Phoebe, Uh-huh  yeah that’s right.
Joey,  Wow! Well  my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think?  It wasn’t that good.
Monica, Phoebe  do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
Phoebe, What? You mean behind my back?
Rachel,  Oh! Hi you guys  oh my God! You’ll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and…
Joey,  You guys! You guys! You’re not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Rachel, Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Joey, Ooh  sorry. Sorry. You finish  go.
Rachel, Okay  so anyway I’m sittin’ in my office and guess who walks in.
Joey, I’m gonna be on two TV shows!
Rachel, Joey!
Joey, Oh  you weren’t finished?
Rachel, Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story.  It was Ralph Lauren!  Ralph Lauren walked into my office!
Joey, Uh Rach  if you’re gonna start another story  at least let me finish mine.
Rachel, It’s the same story.
Joey,  Wow  it’s really long.
Rachel,  Anyway  Ralph just came in to tell me that he’s so happy with my work that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for polo retail.
Monica, Still get a discount on wedding dresses?
Rachel, Yeah!
Monica, I’m so happy for you!
Joey, Well  these really are the days of our lives.
Monica, What?!
Joey, Well  since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Phoebe,  Oh God!
Rachel, I got—I get a big pay raise!
Phoebe, Oh hey!
Joey, I’ll be playing Drake Remoray’s twin brother  Stryker!
Monica, Oooh!
Rachel, I get to hire my own assistant!
Joey,  Well—I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
Rachel,  And you were at this job for four years?
Rachel, Okay  well this is all very impressive Hilda  um I just have one last question for you. Uh  how did I do? Was this okay?
Rachel, I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid  we did have a maid  but this is-this isn’t the same thing.
Rachel, No. Yeah  and I know that. All right  well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.
Rachel, All right.  I’m a total pro!
Rachel,  Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes  uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.
Rachel, Really?!  Okay well then  all right  well just have a seat there. Umm  so what’s—what is—what’s your name?
Rachel, Uh-huh  go on.
Rachel, That’s your whole name  okay of course it is! Okay  well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here. 
Rachel, Oh come on  what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s  come on!
Rachel, Okay  hold on just a second.  I’m sorry  it’s for human resources  everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?
Chandler, No-no-no-no.  Hey! 
Phoebe,  Anyway  I should go. Okay  bye.
Monica,  Hey sweetie.
Chandler, Hi sweetie. So  what was with all the whispering?
Monica, I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
Chandler, Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Monica, Awww.  But still no.
Chandler, No I’m serious  we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Monica, Really? Okay  so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Chandler, Oh no-no  I can’t do that.
Monica, If you tell me  I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, So  Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant  I mean a guy  a hibachi  and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway  we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Monica, Oh my God. He threw up?
Chandler, No  he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe’s secret?
Monica, Oh  Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
Chandler, That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Monica, That’s right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.
Rachel, Chandler  you have an assistant right?
Chandler,  Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Rachel, No  I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…
Chandler, What about him?
Rachel, I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Phoebe, Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute  you hire them because they’re qualified.
Rachel, Uh-huh. No  I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?  Look how pretty!
Phoebe, Let’s see.  Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him  because that—it’s not professional. Umm  this is for me  yes? Thanks. 
Rachel, Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!
Chandler, Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Joey, Hey Terry!
Joey, It’s been a while  huh? Wow  it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
Joey, So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Joey, Okay.
Joey,  Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Joey, Well  I was Dr. Drake Remoray  Stryker’s twin brother. I mean  who looks more me than me right?
Joey, Y’know Terry  I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series   with a robot.
Joey, Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya  huh? Well y’know what?  This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Rachel, Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?
Rachel, Kinda.
Rachel, Oh-ohh  thank you.
Rachel, Well…
Rachel, But I hired you!
Rachel, Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!
Rachel, Yeah!
Rachel, Me either. Umm  all right  first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey! Good  you’re home!
Chandler," Oh it’s always nicer to here than  ""Aw crap! You again!"""
Monica, Hey baby. 
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, I made you a surprise.
Chandler, Oh yeah?
Monica, Yeah  tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.
Chandler, Did you not understand the story?
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey! What’s up?
Monica, Ross!
Ross, Oh  nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.
Chandler, Huh.
Ross,  Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that  dinner stuff? You making dinner?
Chandler, No!  Shhh!
Ross, What you got over there? Tacos?
Monica, No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys. 
Ross, Uhh  those are tacos.
Monica, Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
Ross, Eh  either way I’ll pass.  I still can’t eat those.  What’s so funny?!
Monica,  I’m not laughing.
Ross,  You told her!
Chandler, Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! 
Ross,"  Look  okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said  ""Umm  what would make this ride more fun?!"""
Monica, You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah  I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! 
Ross,  How could you tell her?!
Chandler, I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!
Ross, Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Chandler, Du-ude!
Monica,  What happened in Atlantic City?!
Ross, Well  Chandler and I are in a bar…
Chandler," Did you not hear me say  ""Du-ude?!"""
Ross, And this girl is making eyes at Chandler  okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh  after a minute or two  I see them kissing. Now  I know what you’re thinking  Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls  and you’re right  Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
Monica,  You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Chandler, In my defense  it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Ross, Oh Mon  I laughed so hard…
Chandler, Ho-ho  so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Ross, Whatever dude  you kissed a guy.
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey—Ooh  how’s Hilda? Is she working out?
Rachel, Ohh  my new assistant is working out  yes.
Joey, Was she happy you gave her the job?
Rachel, Oh  my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Joey,  Hello?  Oh hey! Can you  can you hang on a second?  It’s the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute?  Hey  funny you should call. I was just looking over next week’s script.  Canceled?!  Like they’re taking it off the air?  Ohh.  All right  see you Monday.  We’re not even shootin’ them anymore?!!  All right  bye!  They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Phoebe, Sorry.
Rachel, I’m sorry Joey.
Joey, Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
Chandler, You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college  Ross used to wear leg warmers!
Ross, All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Chandler, Ross came in forth and cried!
Monica, Oh my God! 
Ross, Oh  is that funny?! Oh  you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Monica, I-I already told him everything!  You shush!!
Ross, Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner  so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
Monica, Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Ross, Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
Monica, It’s hard for some people!
Chandler,  Of course it is.  Wow—whoa!
Monica, Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Chandler, Hey!!!
Monica, Ohh  I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!
Ross, Ohh! Ohh! In college  Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
Chandler, That was you!
Ross, Whatever dude  you kissed a guy.
Joey, How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today  I got nothin’!
Rachel, Well wait a minute  what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Joey, Uh  well they might be a little mad at me over there.
Phoebe, What happened?
Joey, Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
Rachel, Joey  why would you do that?
Joey, Because they wanted me to audition!
Phoebe, You! An actor?! That’s madness!
Rachel, Tag?  Hi  who was that?
Rachel, Really? 
Phoebe, Hi!
Phoebe, You must be Hilda.
Rachel, Yeah  this is Tag. Tag  this is Phoebe. Phoebe  can I see you for a second? 
Phoebe, Oh  you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Rachel,  Okay. We’ll be right back. 
Phoebe, So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Rachel, All right I know  I know how it looks Pheebs  but I’m telling you…
Phoebe, But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Rachel, Yes  I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you  from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional.  Yes?
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Gay? Yeah. 
Joey, Hey! Terry.
Joey, Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look  I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.
Joey, Wait! Terry! Please! Look  I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please  help me out  for old times sake.
Joey,  I’m back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
Monica, Y’know  in my defense  umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
Ross, And in my defense  the cleaning lady came on to me!
Chandler,  You have no trouble telling time now right?
Monica, No!
Chandler, Quick! What time is it?! 
Monica, I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at Pampers? 
Chandler, Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Monica, Yeah?
Chandler, Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
Monica, Ohh  absolutely.
Ross, And! We should keep all the stuff uh  we told each other secret from everybody else.
Monica, Yeah  definitely!
Ross, Okay   if you’ll excuse me  I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
Monica, Then  I’d steer clear of Phoebe.
Ross, Man! 
Chandler, Yeah  and not that you would  but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.
Rachel,  Hi! 
Rachel, Well yeah  sure  what’s up?
Rachel, Oh really?!
Rachel, Oh  did you not want people to know that?
Rachel, Why’s that?
Rachel, Ohh  you can say. Come on  I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things. 
Rachel, ‘Kay.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel,  Yeah  she’s gay.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, What’s the matter?
Chandler, Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Phoebe, Oh Willie’s still alive!
Chandler, What are you guys doing?
Monica, Oh  my mom called  they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper  so we’re looking for a good picture of us.
Chandler, Oooh  I’m afraid that does not exist.
Monica, That’s not true  there are great pictures of us!
Chandler, No  there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this… 
Phoebe, Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.
Chandler, I don’t know what it is  I just can’t take a good picture.
Monica,  Oh  here’s a great one.
Chandler, Yeah  I’m not in that.
Monica, I know  but look at me all tan.
Phoebe, Hey  why don’t you guys go  get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Monica, That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know… 
Phoebe, Yeah that’s great! Next to that  Chandler won’t look so stupid.
Monica, Chandler what do you say?
Chandler, All right  but I should warn you  I’m not going. I’m going. 
Ross,  Dude  that reverse lay-up! Oh…
Chandler, How about those three pointers?
Ross, Amazing!
Chandler, And those guys were this  close to lettin’ us play this time too.
Rachel, Hey look-look  Phoebe’s talking to uh  Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Ross, Oh  you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy  we call him Hums While He Pees.
Chandler, Yes  and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Phoebe,  Hey you guys  Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Rachel, Hey  I thought that guy was married.
Phoebe, He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.
Ross, It’s not a club.
Rachel, Phoebe  if this guy’s going through a divorce  is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Ross, Hey  divorced men are not bad men!
Chandler, They have that on the napkins at the club.
Rachel, Oh  I gotta get back to work.
Phoebe, You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
Rachel, Yeah but  my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Chandler, Rach  if you have a crush on this guy  why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?
Rachel, Oh no  I know that. I know that. Although  we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Ross, Soon he’ll be able to call you  that lady he knew who got fired.
Rachel, I am not gonna get fired  because I’m not gonna act on it.
Phoebe, So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
Rachel, Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!
Ross, Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.
Chandler, Dude that is so sad.
Ross, I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
Chandler, Could I play?
Rachel, Oh  no sit-ups today Tag?
Rachel, Oh  well drop and give me ten more!
Rachel, Uh  I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
Rachel, Oh  great could you make me four copies of those?
Rachel,  Ahh  hi! Hi! Melissa  what’s up? I’m just uh  about to umm  go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y’know  like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What’s up? 
Rachel, No. Why?
Rachel, Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
Rachel, Okay  whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room  okay? But  y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
Rachel, Oh yeah. All right  back to work.
Rachel, Yeah Melissa  I don’t want to be known as the uh  office bitch  but I will call your supervisor.
Chandler, Okay. 
Chandler, No  I am.
Monica, Chandler  listen to me sweetie  I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
Chandler, I do? 
Monica, Yeah!  All right  maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm  try looking sexy.
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, Or not.
Rachel, Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
Joey, Uhh  well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
Rachel, Yeah  sure. Umm…here. 
Joey, Great.  You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?
Rachel, Yeah  I don’t think so Joe.
Joey, All right  I guess this will be fine.
Rachel, Hey  listen umm  what-what are you doing tonight?
Joey, Nothing  why?
Rachel, How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.
Joey, Huh  Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
Rachel, I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!
Joey, Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.
Rachel, Joey  just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.
Joey, Yeah  okay.
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey, Sure  no problem.  Ooh—Hey  donuts!
Rachel, Yeah!
Joey, Okay. 
Monica," I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay  we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.  Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say ""Geller and Bing to be married "" not ""Local woman saves drowning moron!""  Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!"
Chandler, Aww! 
Monica, That’s it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
Ross," I like this one.  It seems to say  ""I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."""
Monica, They can’t all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh  there it is.
Chandler, Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
Monica, Do you really want to pull at that thread?
Phoebe, I’m having a really good time!
Phoebe, Ohh. No that’s okay  he’s a friend.
Phoebe, Yeah  I… Well y’know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals  so I’d just be lost.
Phoebe, Okay  don’t freak out. I’ll go.
Phoebe, Okay  I know. Hold on.  Hey Ross?
Ross, Yeah?
Phoebe, Yeah  umm that’s Whitney   Kyle’s ex-wife out there  now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
Ross, What?! No!
Phoebe, Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. 
Ross, Look  I don’t think so Pheebs.  All right  I’ll do it. But just because you’re a friend. 
Phoebe, Hi Ginger.
Ross, All right! I want my key back!
Phoebe, I don’t have it!
Ross, It’s right there! 
Phoebe, Ugh  okay Sherlock! 
Ross, Look  I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
Phoebe, All right  well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex.
Ross, Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
Phoebe, Okay.
Ross, Hi Whitney.
Ross, Yep.  Okay.
Phoebe,  Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
Ross,  Hi! I’m sorry  but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman  who by the way did not spend the night.
Ross, Okay.   I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
Phoebe, Watching ballroom dancing?
Ross, Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
Phoebe, Well look-look  okay Ross  Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Ross, Like what?
Phoebe, Like she’s really mean  and she’s over critical  and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
Ross, Okay.
Phoebe, And! She uses sex as a weapon!
Ross, Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
Phoebe, You’re still gonna go out with her?!
Ross, Yeah!
Phoebe, Well  didn’t you just hear what I said?!
Ross, Pheebs come on! I mean  consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now  if you’ll excuse me…
Phoebe,  No listen to me! She is crazy!
Phoebe, You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
Rachel, Hi Tag! Hey  so did you have fun with uh  with Joey last night?
Rachel, Ohh that’s nice.
Rachel, Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Rachel,  Oh.
Rachel, That’s great! Wow man  so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey, See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now  pretend I have a camera.  You’re changing it!
Chandler, I can’t help it!
Joey, All right  all right  all right  all right  you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
Chandler, Borrow money from me?
Joey, Okay  first—first of all  you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down   look down  keep looking down; then I look up.  See? All right  now you try. Look down   you’re looking down  keep looking down…
Chandler, Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Joey, I had a donut. 
Rachel,  Hi!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Rachel, So uh  heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Joey, Yeah! That guy’s all right!
Rachel, Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
Joey, What?
Rachel, Y’know  all the women.
Joey, Hey well  you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know  that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.
Chandler,  I’m right here!
Rachel, All right  would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay  just the idea of you and he and all these women  it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me  all right?!
Joey, Hey! No-no-no-no  you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
Chandler, I’m still right here!
Rachel, All right  will you  will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this  dating tons of women thing is!
Joey,  What?!
Rachel, I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him  it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell  I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
Joey, I know  Monica told me.
Chandler, Did you have a crush on me  when you first met me?
Rachel, Yeah. Sure. 
Chandler, Can you people not see me?! 
Rachel,  So  will you talk to him?
Joey, I don’t know Rach.
Rachel, Oh  come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Joey, One!  No ten! You said ten! You can’t take that back!
Joey, I don’t know. You uh  you got something for me?
Joey, Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.
Joey, Yeah  for you!
Monica,  Hey! There you are!
Chandler, There I am!
Monica, Are you okay?
Chandler, Yeah  Joey said I uh  I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
Monica, What?!
Chandler, Yeah  and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Monica, Chandler  what were you thinking?
Chandler, I don’t know  but don’t worry  don’t worry  because I know how to take a picture now.  Okay  see? Look down   look down  look down… 
Monica, Chandler?
Chandler,  Yeah! 
Phoebe, Hi.
Ross, Hi.
Phoebe, So  how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Ross," Listen  you are hearing one side of the story  okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was  ""I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."""
Phoebe, Yeah well  maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
Ross, Well  I don’t think we are gonna have that problem  but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
Phoebe, You think he’s emotionally unavailable?
Ross, I think he can be.
Phoebe, Well  maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!
Ross, Well  excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Phoebe, Yeah well  she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.
Ross,  I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
Phoebe,  We want the last six years back!!
Ross, So do we!! So do we!!  I’m sorry you had to see that.
Rachel, Hi!  Thanks  hey so uh what’d you do last night?
Rachel, Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
Rachel, Wow! I did not see that coming.
Rachel, Oh no  yes I do! I do! I mean  come on go on  you were  you were saying I am happier when uh  y’know?
Rachel, Really?
Rachel, Sp-spoil?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Rachel, Well  I-I’m startin’ too.
Rachel, Yes! Hell yes!
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, I’d love to!
Rachel,  Hello?!  Oh  yeah!  This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.  Yeah!
Ross, My God!
Phoebe, Oh  I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed  how’s Whitney?
Ross, Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
Phoebe, Oh he knows!  For the most part.
Phoebe, Both of you together?
Ross, Wh-what’s up?
Ross, Oh just say it Kyle!
Phoebe, What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Phoebe, Oh right  because you’re so capable of change.
Ross,  Y’know  he hums when he pees!
Ross, It makes him miss the bowl  but whatever.
Ross, That’s all right  we-we don’t need you. In fact  hey I’m over it already.
Phoebe, Yeah  and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
Ross,  I’m sorry. Ugh  Pheebs  you were  you were right about her. Y’know  she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah  I hurt my back a little.
Phoebe, Oh. Y’know  he hums while he does other stuff to.
Ross, Yeah  were better off without them.
Phoebe, And y’know  even if they break up again  you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!
Ross, Divorced men’s club.
Phoebe, Potato  Potaato. 
Monica, Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
Phoebe, Ooh  let’s see it!
Chandler, Ahhh.
Monica, Okay. 
Chandler, Oh yeah  that looks good.
Phoebe, You guys make a very attractive couple. 
Joey, Yeah  we look great together.
Monica, Yeah  we really do!
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!
Joey, Y’know  we don’t have to imagine.
Chandler, I’m marrying her.
Joey, We’ll just see.
Monica, Okay  the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel, Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it’s you!
Phoebe, I hope it’s you.
Rachel, Me too!
Monica, First of all um  I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…
Rachel, Okay  bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Monica, Well umm  I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically  if Phoebe were mine…
Phoebe, Yes!!! Oh!!
Rachel, Hypothetically!
Phoebe, Still.
Monica, If Phoebe were my maid of honor…
Rachel, Uh-hmm.
Monica, Rachel would be Phoebe’s  I would be Rachel’s  that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Rachel, Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
Phoebe, Yeah  I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Monica,  Well that’s the best part. Umm  you guys get to decide!
Phoebe, Wh-why is that the best part?
Monica, Because then I don’t have to!
Rachel, Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now  I would like to make a toast  to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing   my best friend  and truly one of the nicest people that…
Monica, I’m really not deciding!
Rachel, Fine!
Monica, Yeah that’s right.
Phoebe, Aww  and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
Chandler, Die Hard still great!
Joey, Yep. Hey  what do you say we make it a double feature?
Chandler, What’d you rent?
Joey, Die Hard 2.
Chandler,  Joey  this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey, Oh  well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Ross, Joey  we just saw it!
Joey, And?
Ross, And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Ross, Dude  you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Chandler, Yeah  I just got uh  got plans.
Ross, Well  John McLane had plans!
Chandler, No  see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Joey, What are you talking about? Bitch.
Phoebe, Hey Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Umm  when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel, Really?!
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Rachel, Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
Phoebe, Oh! Well  if that’s what you want…
Rachel, Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
Phoebe, But why does it even matter?!
Rachel, Why does it matter so much to you?!
Phoebe, Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
Rachel, What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
Phoebe,  You wouldn’t! Okay look  Rachel I know you really want to do this  but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!
Rachel, Yeah but Phoebe…
Phoebe, And no  oh please  oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.
Rachel, Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
Phoebe, Oh  thank you so much!  Okay.
Rachel, I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
Phoebe, Oh I know.
Rachel, Better than Chandler. 
Ross, What happened?!!
Joey, Well  I don’t know!!
Ross, We fell asleep! That is all.
Joey, Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right  well uh  I’d better go.
Ross, I think that would be best.
Joey, Yeah. All right  I’ll talk to you later.
Ross, Okay. But not about this!
Joey, No! Never! Never!  Bye.
Ross, No touch! No touch!
Monica, Yeah hey  a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.
Chandler, That’s sweet.
Monica, No  it’s more like a  good luck.
Chandler, So uh  what did this woman look like?
Monica, She was like 30  dark hair  attractive.
Chandler, Well  is there any chance you were looking into a bright  shiny thing called a mirror?
Monica, Come on  was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Chandler, No  no I only dated two girls in college  both blonde  both not attractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Well  let’s see…  Okay uh  is that her? 
Monica, Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Chandler, Julie Grath  my camp girlfriend.
Monica, Did you break up with her?
Chandler,  No  we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers  and then I broke up with her.
Monica, Why?
Chandler, Well  ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
Monica, Fat?!
Chandler," I did not say fat! I said  ""Fa-aa-aw-ow…"""
Monica, You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Chandler, Yeah. Yeah  but it was a really  really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Monica, Well  apparently she does.
Chandler, Well  you know what they say  elephants never forget.  Seriously  good luck marrying me.
Joey, Hey! What’s going on?
Rachel, Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
Joey, Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs  remember? 
Rachel,  You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe, See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
Rachel, All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
Phoebe, Na-uh  I am!
Rachel, How come you are?!
Phoebe, Because I cared enough to lie!
Joey, Hey-hey-hey-hey  I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah  we could have like uh  like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.
Phoebe, What are you talking about?
Joey, Like when I want a job  I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see  they give me the part.
Phoebe, Okay  so after this audition  who decides who gets it?
Joey, Oh uh  me and Ross can be the judges.
Phoebe,  Well  it’s better than us deciding.
Rachel, Oh  come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
Phoebe, No! Coins hate me!
Rachel, Okay. Okay fine  y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.   Hiiiii  Ross! Sweetie.
Phoebe, Hey there  you handsome thing. 
Ross, Wow  this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Joey, Hi.
Ross, Just uh  brought back your videos.
Joey, Uh hey look uh Ross  look I think we need to talk about before.
Ross, No! No we don’t!
Joey, Yes we do! Now look  that was the best nap I ever had!!
Ross, I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Joey, Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Ross, I’ve had better.
Joey, Okay! When?!
Ross, All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Joey, Uh-huh!
Ross, I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
Joey, I want to do it again.
Ross, We can’t do it again.
Joey, Why not?
Ross, Because it’s weird!
Joey, Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ross, Sure  what do you got?
Joey, Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. 
Monica, Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Chandler, Can you figure out what I’m doing?
Monica, You’re Lewis Posin.
Chandler, Who?
Monica, Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade  and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler, Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Monica, No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it  it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know  I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler, What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica, No  I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Chandler, Okay  I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Joey, Okay  all right  this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10  1 being the highest.
Ross, No  10 is the highest.
Joey, Why is 10 the highest?
Ross, Because it’s the highest.  Okay  Rachel you’re up first.  Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica  the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! 
Joey,  I don’t want to marry Chandler!
Rachel, Okay  uh…
Joey, I’ve got cold feet.
Rachel, …it’s gonna be okay!
Joey, No  one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!
Rachel, Look Monica  getting cold feet is very common. Y’know  it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also  I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
Joey,  Very good! Drawing on your own experience  I like that!
Rachel, Thanks!
Ross, Yes  very nice Rachel.
Rachel, Thank you judges.
Phoebe, Ugh  what a kiss ass.
Rachel, Oh!
Joey, Okay  Phoebe…
Phoebe, Yes! Your honor?
Joey," We’re now in the ceremony  Monica is about to say  ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
Ross,  When Monica was a little girl  I remember that——Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Phoebe, Oh!
Joey, Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Rachel, Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Phoebe, Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Ross, It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Rachel, Ohh  wait a minute  we haven’t pre…
Ross, Go!
Rachel, Okay! Okay! Umm  Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay  never mind! Forget it! Umm  umm  okay  uh… I met  I-I met  I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25  although he seemed like a six year old.
Rachel, Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm  I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Joey, Wow.  Good speech.
Ross, Yeah  it really was!
Rachel, Aw  thanks!
Ross, Okay Phoebe  I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.
Joey, Yeah.
Phoebe, Okay  I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together  naked. 
Joey, And she’s back in the game.
Chandler,  Julie hi! Chandler Bing  I  I guess you remember me.
Chandler,  It’s a nickname  I’ll explain later.
Monica, It’s pretty clear.
Chandler, Ah  uh  I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Chandler, You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well  I guess my work here is done!
Joey, All right  well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well  except for Rachel—Damnit!
Phoebe, Really?! I won!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, I’m sorry Rach  it was  it was really close.
Rachel, Well then I demand a recount! 
Ross, Actually  it wasn’t that close.
Rachel, No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway  this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin!  All right?!  Heads! 
Phoebe, The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rachel, Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her  her vegetarian  voodoo  goddess circley shower! 
Phoebe,  Rach  it’s gonna be okay!  You guys are the best!
Joey, Boy I tell ya  that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross, Yeah?
Joey, Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. 
Ross, Why-why would I care about that?
Joey, No reason  I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.
Chandler, As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Monica, Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.
Chandler, I would really love it if could do both.
Monica, All right  I…I have to ask.
Chandler, What?
Monica, Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler, What?!
Monica, Well  you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Chandler, A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica, In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
Chandler, Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody  but I was 15!
Monica, Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm  you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler, Okay. Okay  now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica, How?
Chandler, You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica, What if I have babies  okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that  but I’m not sure that you are!
Chandler, Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin  beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look  what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Monica, Keep going.
Chandler, So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Monica, Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Chandler, I’d carry you around in my pocket.
Monica, I love you. 
Chandler, Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
Rachel, Hi Pheebs.
Phoebe, Hi!
Rachel, Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
Phoebe, That’s ridiculous Rachel  we were all babies once.  Oh  you mean today.
Rachel, Yeah. Yeah  and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it  if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Phoebe, Oh yeah!
Rachel, Yeah! Oh  umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together  y’know just in case…
Phoebe, Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
Rachel, Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny  look  this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  And look  she made me carry her train  which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Phoebe, Ohh.
Rachel, And umm  vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause  people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
Phoebe, This stuff is great!
Rachel, Oh  I forgot this was in here. Umm  this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…
Phoebe, Y’know Rach  I think that  I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
Rachel, You do? Why?
Phoebe, Because I think it means more to you.
Rachel, But Pheebs  y’know you earned it.
Phoebe, Its fine. I mean  this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what  14? 
Rachel, No  I was ten. I just developed early.
Phoebe,  Man alive!
Monica,  Hey  what’s going on?
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Well  we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Monica,  Ohh  wow! That’s great!  Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have  I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say  6:30  my place? I’m so excited! 
Rachel, Yeah okay  you laugh now  but she’s gonna be yours. 
Joey, Great nap.
Ross, It really was.
Joey,  Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! 
Ross,  Excuse me. 
Joey, Morning!
Rachel, Hi! Oh  how was your date last night?
Joey, Pretty good.
Rachel, Oh good.  Ahhh! My God  sorry! 
Joey, Okay  really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.
Rachel, What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
Joey, Yeah—Hey  don’t worry  she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen  could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.
Rachel, Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Joey, Just casually slip it in  y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh  I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Rachel, Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember  can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
Joey, Hey  I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on  Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus  he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.
Rachel, Well forget it  I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Joey, Fine!  Now  where’d we land on those pancakes? 
Rachel, Hi.
Rachel, Yeah  Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Rachel, Hi.
Rachel,  Would you like some pancakes?
Chandler, …Come on! Why are we here?!
Ross, Okay  okay take a guess.
Chandler, The hot chicks?
Ross, Okay  okay  I was typing names into the library computer earlier  y’know-y’know for fun  and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah  it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! 
Chandler, Wow that’s actually pretty cool.
Ross,  Oh umm  there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?
Chandler, Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Chandler, You didn’t bring me here to do that  did you?
Monica, She sent the chicken back again?!
Monica, Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Monica,  Lucky bastard!  Janice.
Monica, I’m fine.
Monica, Oh… Uh…
Chandler, OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie  are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married  did you?
Monica, Well  she saw the ring.
Chandler, Did she freak out?
Monica, Well  she was shocked when I told her  but then again so were most people.
Chandler, Right.
Monica, Well  she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself  named Clark. Uh  she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
Chandler,  You said no right?
Monica, Huh?
Chandler, You said no right?!
Monica, Well  she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean  what was I supposed to do?!
Chandler, Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!
Monica, Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
Chandler, What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Monica, Oh my God  she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Chandler, Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Monica, So-so you would’ve just lied?
Chandler, Yes!!
Monica, Would it really have been that easy?
Chandler, Yes!!!
Monica, Good  so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.
Joey, Hey! What’s up?
Joey, Hey-hey  who’s your friend?  Hey!!
Joey, Erin! Still here!
Rachel, Yeah  we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Joey, Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.
Rachel, I know!
Phoebe, Okay!
Joey, Yeah. I’ll uh  I’ll call ya.
Rachel, Oh and I’ll call ya too!
Phoebe, And call me!
Joey,  Okay  good to see you again.
Joey, Bye-bye.
Rachel, Bye!
Joey, So  system kinda broke down huh?!
Rachel, Oh Joey  I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…
Phoebe, We want you to marry her!
Joey, What?!!
Phoebe, She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Joey, No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Rachel, Cupid.
Phoebe, Joey  she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
Joey, Man  do you know what guys want!
Rachel, Look Joey  come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet  she-she likes baseball  and she-she had two beers at lunch.
Joey, My beers?! Look you guys  she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time  but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.
Phoebe, Yeah  but you always say that.
Rachel, Yeah  maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Joey, Look I’m sorry you guys  I-I just don’t think so.
Phoebe, Whatever.
Rachel, Fine. 
Joey, Hey  don’t start judging me!  Huh? You’re the one who’s in love with her assistant!  Huh? And you  you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
Rachel, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Secret affair!
Ross, People are doing it in front of my book!
Rachel, I’m sorry?
Ross, My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school  I went to see it  and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
Rachel, Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Ross, Let me ask you something  at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh  fool around.
Rachel, Yeah  there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes  there was.
Ross, Great! Because people kept showing up  I think it’s like uh-a thing!
Joey, Now hold on a second  fifth floor against that back wall?
Ross, Oh for cryin’ out loud! 
Joey, All right  so we should go catch our movie.
Rachel, Well now what’s the rush?
Joey, I like to see the previews.  The candy.
Phoebe,  Oh. Hey!
Rachel, Well look who’s here!
Joey, Hey!
Joey, Erin.
Rachel, Hi! Well  we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Rachel, Oh Phoebe  we forgot that party we have to go to.
Phoebe, Oh no.
Joey,  What party?
Joey, Who’s birthday party?
Joey,  Oh  and how is Allison?
Rachel,  Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!
Joey,  Yeah  look how that worked out.
Ross, Excuse me. Hi  I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section  fifth floor  stack 437?
Ross, No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! 
Ross, Hi  I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well  rolling around in front of it.
Ross, Well  fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word  I’ll go up there and defend it myself!  And don’t you follow me!
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, How did it go with Erin?
Joey, Oh  unbelievable! We had the best time!
Phoebe, Yay!! Oh so  you’re not  you’re not mad at us anymore?
Joey, No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward  we were really nervous.
Phoebe, Didn’t you sleep together?
Joey, Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches  sports  although she is a Met fan  not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids  well that’s a…
Rachel,  Oh my God! Listen to you talkin’ about having kids. Oh my Joey.  Oh  please don’t get married before I do.
Joey, Okay.
Monica, He might still show up.
Monica, Is that all?
Chandler, Well actually uh  there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um  it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh  tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
Monica, It’s actually going to be just family.
Joey, How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Joey, What about Game 1 of the Series?
Joey, You shut up!  I love arguing with her.  I’ll be right back.
Rachel, So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
Rachel, Okay? Wait okay  tell-tell me that you like him  please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Rachel, But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Phoebe, Then change it back!
Phoebe, No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
Rachel, Ugh  tramp!
Phoebe, Does Joey have any idea?
Phoebe, Yeah  you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
Phoebe, Yeah  and maybe that you’re a real 
Phoebe, Oh well  I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
Joey,  Hey! You wanna go?
Joey, Okay. See you guys later.
Rachel, Yeah  see ya.
Joey,  Hey  thank you so much. 
Rachel, Wow. Well  I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Phoebe, No  just a regular old flying dwarf.
Ross, Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Ross, Oh-oh  you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for  hmm? Perhaps   perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
Ross, Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh  meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?
Ross, I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
Ross, I’m a professor here uh  Ross…Geller.
Ross, Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!
Ross, Well I uh  I skipped forth grade.
Ross, I am very…very sorry.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, So how was  how was your date?
Joey, Oh  it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place  split a milkshake  70/30 but still… And guess what  I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
Phoebe, Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
Joey, No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise  but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Rachel, Jo-Joey  look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm  I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh  she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
Joey, Where are you gettin’ this?
Rachel, Well  she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
Joey, Oh. Oh.
Rachel, Joey…
Joey, No hey Rach  it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too!  Right?
Phoebe, Hey Joey  y’know what? You are way to good for her.
Rachel, Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
Joey, No! No. Don’t do that  just next time make sure she really likes me.
Rachel, Well that too.  Joey?
Joey, Yeah?
Rachel, Do you want some pancakes?
Joey,  Finally!
Monica, What are we gonna do?
Chandler, I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler,  Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica, Janice  what umm  what are you doing here?
Monica,  Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?
Chandler, Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
Monica, Yeah  in-in-in the bathroom.
Monica, We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.
Chandler, No-no-no-no  if we let her stay  she will stay forever!
Monica, Kinda like your Barca lounger.
Chandler, Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
Monica, I never stop thinking about it.
Chandler, Janice  I’m sorry but umm  you can’t stay here tonight.
Chandler, Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized  but sadly you have not.
Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Monica, Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Chandler, Say again?
Monica, That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.
Chandler, Feelings  such strong feelings.
Monica, I mean  I realize that his feelings may never completely go away  but you can.
Ross,  Don’t sweat it  I’ve got this section covered. Yeah  in fact I’ve got this little baby  to shine in people’s eye——Okay  see you later.
Chandler, I just wanted to show Monica your book. 
Ross,  Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Chandler, No  no  no. No-no-no.
Ross, What  are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
Chandler, No  we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
Ross, What? That's like insanely easy!
Chandler, Now  that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one  or in some cases... fourteen .
Monica, It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people  so technically I didn't lose.
Ross, What? You forgot fourteen states?
Monica, Nobody cares about the Dakotas. 
Chandler, Oh  okay  time's up!
Rachel, All right  I got 48.
Chandler, Oh that's not bad  Pheebs?
Phoebe, Oh  I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery  and I have one: regular celery.
Chandler, Okay  so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables  Joey?
Joey, Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Ross, Wow  how many have you got?
Joey, Fifty-six!
Joey, Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
Chandler, Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.
Rachel,  How come we have one extra place setting?
Monica, 'Cause you invited your assistant.
Rachel, Oh  right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town  so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Monica, Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Rachel, Well  I was going to  but then I figured  you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect  you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
Monica, Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that  because it is so fake   but I still do.
Phoebe, Regular Celery!  Oh  I already have that. 
Ross, Done! With time a-to-spare.
Chandler, Oooh that may be a New World's record 
Ross," You know  I hate to lecture you guys  but it's kinda disgraceful  that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map  or one of those round  colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?"
Chandler, Uh  Magellan? You got 46 states. 
Ross, What? That's impossible.
Joey, 46. Wow! Who's well educated now  Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Monica, All right  I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please  watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Chandler, I am only one man!  Okay Ross  time is up!
Ross, No  just give me another minute.
Chandler, Look Ross  if you don't know them by now  you will never know them  okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Ross, This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right  uhh  I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Chandler, Okay  but if you can't…no dinner!
Ross, You're on!
Joey,  All right. Don't look at my list  Ross  'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Monica,  Hey  did you guys know  that your oven doesn't work?
Joey, But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay  right?
Monica, Ross  I'm gonna use yours  okay?
Ross, Pshhshhh!
Monica, Chandler? Can you give me a hand? 
Chandler, Sure  and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Joey, Don't worry  Chandler  it's not a globe of the United States.
Phoebe, Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Ross, Phoebe  why is your bag moving?
Phoebe, Oh  it's not!
Rachel, Seriously  it's moving!
Joey, What the hell is in there?
Phoebe, It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.
Monica, Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
Monica, That's my pie!
Chandler, Which smells delicious!
Monica, Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
Chandler, What?
Monica, We left Joey alone with the food!  Yep! Yep  I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!
Phoebe,  Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Monica, Phoebe  why is there a dog in our apartment?
Phoebe, I'm sorry  who's this?
Monica, Phoebe  there's a dog sitting on my couch!
Chandler, Tell her  I'm allergic  and I will sue!
Phoebe, No  there's no dog here?
Monica, Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and  he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Phoebe, Oh my god! Where are you? 
Monica, I'll be right there!
Phoebe,  They're here already? How are they doing this?
Rachel,  Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Rachel, Well  sure! Come in!  Well  what-what happened to your girlfriend?
Rachel, Oh  I'm sorry.
Ross, Ohio!! Thank you!
Chandler, Huh! Where is the dog?!
Ross, What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Joey, Yeah that dog left!
Monica,  Phoebe! Phoebe  open up!
Phoebe, There's no dog in here.
Chandler, Phoebe  we can hear the dog barking!
Phoebe, No that's just me coughing!  Oh  good  there you are! Listen  um  I have a dog in my room.
Chandler, What is it doing here?
Phoebe, Well  I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello  my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Monica, Oooh  I wish she could stay here  but Chandler is allergic!
Chandler, Extremely allergic  okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes  my throat will just close up!
Phoebe, That's odd  'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Chandler,  Really?
Monica, Chandler  if that dog's been here that long  and you haven't had a reaction  maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Chandler, Well  it still has to go  right?
Chandler, Okay  it's um…
Joey,  Don't do it!
Monica, Don't do what?
Chandler,  I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay  I hate dogs.
Phoebe, Are you crazy?
Ross, Are you out of your mind?
Phoebe, Why?
Joey, Told ya. 
Chandler, They are needy  they are jumpy  and you can't tell what they are thinking  and that scares me a little bit.
Ross, Right  they are scary.  Ahh  she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Rachel, Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean  not even puppies?
Chandler,  Is there a puppy here?
Chandler,  Okay  you are new!
Joey, Look  Chandler  I told you  never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.
Phoebe, You don't like ice cream?
Ross, It's too cold.
Chandler, Okay  it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Ross,  It hurts my teeth.
Chandler, And I don't wanna say this  I don't you guys to hate me  but uh  I don't think  I can be around that dog anymore. Okay  so either the dog goes  or I go.  Oh my god!!
Ross, How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.
Monica, 1250.
Ross, Damn  I forgot you were here.
Phoebe, All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute. 
Rachel, Oh  wait before you guys go  can I just ask you a question?
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend  what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Phoebe, Oh  I'd say about a month.
Monica, Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Joey, Half hour. 
Rachel, Interesting.
Monica, When it's your assistant  I would say never.
Joey, All right  Rach  the big question is  does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you  this is all a moo-point.
Rachel, Huh. A moo-point?
Joey, Yeah  it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Rachel,  Have I been living with him for too long  or did that all just make sense?
Monica, Please  don't listen to Joey  okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Rachel, You're right  I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay  that's what I'm gonna do.
Joey, Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty  no one cares what's inside.
Rachel, Hey!
Rachel, How are you holding up?
Rachel, Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
Rachel, So were you guys together a long time?
Rachel, Now that she broke up with you?
Rachel, Yeah. Hmmmm.
Rachel, No…Yeah  all the time  constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.
Rachel, Because  uh—it has to.
Rachel, Yeah  I know  I do. I really do.
Rachel, Well  what is a boss for? Hug it out! 
Joey,  All right  he likes you back! Huh? Told ya  you should go for it!
Joey,  Street noise drowned any of that out?  No  all right  I see you later  okay... 
Rachel, Uh  yeah  well  see  he… Joey knows  that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and  and…you're hugging me  so obviously you are not repulsed by it  yeah!
Rachel, No?  All right  here's the truth um  Joey said what he said  because um  I'm attracted to you.
Rachel, Yeah  I admit it. I have a crush on you  and uh  and  and I know that's crazy because we work together  and-and nothing could ever happen  and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Okay  that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
Rachel,  Wait  we still have time to talk and they’re-they're not even in the car yet!  Oh look  there they go  okay. 
Monica, Okay Phoebe  we should probably go back now.
Phoebe,  Please don't leave me  I'll be lonely.
Monica, Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.
Phoebe, Yeah  okay.
Monica, Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh  I can't leave her!
Phoebe, You know if you want  we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
Monica, That's not gonna work.
Phoebe, I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Monica, Hey! I didn't know either.
Phoebe, Yeah  but you kinda knew that something was going on  didn't you?
Monica, Yeah  I knew.
Phoebe, Where's Chandler?
Chandler,  Here I am.
Phoebe, Wash your hands!!!
Chandler, How did you…know? 
Ross, Hey! What's she doing back here?
Monica, Relax  Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Ross, Hey look  Phoebe. I  uh  I laid out the states geographically...
Phoebe,  No  no  we don't really have time for this right now. Okay  we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Ross, Yeah  but  but look what I'm...
Phoebe, See  this is exactly what we do not have time for. 
Chandler,  Where's Monica?
Ross, Um  in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.
Chandler, Why not?
Ross, Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.
Chandler, Well  I  I should go in there.
Ross, No. No  no. She doesn't want to see you right now.
Chandler, Why not?
Ross, Because you sent away the dog!
Chandler, This is ridiculous. 
Ross, Oh  is it? Is it? Look  when Monica and I were kids  we had a dog named Rover. And  uh  one day  my dad decides  he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.
Joey,  Okay  I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter?
Chandler, Monica's all upset  because I sent Clunkers away.
Joey, So? Bring the dog back  you're a hero.
Chandler, Yeah  I can be a hero  I could do that. I could  I could do... I  w-w-what if  what if it attacks me?
Joey, Chandler  it's like a big gerbil.
Chandler, And that doesn't scare you? 
Joey, Ross  you need some help?
Ross, From you?  Yes  please!
Joey,  First of all  Utah? Dude  you can't just make stuff up!
Ross, I hate America! When I finish this game  I swear I am moving.
Joey, Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
Rachel, Yeah  ohh! Why  damnit  why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee  I-I know that I freaked him out
Joey, If you said it like that  you probably did  yeah.
Phoebe,  Hey  is Chandler here?
Chandler, No  no he went for a walk.
Phoebe, Okay  but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!
Rachel,  Hi!
Joey, Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Phoebe, Oh no  the dog's not going to be there!
Joey, You think?
Monica, Hi  honey.
Chandler, Please  please  please  don't be mad at me.
Monica, What? Why  why would...
Phoebe,  Shh  wait and see. Maybe we will  maybe we won't.
Chandler, Okay  I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know  for you  and… I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere  all over the apartment  including the roof  which FYI Ross  one of your neighbors  growing weed. I couldn't find him  and I am so  so  so  sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. 
Phoebe, We have good news  look whose back!
Rachel,  Hi!
Chandler, Clunkers?! Oh my god!
Monica, That's right  she came back all by herself.
Phoebe, It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Chandler,  It is so good to see you!
Phoebe, Yeah  she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh  the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… I went to far  didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Ross, Okay  maybe this is so hard  because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something  I have 49 states  and there are no more! I-I think  I should be able to eat something.
Chandler, It's up to you.
Rachel, Oh  hi! How are you doing?
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't  uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh  so  where did you say you're from again?
Ross, Ah  what good are you. 
Rachel, Look  um  I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Rachel, Ah  I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together  so nothing could really ever happen between us  and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday  and-and never talk about this again  okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So  we're okay?
Rachel, Oh  god  I know it  that I freaked you out.
Rachel, Really?
Rachel, Okay  well  that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Ross, Delaware!  Delaware!
Chandler, All right.
Ross,  I want my turkey now!
Chandler, You got it.  You got Nevada twice.
Ross,  I know.
Chandler, Yeah. 
Ross, You sure?
Chandler, Okay  let me just straighten out your helmet there. 
Ross, No-no  one daddy  two mommies. All right  it’s all yours. 
Chandler, Okay. Okay.
Ross, Yes! Yes! Yes!! 
Phoebe, His first big kid’s bike  this is so exciting!
Monica, Oh yeah  I remember mine! Ohh  it was my sixth birthday  my dad took me to the park  I got it  and…it bent.
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe, I never had a bike of my own.
Ross,  What?!
Phoebe, Well  we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips  and-and-and a bell and this big  white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Chandler, That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.
Ross, Ohh.
Monica, Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Phoebe, No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Ross, That is so unfair!
Phoebe, Not really  I got to drag him around too! 
Chandler, Hey! What are you guys doing?
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Chandler, I’m sorry  who?
Monica, I’m gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
Chandler, But we don’t know the neighbors.
Joey, I do. There’s uh  let’s see  Guy With a Mustache  Smokes-A-Lot Lady  Some Kids I’ve Seen  and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Monica, See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Chandler, Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?
Rachel,  Gooood morning!!
Chandler, Eh  somebody’s in a good mood!
Rachel, Well  why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Monica, Where you can make out with your assistant.
Rachel, Come on  it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Monica, Oh yeah  what’s the plan?
Rachel,  We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
Monica, Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Rachel, Well y’know  we did other stuff too. 
Monica, Did you two…
Rachel, Oh Monica come on  y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!
Monica, Matt Guire  Mark Lynn  Ben Wire…
Rachel, Anymore!!
Monica, Okay.
Rachel, Hi. Tag  I have a conference call today is that correct?
Rachel, Okay  thank you. That’ll be all.   Wait! Wait!  Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us. 
Rachel, Okay  you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.
Rachel, Well  you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know  there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate. 
Rachel, No  I’ve just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
Monica, The basket is totally empty! My God  the neighbors ate all the candy!
Chandler, Well  either that or uh…
Monica, Joey!!
Joey, Yeah?
Monica, Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Joey, Uh well yeah  that was the plan  but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Phoebe, Yeah  and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
Monica, They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!! 
Joey, Hey Mon  you might wanna make some more lasagna too  because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Monica, Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Ross, Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!!  Pheebs  you uh  you got a second.
Phoebe, Sure!
Ross, Yeah  ever since you uh  told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean  everyone should have a-a first bike  so…
Phoebe,  Oh my God Ross!!
Ross, You like it?
Phoebe, I love it!!
Ross, Yeah?
Phoebe, Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Ross, Ahh.
Phoebe, Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Ross, Ah!  Well uh-uh  t-take it downstairs  y’know give it a test ride.
Phoebe, Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I’ve ever gotten.
Ross,  You’re welcome.
Phoebe,  Oh and Chandler’s about to cry.
Chandler,  Am not!
Monica,  Who is that?!
Chandler, Don’t worry  I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please?
Monica, Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Monica, Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler,  4:00 A.M.
Chandler, I am sorry  but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica, Umm  listen I am sorry  but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.
Monica, Um-hmm.
Chandler, Mm! Night Gar’! 
Rachel,  So did you read your evaluation yet?
Rachel,  Okay please  you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
Rachel, I’m thinkin’ no.
Rachel, Umm  I said I thought you were a good kisser  and uh  and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
Rachel," Well  it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote  ""Yes  he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision "" and under Problems with Performance I wrote  ""Dear God  I hope not "" and then uh  then I drew a little smiley face  and then a small pornographic sketch."
Monica, Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story  I almost cried.
Joey, Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Chandler, Hey  you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Joey,  Those two only had each other!
Ross, Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Monica, Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh  these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Joey, Yeah  I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
Ross, Wait a minute  she was walking the bike? Both times?
Joey, Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe, Oh hi!
Chandler, Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Phoebe, Ohh  uh-huh so much!
Ross, Pheebs you uh…you do know how to ride a bike don’t you?
Phoebe, Of course!
Monica, Umm  can we see you ride it?
Phoebe, Okay.  See?
Monica, See  this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Chandler,  What happened? I’m just eating candy.
Rachel, Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know  maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.
Chandler, Absolutely! Y’know  because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Rachel, Ugh  I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey, Hey Rach?
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey, That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this? 
Rachel, Oh my God! Joey!
Chandler, What is the matter with you?
Rachel, Ugh!
Joey, Boy I tell ya  this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Monica, I’m sorry  I can’t help you. See?  Rules are rules.
Monica, No kidding  out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?
Monica, Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven  but whatever.
Joey,  Hey Chandler  do we know that lady?
Chandler, Maybe  isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
Monica,  All right  I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!
Monica,  It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!
Chandler, Y’know what would work?
Monica, Hmm?
Chandler, Stop making candy!
Monica, But they like it!
Chandler, You mean they like you.
Monica, Maybe.
Chandler, Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica, Oh  you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh  funny man? 
Ross, Okay  now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…
Phoebe,  Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah  maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps  like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
Ross, Phoebe  you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
Phoebe, Why? Why do I have to learn?
Ross, Well…In-in case of emergency.
Phoebe, What kind of an emergency?
Ross," Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says  ""You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."""
Phoebe, Okay  I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Ross, Okay  Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
Phoebe, You won’t let go?
Ross, No!
Phoebe, Swear?!
Ross, I swear!
Phoebe,  Okay.
Ross, Come on.  All right  here we go. All right? 
Phoebe, All right.
Ross, All right. Feel good?
Phoebe, Well…
Ross, All right  try pedaling.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Ross, That’s it  your doing great.
Phoebe, Okay.
Ross, Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Phoebe, Weee!!! 
Ross, Yes!! Yes!!! 
Phoebe, Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Ross, I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…
Phoebe, I am shocked! Shocked!! 
Ross, It’s a legitimate learning technique.  Wow!
Ross, Hey  there’s uh  some people outside  askin’ about candy.
Monica, Well  they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!
Ross, Need some help?
Monica, No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!
Ross, By the way  the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me. 
Phoebe,  Oh  hello liar.
Ross,  Look  I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
Phoebe, I could’ve been killed I hope you know!
Ross, I know. I know. But  can we please try it again? Huh? I mean  you were so close Phoebe!
Phoebe, Well  I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects. 
Ross, Phoebe.
Phoebe, What?!  What the hell?!
Ross, All right  y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry  I’m just gonna have to take it back.
Phoebe, What?! Why?!
Ross, Because! Because  it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay  this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don’t ride it you-you’re-you’re killing its spirit!  The bike is dying.
Phoebe, All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap  okay.
Ross, Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
Phoebe,  Okay Ross!  Please don’t die!
Rachel, Okay  I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it  but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now  he doesn’t get in until 10  so he’s no problem  but his assistant  Betty  she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Rachel, Yeah  well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now  while I distract her  you get in the office.
Rachel, Let’s roll!
Rachel,  Yeah  sure Mr. Zelner  for you anything—minute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan  abort the plan. 
Rachel, Okay. Uh  well can we  can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? 
Rachel,  Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean   what would happen exactly.
Rachel, Well…
Rachel, Oh no-no-no…
Rachel, You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what?  It doesn’t matter.
Rachel, Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Rachel, No  you could’ve lost your job.
Rachel, Thank you! You’re great! 
Rachel, What?
Rachel, I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.
Rachel,  There it is. 
Chandler,  What is going on?
Joey, Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Chandler, Joey!
Joey, What’s up buddy?
Chandler, What are you doing?
Joey, Waiting for candy.
Chandler, Get in here!  Hey  and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas.
Monica,  Okay  guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Chandler, All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you  and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
Chandler, No not  Candy Lady.
Joey,  Hey  if we know it can we have candy?!!
Chandler, All right  y’know what? Forget it  all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!
Joey, That’s right  it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!  
Monica,  Thank you.
Chandler, You’re welcome. 
Monica, Did you smoke?
Chandler, No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?
Monica, I’m fine now  but it was really scary there for a while. I mean  someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
Joey,  Oh yeah  sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever  I don’t know… 
Phoebe, I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
Ross, Oh hey  don’t thank me  thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Phoebe, Don’t be so corny Ross  it’s not an after-school special. 
Chandler, Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Monica, Betrothed… 
Chandler, …betrothed couple.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!
Chandler, Pheebs?
Phoebe, Huh?
Chandler, Skull?
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  it's my mom's.
Rachel,  Oh my god!!
Phoebe, No  no  no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah  no  she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us  that even though it's Christmas  people still die. And  you can put candy in it. 
Ross,  Hey!
Monica,  Licorice?
Ross,  Sure!  Hey  I just found out  I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Monica, Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Ross, Nope. I mean  I know Susan does every year  but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Phoebe, And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Rachel, You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Ross, Hmm.
Joey, Hey. 
Rachel,  Did you know he was in there?
Monica, No.
Chandler, How long have we been home?
Monica, About a half an hour.
Chandler, Lovely!
Chandler, Hey  you know what I was thinking? When we get married  are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Why not?
Monica, Bing's weird.
Phoebe,  Oh  hey  you guys!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon  so I guess I'll be moving out.
Monica, Ahh  Phoebe  I'm gonna miss you!
Phoebe, Yes  you will be very sad. All right  well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Chandler, Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Phoebe, Yeah  why not?
Chandler, Well  she's just so much fun with Joey  I just assumed  she'd still be living with him.
Phoebe, Why do you think  she's having so much fun living with Joey?
Chandler, No reason  except…she…told…me.
Phoebe, Really? So she said  she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
Chandler, No! No  she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Monica, Phoebe  don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Phoebe, You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Monica, Well  no. But  um  I bet she probably does.
Phoebe," Probably? Yeah  I don't like that word.  Kind of what ‘probably’ really means. Yeah  uh-huh. Yeah  oh  ""Your mom probably won't kill herself "" y’know? I'm sorry  but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Y’know? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing! "
Chandler, Bing doesn't seem so weird now  does it?
Rachel,  Hey!
Joey, Hey! Great  you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas! 
Rachel, Drums?
Joey,  No! Drums!
Chandler,  Hi  could we get two burritos to go  please? 
Monica, I'm sorry. But not that sorry  'cause you don't have to live with it. Um  we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Chandler, Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
Chandler, Is this because of the burrito thing?
Monica,  You need to give him money.
Chandler, Give him money? It was a joke!
Monica, No  to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Chandler, Right  calm down  O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
Monica, You've got to be smooth about it.
Chandler, Hey  I can be smooth.  Listen  we're a little bit in a hurry  so  if you can get us a table a little quicker  I'd appreciate it. 
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, How did it go?
Chandler, Had the money in the wrong hand. 
Ross, Wooooooo  hehehe. Hey  ahh  you don't feel like you're gonna throw up  do ya?
Ross, Well  I do  so let's...  So  Ben  you uh  you know what holiday is coming up  don't ya?
Ross, Yep  and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Ross, Yes  but also  Hanukkah! See  you're part Jewish  and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Ross, Right  um  but  on Hanukkah  Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See  years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Ross,  Okay  that's right  yes  but on Hanukkah  uh  we sing  uh  Dreidel  dreidel  dreidel  I made you out of clay.
Ross,  Okay  it's not a contest.
Ross, Well  how about this year  instead of Santa  we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
Ross, No! Oh  no-no-no. Hey  you weren't bad  you've been very good  Ben.
Ross, No  hey-hey  come on   Ben  Santa is not mad at you  okay? Hey  you're-you're his favorite little guy!
Ross,  Yes! Santa's coming!
Monica, It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word  shake his hand and give him the money!
Chandler, How do you know so much about this?
Monica, I don't know.
Chandler, Richard used to do it  didn't he?
Monica, We'd be eating our soup right now.
Chandler, Mustached bastard…
Monica,  Okay  those people just left  come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!
Chandler,  Excuse me...
Chandler,  Ahh-hahaha! 
Rachel,  Ha!
Phoebe, So you like the drums! That's  that's great! Y’know  I was worried  that  you know  they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right  okay  well  apparently not! So  yay!
Joey, Hey-hey  Pheebs  check it out  we already learned a song.  Ready? One  two  three  four...
Phoebe, That's fun. 
Chandler, Thank you Gunther  put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you.
Joey, Thank you.   Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.
Chandler, Hey Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey! 
Chandler, If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building  why not get him something a little bit more subtle  like a wrecking ball  or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Monica," It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes  Joey throws his sticks in the air  and I have to hear  ""Oh my eye! Oh god  my eye!"" I mean  it is so annoying."
Phoebe, Yes  thank you. You see  this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Monica, Phoebe  you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel  so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Phoebe, Maybe on some level.
Rachel, Joey  y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
Joey, What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Phoebe,  Hey  Joey  I got you another present. 
Joey, Oh wait  before you tell me what it is!  Okay  what is it?
Phoebe, It's a…tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel  look  I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big  gross  scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
Rachel, What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah  I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died  because my cat ate it. And then  then my cat died. But Joey  isn't this cool?
Joey, Is it on me? I feel  I feel like it's on me! I got  hey! 
Rachel, Oh  isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
Phoebe,  Ah  yeah  he's so adorable  God  he's just so much fun  Joey is the best  I'm glad you're having so much fun here. 
Rachel, What? Wait-wait a minute  what? Phoebe  what's the matter?
Phoebe, Our apartment is ready.
Rachel, And that makes you angry because…
Phoebe, Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Rachel, Where did you get that?
Phoebe, Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Rachel, Phoebe?
Phoebe, Hm?
Rachel, Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey  if you wanted to do that  you might as well just gotten him a fish  you know how fish freaked me out!
Phoebe,  Fish!
Rachel, It wouldn't have mattered anyway  Phoebe  you and I are  are gonna live together  we're roommates; that's the deal.
Phoebe, Yes  but I wanted you to want to live with me  but okay  if you're having so much fun over here…
Rachel, Oh  it's so much more fun with you.
Phoebe, We did have fun  didn't we?
Rachel, We did!
Phoebe, Oh  anyway  they say  if we want  we can see it tonight.
Rachel, Oh  I would love to!
Phoebe, Yay  okay!
Rachel, Good  good  good  good  good. 
Phoebe, Great  all right  okay  and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Rachel,  Um...  Done!
Ross, Hey!
Ross, No  these are my pants.
Ross, Well  uh  do you have a Santa-outfit left?
Ross, Okay look  do-do  you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son  and I really don't want to disappoint him  um  come on  I…uh  you gotta have something.
Ross, I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!
Monica, What happened to Santa  Holiday Armadillo?
Ross,  Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.
Monica, Wow  come in  have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.
Ross, That's right  Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But  Santa sent me here to give you these presents  Ben.  Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.
Ross, You're welcome  Ben. Merry Christmas  ooh  and Happy Hanukkah!
Ross,  You are? Me  too!
Monica, Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Ross,  You wanna wander in the hall?  Ooh  hey Ben  what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Ross, Yeah!
Monica, Come on Ben.
Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler,  Ho  ho  ho! Merry Christmas!
Chandler, Hey! 
Ross, What are you doing here  Santa?
Chandler, Well  I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here  weird…turtle-man?
Ross, I'm the Holiday Armadillo  your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler, What?
Chandler, You bet I did  Ben  put it there!   Well  it would have worked this time  if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho  ho  ho!
Monica, Okay Ben  why don't you come open some more presents  and Santa  the Armadillo  and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence  I never thought I'd say.
Ross,  What are you doing?
Chandler, You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume  so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross, Thank you  but  but you gotta leave.
Chandler, Why?
Ross, Because  I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah  and  and you're-you’re wrecking it.
Chandler, But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross, I'm sorry  Chandler but this  this is really important to me.
Chandler, Fine  I'll give the suit back.
Monica,  Hey  you think  you can keep it another night? 
Chandler, Santa? Really?
Monica, Yes  is that okay?
Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Then it's okay! 
Ross, Okay Ben  Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
Chandler, Because  if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Ross, Fine  I-I give up. Santa  Santa can stay.
Chandler, Well  I'll stay  but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben  will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Ross, All right  it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago  there were these people called the Maccabees.
Joey,  Merry Christmas!
Rachel, Oh wow! Look at this place!
Phoebe, Oh  this is terrible. Oh  they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
Rachel,  Oh my God!
Phoebe, What?
Rachel,  Okay  remember uh  remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, Do you really not know where I’m going with this?  It left! It’s one huge room!
Phoebe, Oh no!   Oh! Wow!!!
Rachel, See?
Phoebe, Well  I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
Rachel, You can’t  because of the new skylight!
Phoebe, There’s a skylight?!  Wow!!
Rachel, So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
Phoebe,  Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um  my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Rachel, Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?
Phoebe, A little bit  yeah.
Rachel, Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
Phoebe, You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Rachel, Phoebe  it’s okay. I like living with Joey.
Phoebe, Are you sure?
Rachel, Oh please  I hate packing  it’s closer to work  and we do have fun. Although  I’m really gonna miss living with you.
Phoebe, Oh me too.
Rachel, I know.  Oh-oh  wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen  I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother  she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?
Phoebe, No  I do not hear that.
Ross, …and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day  burned for…
Ross, That’s right  and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Ross, Yeah?
Chandler, My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. 
Ross, The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben  it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles! 
Rachel,  Hey!
Phoebe, Oh.
Rachel,  Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
Ross, Come on  come on  we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!
Rachel, Oh.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Okay  I understand why Superman is here  but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
Rachel, I got it!
Joey,  Is it back in the cage?
Rachel, Its back in cage!
Joey, Cage closed?
Rachel, Joey  would you just come out here and stop being such a baby!
Chandler, Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel,  Hi.
Chandler, Hey  you have got to try this cheesecake.
Rachel, Oh  y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I——Wow. My God  so creamy. Oh my God  this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this? 
Chandler,  It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Rachel, Chandler  this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.
Chandler, I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Rachel, Why  why not?
Chandler, Because it's too delicious.
Rachel, Chandler  you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Chandler, No-no-no! It is going to be okay  because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate   Momma’s Little Bakery.  I feel terrible  I’m a horrible  horrible  horrible person.
Rachel,  Oh  I’m sorry what?
Joey, All right  I should get going  big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today  they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.
Chandler, So…
Joey, Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants  it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey  so Pheebs  we still on for tonight?
Phoebe, Absolutely!
Joey, I’ll see you at 8:00.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Chandler, Oh  what’s at 8:00?
Phoebe, Oh  I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross, Wow  did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe, Duly noted.
Ross, Thanks.   Oh! So for tomorrow  do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica, What are you talking about?
Ross, Cousin Frannie’s wedding  its tomorrow night.
Monica, You were invited?!
Ross, No.
Monica, My God  I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited  but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
Chandler, Well  maybe since the age of 9  Frannie’s made some new friends.
Ross, Well l-look okay  it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Monica, Yeah  well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times  okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her  there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.
Ross, Y’know  she tried to undress me too.
Chandler, I used to undress my cousin Glenn. 
Phoebe, Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Rachel, Umm  I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?
Phoebe, Well  I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green  I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note. 
Rachel,"  ""Pheebs  can’t make it  got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy.""  Big Daddy?"
Phoebe, Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.
Ross, Hey  y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron! 
Joey,  Hey!
Phoebe, Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!
Joey, Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Phoebe, So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!
Joey, Hey  you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
Ross, Phoebe he’s right  that is the rule.
Phoebe, I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans  I expect you to show up. Okay  I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go  but this  is for life!
Joey, Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Phoebe, Well  it does.
Joey, Okay  can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry.  How about uh  dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
Phoebe, Okay  you wore me down.
Ross, Hey Joe  while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Joey, The Ross—Is that back?!! 
Rachel, Hi!
Chandler, Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel, So just bring it back downstairs  what’s the problem?
Chandler, I can’t seem to say goodbye.
Rachel, Are you serious?! Chandler  we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Chandler, Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
Rachel, It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery  crumbly  graham cracker crust  with a very rich yet light  cream cheese filling…  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Chandler,  Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Rachel, Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.
Chandler, Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Rachel, Momma’s Little Bakery  Chicago  Illinois. 
Joey, Awww! Mel Torme died.
Monica, Joey  that paper’s like a year old!
Joey, Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!
Ross,  Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Ross, So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh  there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.
Monica, Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!
Ross, Well yeah  but she doesn’t know that. I mean  the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Monica,  Limited seating! Oh  that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!
Ross, Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony  just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better  Joan and I will just make an appearance and then  and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.
Monica, Joan?
Ross, Yeah  Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall  very beautiful  and despite what some people say  not broad backed!
Monica," Wait a minute  you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got ""and guest?!"""
Joey, Uh-uh  excuse me  I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know  since she has a chance to get on broad back…
Ross,  Not broad backed!
Monica, Wait a minute  y’know  you’re bringing me!
Ross, What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
Monica, Why not?!
Ross, Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department  okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Monica, Because! She’s my cousin. I mean  we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.
Ross, Okay  all right  I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan. 
Joey, Aww that’s nice. Family should be there  huh? This is her wedding  happiest day of her life.
Monica,  We’ll see.
Chandler, Well  thank you for lunch.
Rachel, What? Wait a minute  I didn’t pay  I thought you paid!
Chandler, So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?
Rachel,  Its still there! 
Chandler, Mrs. Braverman must be out. 
Rachel, She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
Chandler, By then  the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
Rachel, No that could kill her.
Chandler, Well  we don’t want that.
Rachel, No so we’re protecting her.
Chandler, But we should take it.
Rachel, But we should move quick.
Chandler, Why?
Rachel, Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Chandler, Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
Phoebe,   Oh my God! That’s David!
Monica, David who?
Phoebe, David the scientist guy  David that I was in love with  David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
Phoebe, Oh  you say someone’s name enough  they turn around.
Phoebe, David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?
Phoebe, Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, Well  of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.
Phoebe, Really?
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe,  Yes! Oh no!
Phoebe, I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans  I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
Monica, Phoebe  can I talk to you for a second?
Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
Monica, What are you doing?
Phoebe, Well  I have plans with Joey tonight.
Monica, So! He’ll understand!
Phoebe, No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica  I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because  potentially  the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night  I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No  if I don’t have my principles  I don’t have anything!
Monica, God  you are so strong.
Phoebe, Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
Rachel,  Oh my God! That is so good!
Chandler, I’m full  and yet I know if I stop eating this  I’ll regret it.
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey,  What do you got there?
Rachel, Oh it’s umm  it’s tofu cake. Do you want some? 
Chandler, What are you doing tonight?
Joey, Huh? Uh… 
Chandler, Dude! Dude! 
Joey, Oh!  Sorry. Uh  I’ve got those plans with Phoebe  why?
Chandler, Oh really? Uh  Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Joey, What?! Tonight?!
Chandler, That’s what Monica said.
Joey, After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Ross, Oh here  I think this is us.  Yeah.
Monica, Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!
Monica, I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Monica, Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Ross,"  Stop saying  ""Blood"" to strangers."
Monica,  So  how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Monica, Okay  you’re fine.
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Yes! I will have the green salad  umm the house salad  and water’s fine.
Phoebe, Okay.
Joey, Yeah  this slow roasted salmon  just how slow are we talkin’ here?
Joey, Ohh  then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Phoebe, Oh Joey  we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib  mahi mahi  and a very special lobster ravioli. 
Joey, Oh well  that changes everything!  Y’know what Pheebs?
Phoebe, Huh?
Joey, You were right before. I mean  friends are so important.
Phoebe,  Yeah  I’m very wise. I know.
Joey, Y’know-y’know what I really want?
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Is to have a long  long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Joey, Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Phoebe, God Joey  this is taking forever!
Joey, What’s the rush? What?
Phoebe, W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.
Joey, Whoa-whoa  what is it?
Phoebe, Well… It’s a date.
Joey, A date?! No  no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken  because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Phoebe, Come on Joey  don’t make me feel badly about this.
Joey, No  I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah  you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs  you’re doing the same thing!
Phoebe, That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David  the scientist guy? Okay  he’s very special to me.
Joey, Okay  well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Phoebe, She was?
Joey, Well  she graduated from high school!
Phoebe, Okay  whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours  and I’m gonna go see him! 
Joey, Fine!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Joey, Fine!
Phoebe, Yeah! 
Joey,  What are you still doin’ here?! I told you  lobster ravioli!
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh  I wouldn’t miss this.
Phoebe, Oh  you’re such a gentleman.  Come on! We’re going to my place! 
Chandler, Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Rachel,  Mm-mmm. 
Chandler, I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Rachel, Oh  what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Chandler, Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first  and I’m takin’ it back! 
Rachel, What?! What?!
Chandler, Oh yes!
Rachel, Wait a minute!
Chandler, Oh yes!
Rachel, Oh no-no-no-no-no  no you don’t!
Chandler, Oh yes! Oh yes!
Rachel, You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Chandler, Well that’s not fair  you’ve already had some!
Rachel, What? Oh  well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
Chandler, What do we use to split it?
Rachel, Okay!  All right  pick a half.
Chandler,  Okay well  this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So  maybe if I measured…
Rachel, Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Chandler, All right  I’ll pick that one. 
Rachel, That’s also the smaller piece.  Okay  there you go. Enjoy your half my friend  but that is it. No sharing. No switching  and don’t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast.  Oh!!!!
Chandler,  Ohhh!
Rachel, Okay  you gotta give me some of your piece.
Chandler, Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing  and don’t come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my… 
Ross, Oh  hey Aunt Millie.
Ross, Yes  yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Monica, Here’s Frannie. Hmm  won’t she be happy to see me? 
Ross, Now wait a minute  you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.
Monica, Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Ross, That bitch! 
Monica, Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Ross,  Hi Frannie  congratulations.
Monica, You invite my brother  you invite my whole family  and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!  Stuart!
Ross, So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Phoebe, Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…
Phoebe, That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
Phoebe, That’s good. I got to admit  I thought it was something else.
Phoebe, You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.
Phoebe, I do too. 
Phoebe,  Okay  now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Joey, No! No! No Pheebs  I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know  started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs  come here.  Are you okay?
Phoebe, No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again. 
Joey, Hey  y’know you could always visit him.
Phoebe, Oh right  like they’re gonna let me have a passport.
Joey, Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Phoebe, Well—But—Now  if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does  then he can come back. 
Joey, I can give it a shot.
Rachel, Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
Chandler, Stick to your side!
Rachel, Hey  come on now!
Joey,  All right  what are we havin’? 
Monica, Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Ross, What? Oh  okay. Wait here. 
Ross, Well…
Ross, Why?! Why on the lips?! 
Monica,  Ross  when’s this comet thing start?
Ross, Well  technically it seven billion years ago… 
Ross, Okay! Okay! Fine  I’ll stop! No teaching  okay? We’ll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.  Okay? Who’s official name is Bapstein-King.
Phoebe,  There it is! Oh  look at that! Isn’t Mother Nature amazing?
Chandler,  That’s a plane!
Phoebe, Well  all right. 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high  that’s pretty amazing too.
Rachel, No. No  you can’t.
Rachel, Oh I don’t-I don’t know.
Ross, Man  look at all those stars!  Infinite space. It really  really makes you wonder  doesn’t it?
Joey,  Y’know what else makes you wonder?
Ross, Huh?
Joey, Check out the rack on this chick! 
Monica, Okay  we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean  Chandler’s getting chilly. 
Chandler,  No  I’m not!
Joey, Then why are you wearing Monica’s jacket?
Chandler, Because it’s flattering!  Come on Monica! Come on Monica! 
Rachel, Yeah actually  I think we’re gonna take off too. We rented a movie.
Phoebe, Oh! I won’t say  ‘no’ to a movie!
Rachel, Uh Pheebs  we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Phoebe, Shh! Get me out of here.
Rachel, Oh. 
Joey,  Ross!
Ross, What?
Joey, Come here  check this out!
Ross, What? Is it the comet? 
Joey, No! No-no. Look  there’s a bug stuck in tar right here. 
Ross, Joey come—I can’t believe—I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet  one of nature’s most spectacular phenomenon  and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!
Joey,  Y’know  there’s two women dude.
Ross, Show me where?
Joey, Right-right up here. 
Ross,  Joey where’s the pipe that was holding the door open?
Joey,  I don’t know!   Yeah  I do.
Ross, Joey!
Joey, What?! All right—Hey! Don’t look at me! You’re the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
Ross, It’s called the Bapstein-King comet  okay?  Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!
Joey,  Oh no! No! No! 
Chandler,  Monica!
Monica, She’s sleeping.
Chandler, I know  just quick-quick question  quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica, Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval  Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Chandler, Sorry  I just…can’t sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing  wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I’m like…
Monica, It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Chandler, What?!  Ow! 
Phoebe,  Please don’t be a space ship. Please don’t be a space ship.  Oh thank God!  How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…
Phoebe, Don’t interrupt me!!
Ross, Rachel!! Monica!!
Joey, Come on!
Ross, I can’t believe this!!
Joey, All right well  y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Ross,  Yeah  I guess we don’t have a choice.  Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!
Joey, Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. 
Ross,  I know  I wasn’t finished.   But don’t worry! We’re gonna go down the fire escape!!
Chandler, Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I’m sorry  I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
Monica, With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
Chandler, It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Monica, Here  let me make the milk  I’m up anyway.
Chandler, Hey  y’know what we can do? Y’know  now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long  y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!
Monica, Okay that does sound like fun.
Chandler, Okay  so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Monica, The second sister dies?!
Chandler,  No. No  I-I was  I was talking about the book I was reading.
Monica, The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Chandler, That’s correct.
Rachel, You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.
Rachel, Okay.  Oh wait! Umm  did you send those contracts to Milan?
Rachel, No seriously  y’know the contracts I gave you  did you overnight them?
Rachel, Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.
Rachel, Y’know  like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?  Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
Rachel," Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said  ""Must go out today "" and underlined today three times and  and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy."
Rachel, Y’know what Tag  if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
Rachel, Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Rachel, No! Come on its late  we’re not gonna go down to the office.
Rachel, Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!
Joey, All right  it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.
Ross, Ugh. Well  we’re just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now  we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice  okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh  and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So  when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Joey, Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Ross, Yeah! Oh yeah  you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh  just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
Joey, What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Ross, Well  I’m gonna lie to you Joey  it’s a possibility.
Joey,  I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what  let’s flip to see who does it  okay? You-you call it in the air  all right?
Ross, Oh  all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?
Joey, No.
Ross, Okay. Well  you be careful.
Joey, What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay  look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.
Ross, Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
Joey, Well all right so  it looks like we’re even!
Phoebe, Okay. So  this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here.  Okay so  to get the beeping to stop all I have to do…  Well done  Pheebs.   What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
Monica, Okay  here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about? 
Chandler,  What? What? What?
Monica, Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I’m sorry. Here. 
Rachel, Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess  Tag! I mean  this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh!  And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag  but whatever.
Rachel, Okay  very cute braces. Anyway y’know what  the point is Tag  start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk. 
Rachel," In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk  and then I put a Post-It on it  that said  ""Must go out today."" So you just keep looking in there! All right?"
Rachel, Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um  check the copy room  maybe you left the contracts in there?
Rachel, I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
Rachel, Thank you.  Hello?  I still don’t get it.
Monica, Are you still awake?
Chandler, Yeah! You?
Monica, You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as we’re both up…
Chandler,  Yeah?  I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Joey," Man  I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! ""Do you want soup or salad?"" Both! Always order both!"
Ross,  Y’know  y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window  crawl through  and-and y’know explain later.
Joey, Yeah? Really? No one’s home?
Ross, I don’t think so. Hello?  When you get in there… 
Phoebe, Okay  this is where you and I part ways.  Noisy bitch!
Monica, What?! What are you doing?!
Chandler, Do you know what just happened?
Monica, Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Chandler, No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
Monica, Nooo! No  that’s not true. No  best time ever! Yeah  you rocked me world! 
Chandler,  Monica?
Monica, What?!
Chandler, I was giving you some of my best moves  and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!

Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Give me the good stuff.
Chandler, Yeah!  No! No! No! Don’t fall asleep! Okay  I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Monica, Okay  I’m up! I’m up!
Rachel, Hi! I got you some coffee. To  uh…  …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
Rachel, Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Rachel, Well yeah  I wish that you would.  Well  no it’s not in there!  How about that drawer? 
Rachel,  Y’know  I don’t-I don’t know. Let me  let me check. 
Rachel, Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Rachel, You put these on my desk!
Rachel, Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer  crawled across the floor  then jumped on to my desk?! 
Rachel,  I am so hot for you right now.
Phoebe, Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe,  Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi  officer—fireman  can-can I help you?
Phoebe, That’s not mine.
Phoebe, How do you know?
Phoebe, Okay do you—Okay  do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Phoebe, Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Phoebe, There’s a reset button?! Ugh  thank you! Thank you!  There’s a reset button! My God! Why didn’t I see that!  Reset button  reset button  where is there a reset button?  Oh here it is!  Oh!  Ohh  God!

Ross, Okay  I’m going to start climb down you now.
Joey, All right! Just hurry up!
Ross, Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Joey, I think face to face.
Ross, I would say that.
Joey, Face to face  yeah!
Ross, Okay  here I go.
Joey, All right.
Joey,  Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross, I prefer not to answer that right now  I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Joey, Y’know  when we talked about face to face  I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
Ross, So what do you want me to do?
Joey, Well  just shimmy down me and drop!
Ross, Hi.
Joey, Hi.
Ross,  M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Joey,  Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross, It’s still looks pretty far!
Joey, It’s not that far! Just drop!
Ross, Do not rush me!!
Joey, Ross  you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!
Ross, Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I—Ooh  a quarter!
Monica, That really was some of your best work.
Chandler, Hm-hmm  I told you!  I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
Monica, I have to be up in seven minutes.
Chandler, Well  you’re not gonna believe this  but if you have seven minutes…
Monica, Really?!
Chandler, Do you wanna?
Monica, Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!
Joey, Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Joey, What are you doing?
Rachel, Well  y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Joey,  Why would you want to do that?
Rachel, So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Joey, Rach  there is a decent place to…
Rachel, And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
Joey, No. No. No.
Rachel, No?
Joey, No. Rosita does not move.
Rachel, I’m sorry  Rosita? As in…
Joey, As in Rosita does not move.
Rachel, Joey  it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
Joey, The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.
Rachel, Stevie the TV?
Joey,  Is there a problem?
Rachel, No!  Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita  us chichas got to stick together!  You bitch!
Ross," Hey  y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married  when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say  ""This is my brother-in-law Ross."" Not  ""My friend Ross "" ""brother-in-law Ross."" That’s weird isn’t it?"
Chandler," Couldn’t I just say  ""This is Ross?"""
Ross,  Sure  do whatever you want.
Monica,  Hey Ross! So  I was checking out the uh  real estate section…
Ross, Yeah?
Monica, Look at this. 
Ross, Oh  it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh  it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh  the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!
Phoebe, What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Monica, I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
Ross, I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!
Phoebe, I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
Ross,  Uh  hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes we’re surprised!  Who did you leave a message with?
Chandler,  Sorry! 
Rachel, Joey  Joey I am so sorry.
Joey, I told you not to move it! Rach  how would you feel if say  I wanted to move you mom  and you said don’t  and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Rachel, Okay  come on—Joey  I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.
Joey,  She’s not even cold yet!
Rachel, But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know  she did always put…your comfort first.
Joey, That’s true.
Rachel,  Okay? You ready?
Joey, Yeah  I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.
Ross, I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man  some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.
Monica, Well  after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you  it’s time the velvet ropes came down.
Ross, They kept your room for a while.
Monica, Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say  a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues  not a gym!
Ross, Come on  you know they love you.
Monica, As much as they love you?
Ross, I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.
Phoebe,  Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Ugh  I hate this year!
Ross, What’s wrong with this year?
Phoebe, Well okay  it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Monica, That was me and Ross.
Phoebe, Oh that’s right!
Ross, Hey  y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.
Monica, Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.
Phoebe, Yeah and yeah  and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know  I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much. 
Ross, What?
Phoebe, Oh yeah  like you never called!
Phoebe, Okay  I can do that! Oh  by the way  I love my office.
Phoebe, Oh okay. Umm  all right.  Hi  this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies  can I speak to your supply manager please?
Phoebe, Umm  okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Phoebe, Oh okay  well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you’re right  this is easy.
Phoebe, Oh well  all right…um  no offense  but you were kind of rude.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, No.  Oh wait yes! I do  I do have one question. What is toner?
Chandler, Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beer’s still cold. Something terrible must’ve happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie  I was never here! 
Ross, Dad?
Ross,  Hey!
Ross, Dad  we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.
Ross,  Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Monica, Oh  that’s okay  I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…
Monica, I used to love to play restaurant.
Ross, Yeah  not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Monica, Hey  it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies! 
Ross, Wow! Great!  Wait  dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?
Ross, Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey  check this out dad   Math  A. Science  A. History  A. Gym… Oooh  my rock polisher!
Ross, It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!
Ross, What?
Ross, How are you ever going to sell this place?
Ross, Oh no. Dad! Dad! What… Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad  she’s gonna be crushed!
Ross, No!
Phoebe,  Hi  this Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies  can I speak to your supply manager please?  Earl  thanks.  Hi Earl  this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies I’d like to talk to you about your toner needs. 
Phoebe, I’m hearing what you’re saying  but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Phoebe, May I ask why?
Phoebe, I surely do!
Phoebe,  Umm  is-is that because you’re out of toner?
Phoebe, No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Phoebe, Yeah! Now  why do you want to kill yourself?
Phoebe, Chandler?
Phoebe, No look  I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
Chandler, My chair. Now  if anybody asks  your name is Rosita! 
Rachel, You will like it!
Joey, No I won’t.
Rachel, You don’t even know!
Joey, Because  I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!
Rachel, Well look  if you don’t like this…
Joey, I don’t know why you say that so soon.
Rachel, Come on Joey  I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey  y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
Joey, Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey, Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Rachel, Joey  the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know  start the heeling process?
Joey, Well  I guess you’re right. Maybe  maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said  and kinda cool.  She’s heeled!
Rachel, That’s weird.
Joey, No it’s not weird  it’s a miracle!
Rachel, It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
Joey, Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure  wondrous things can happen!
Rachel, Joey  I really don’t…
Joey,  Can you tell me how this happened?
Rachel, Well no.
Joey, Miracle!
Rachel, No  y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
Joey, Someone like an…angel?
Rachel, That’s right Joey  the chair angel came in and heeled your chair. 
Joey,  Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! 
Ross, Dad that won’t matter to her. Look  all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is  is growing new stuff! See  this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Ross, Well  can you blame her?
Ross, Dad  dad I don’t want to hear about it.
Ross, Well  not right now. Okay look  Monica came here for some memories and damnit  we’re gonna give her some! Okay  grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.
Ross, Like uh y’know like this! This!  She-she could’ve made this!
Ross, Right? And this!  She-she could’ve won this!
Ross, Sure! Ooh-ooh  what about this?
Rachel,  I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!
Joey, Yeah  me too. 
Rachel, Hey  how’s…how’s the uh  miracle chair?
Joey, Fine.
Rachel, Yeah? Wow! Y’know  that this thing has speakers in the headrest!
Joey, No. Really?
Rachel, Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Joey,  My chair heels itself.
Phoebe, Earl  you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with! 
Phoebe, Wait  what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Phoebe, All right so Earl  let’s just forget about the people at the office  okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family  your friends  or maybe your girlfriend?
Phoebe, Oh sorry  boyfriend!
Phoebe, No  whatever! Anything!
Phoebe, Yeah  he’s gotta go.
Phoebe, No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!
Monica, Hey guys! Hey!
Ross, Hey.
Monica, Hey  I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats  they should be ready in about three days.
Ross,  Yeah! Yeah!  Oh  this will make a great memory.
Monica,  Okay. So  which boxes are mine?
Ross, Well  these. These are yours right here. 
Monica, Okay.  Oh! A coloring book! 
Ross, Yeah. Yeah  oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Monica,  Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Ross, Nu-uh! 
Monica,  Oh  an old glove?
Monica, Wow! Look at this!  I can’t believe I even fit into this shirt!   Oh  this is yours. 
Ross, Oh  I don’t know how that got in there.
Monica,  This isn’t mine.  Hey  this isn’t  this isn’t my stuff! Ugh  Ross!  These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?
Ross, Umm  your boxes are umm…
Monica, What?
Ross, Dad?
Monica, Just mine?
Monica, So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!
Monica, So wait  Ross’s stuff is fine  but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!
Monica, I can’t believe this! 
Rachel, Hey Chandler!
Chandler, Hey!
Rachel, How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines  has a rolling massage  and speakers in the head rest?
Chandler, Yeah  I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
Rachel, Well what if I told you  you can do it in my apartment?
Chandler,  Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
Rachel, I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. 
Chandler, That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
Rachel, Well  it’s a long story  but umm I broke Joey’s chair…
Chandler, Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
Rachel, Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!
Chandler, Well  what did you think  that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Rachel, Noo!  Angels.
Chandler, I’m gettin’ my chair back! 
Rachel, What? Wh-hey!
Joey, Well  it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So  I guess this chair is mine now! 
Chandler, Joey you broke my chair!!
Joey, Your chair?!
Rachel, Yeah  he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey, So  there was no miracle?!
Rachel, No Joe  no miracle.
Joey,  Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Rachel, Uh-huh! Nice try  but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!
Chandler, I think I should get the chair!
Joey, How do you figure?
Chandler, Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair  is me!
Rachel, No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.
Chandler, Well  where’s the logic in that?!
Rachel, The logic is  that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!
Chandler, So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Joey, That’s right!
Chandler, What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Joey, Yeah! We are!
Rachel, We’re the Cobras!
Phoebe,  Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.
Phoebe,  Earl! I’m Phoebe.
Phoebe, Umm  look it  you-you can’t kill yourself.
Phoebe, No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!
Phoebe, Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Phoebe, No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job  you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you  but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.
Phoebe, Yes.
Phoebe, I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Phoebe, No  it’s fate!
Phoebe, Oh. Well umm  okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.
Phoebe, Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this  okay? Your-your name is Earl  right? Her name was Pearl  P-Earl.
Phoebe, Sure!  Umm  where are you from?
Phoebe, Oh my God! So was she! Oh  I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps. 
Phoebe, Well  y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.
Phoebe, But if—no look  okay. These jerks might not care about you  but the universe does! And that says a lot!
Phoebe, Y’know  I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Hey! Guys!   Oh no  it’s you.
Monica, Oh  this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  It obviously meant enough for me to save it  and I don’t even know what it is! Ohh  it’s still soft.  What do you think this is?
Ross, All right. I think it was a mouse.
Monica, How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!
Monica,  What’s this?
Monica,  What?!
Ross,  What?!!!
Monica, Wait  you’re giving me your Porsche  you’re kidding me right?!
Ross, Well w-w-w-w-wait  w-wait  wait  wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Monica, All right!
Ross, Well  what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
Joey, Oh yeah.
Rachel, Ahhhh….
Joey, Ahhh……  Eh?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Monica,  Hey guys!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?
Rachel, Oh yeah  Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Monica, Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever! 
Ross, Happy birthday!!!
Monica, Happy birthday!!!
Monica, It’s your birthday!
Chandler,  She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Joey, They do!
Phoebe, Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica, Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Ross, We’ve got presents!
Rachel, Good ones?
Monica, They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel, Well  can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Joey, Come on Rach! Look  turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Ross, Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Joey,  Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! 
Rachel, Y’know  I’m still 29 in Guam.
Ross, Hey  30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Rachel, Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
Chandler, No Rach  it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
Joey,  And now Chandler! We’re all gettin’ so old!  Why are you doing this to us?! 
Monica, Rach  you’re in a great place in your life. Come on  you’ve got a great job! Good friends…
Joey, Yeah  you’re roommate is a soap opera star.
Rachel, Look  y’know I know my life’s going pretty well  but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.
Phoebe, Yeah  but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.
Rachel, There you go!
Phoebe, I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh  except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!!  And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean. 
Rachel, Thirty. Ugh  I mean thirty! Monica  do you remember mean  old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Rachel, Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.
Monica, Well  doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid  like Ross.
Ross, Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
Ross, How hot do I look in this  huh?!
Chandler, Ross  a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Ross, That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.
Joey, Hey  what’s the horsepower on this thing?
Ross,  I don’t know  but-but look how shiny!
Monica, I can’t believe you bought this.
Rachel, Really! God Ross  what were you thinking?  I know it’s really shallow  but a part of me wants him again.
Phoebe, Oh  well get in line missy.  So  can I have a ride stud?
Ross, Hop in.  Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Ross, Damnit! 
Phoebe,  Okay  who’s next?
Rachel, Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh  like my nose or my tongue or something.
Phoebe, Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
Rachel, So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!!
Rachel,  Get out  get out of my apartment.
Monica, All right Rach  for what it’s worth  I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it  no one handles this well.
Phoebe, Least of all you.
Monica, Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?
Chandler,  Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!
Joey, But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.
Chandler,  Okay  for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.
Chandler, Oh well  not as lovely as you. I mean  I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I can’t believe that you would have a tux that’s thirty years old! 
Chandler, Ohh! 
Rachel,  Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! 
Chandler,  Okay  everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.
Monica, Heyyy!! You got the door open!! 
Chandler, Hey-hey are you drunk?
Monica, Nooo!  Okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was  I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I wanna puke on you later!
Chandler, Okay  here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Monica, Noo!!!
Chandler, Yes!
Monica, Noo!!
Chandler, Yes!!
Monica, Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
Chandler, Okay  here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.
Monica, Really?! You promise?
Chandler, Yeah  I’ll take care of it.
Monica, Okay. I love you so much. 
Chandler,  Okay we have to do something about your breath.
Monica, What about your breath?! 
Chandler, That’s still yours. Okay  now remember it’s a surprise party. So  when you go in  act surprised.
Monica, Okay. I can do that.
Chandler, Okay.
Ross, Okay  forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay  back—Stop!  Okay  forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!
Monica, Ross  just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.
Joey, Well actually…
Ross, No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine. 
Joey, Dude  you soooo need this car.
Phoebe,  Okay. Okay  here’s what we’re gonna do. Okay  I’m gonna break into this mini-van and put it in neutral. You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot. Okay? All right  here we go.  Haul ass!!!! 
Phoebe, Happy thirtieth birthday! Here!  It’s for the child in you  and the woman. Happy thirtieth!
Phoebe, Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.
Phoebe, Wait! 
Phoebe, Yeah. What?!
Phoebe, Nu-uh!
Phoebe, You have your birth certificate?
Phoebe, Our mom.
Phoebe, Do you have my birth certificate?
Phoebe,  Oh my God! Oh my God  we are 31.
Phoebe, I just lost a whole year of my life.
Phoebe, Your middle name is Pamela?
Phoebe, Well  I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Phoebe, That’s my first name.
Chandler, Okay before we start the celebration  Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Monica, Yay!
Chandler, See?  Here we go. 
Monica,  Paul!
Chandler,  Phil.
Monica, Phil!
Chandler, Now  there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay   you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.
Phoebe, Hey  what’s going on?
Chandler, Monica’s a little drunk.
Phoebe, Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Monica, Awwwww… 
Chandler,  Go change!  She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.
Phoebe, Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do  I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
Rachel, What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
Chandler, Monica’s wasted.
Ross, Maybe that will liven up this party.
Chandler,  Okay  will you just go help her change please!
Rachel, Okay  but taking care of a drunk  naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Joey, Yep. 
Rachel, Ahh!
Rachel,  A scooter! 
Ross,  Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Rachel, No! No-no  I love it. Thank you. 
Chandler, Okay  open ours next. Open ours next!
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, Now that you’re a couple  we don’t get two presents from you guys?
Chandler, For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay  read the card! Read the card!
Rachel, Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  That’s funny  yeah!
Chandler, No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Rachel,  No  I know! I get it! It’s funny!
Chandler, No  because you’re not a grandmother!
Rachel, No I know  because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. 
Monica, All you had to do was buy the card!
Ross, Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?
Rachel, Well  I feel fine  but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
Ross, What? 
Rachel, Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…
Phoebe, Oh let me guess  and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
Rachel, As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
Phoebe, If you could do that  I’d marry the hippity-hop.
Rachel, So  if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35  I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait  but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…
Monica, Really! That long?!   Look all you want  it’s happening!
Rachel, No  so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years  that’s three whole years—Oh  wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding  and I’d like to know the guy for a year  year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.
Ross, Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!
Rachel, No! Ross  no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Joey, Will you quit hoggin’ it!
Rachel,  I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
Ross,  You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
Chandler,  Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go.
Joey,  Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Chandler,  How are you feeling?
Monica, You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here  right now! 
Ross, I really wish that you wouldn’t.
Chandler,  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more  okay? Then we can put you in bed  okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
Phoebe,  Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
Chandler, Pheebs!!
Phoebe, Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
Ross, Come on!
Chandler, I think it’s necessary. 
Monica, I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…
Phoebe,  Wooo!! Hoo!!
Monica, I really like to say that I’m-um…  Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!!  That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!!  And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And  and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. 
Phoebe,  Okay quick  help me get this off! 
Joey, Yeah!!
Phoebe, I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!
Joey, Oh  I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.
Phoebe, Will it? Will it?! I mean  how would you feel if you found out you were 31?
Joey, That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!
Phoebe, Plus  it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!
Joey, Like what?
Phoebe, Like okay I-I-I  I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I  I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!
Monica, Phoebe  y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
Phoebe, No  I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks. 
Rachel, Hey.  Oh  poor Pheebs.
Joey, Hey  y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home. 
Monica, Oh man!
Chandler, What?
Monica, He’s gonna eat the cake!
Joey, Pheebs! Wait up!  Listen uh  close your eyes.  Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.
Phoebe, Oh yeah.
Joey, Oh  and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.
Phoebe, Oh! 
Ross, Okay  is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork  okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!
Rachel, Ross  I really don’t think…
Ross,  Lift!! And slide!
Chandler, Okay  here we go.
Ross, All right everyone  lift!  And slide!! 
Rachel, Hey Joey  can I…
Joey, Oh  come on Rach! My turn just started!
Rachel, Actually  I just wanna talk to Tag.
Joey, Oh. Okay. Hey  can I ride this outside?
Rachel, Whatever! Okay  I’m not your mother.
Joey, Okay! 
Rachel, Not in the street!!
Joey, Yes!
Rachel,  Hi.
Rachel, Hey.
Rachel, Yeah  I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.
Rachel, Umm…
Rachel, Ohh Tag  umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…
Rachel, Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh  but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know  just have fun.
Rachel, Yeah  it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!
Rachel, Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually  if I’m wishin’ for stuff  I actually wish I was six years younger.
Rachel, Yeah  I’m sorry. 
Chandler, Hey! How’d it go?
Rachel, Oh  if I only want two kids  can I keep him for another year?
Phoebe, You did the right thing.
Joey,  I don’t like this anymore. 
Chandler, Well  here we are  just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Ross, God  do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
Joey,  Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?! 
Ross, Yes! My baby’s finally free!
Joey, All-all right!  Start it up! Let’s go!
Ross,  Woohoo!
Ross, You wanna buy a car?
Joey, No.
Monica, I’m glad you’re here  we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
Rachel,  Ohh…
Ross, What’s the matter? You okay?
Rachel, Yeah  it’s just y’know…
Chandler,  Monica said wedding.
Monica, Uh  so anyway  we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
Rachel, Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Chandler, Do you think you could get through a poem?
Rachel,  It’ll be a short one.
Monica, Okay  so Ross will be doing the reading.
Rachel, Ohhh…
Ross, Okay. Yeah  I guess  I guess I could do that too.
Chandler, Too?
Ross, Yeah  I kind of uh  have something else planned for you guys.
Monica, Do you mind telling us what it is?
Ross, Sorry  I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
Chandler, Well  whatever it is  I hope it involves winking. 
Joey,  Hey!
Joey, So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today  and…
Monica, What is DOOL?
Joey, Days Of Our Lives. Anyway  you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Chandler, That’s great!
Joey, And-and-and not only that  I’m gettin’ a new brain!!
Chandler, So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Rachel, Wait  what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
Joey, Oh well  they’re killing off one of the characters on the show  and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Ross, What? A brain transplant?!
Joey,  Yes  it’s a highly controversial procedure.
Ross, It’s ridiculous!
Joey, Well  I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.
Ross,  It’s winter  they are fewer people on the street. 
Monica, Who are they killing off?
Joey, Uh Cecilia Monroe  she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Monica, She’s my favorite character on DOOL.
Joey, Nice.
Rachel, She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces  I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
Monica, And the way she slaps all the time!
Rachel, Oh!
Monica, Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?! 
Chandler, Don’t do it.
Rachel, Cecilia Monroe man  what a great actress.
Joey, Oh  tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever  it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Ross," Yeah-yeah  help me out here  when you come out of the ""brain transplant "" you are going to be her?"
Joey, Yes  but in Drake Remoray’s body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Phoebe,  Rach  so  that guy there. Straight or gay?
Rachel,  Well  I'd have to say gay.
Phoebe, Yeah? Why?
Rachel, Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Phoebe, Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. 
Rachel, Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe,  Ohh knockers will help us figure it out. 
Rachel, All right  straight  and not subtle. 
Phoebe, Ohh  he left his cell phone.
Rachel, Oh  well  we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Phoebe, Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Rachel, What if  um  if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Phoebe, Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone. 
Rachel, What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
Phoebe, I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel, Phoebe  you had a date three days ago.
Phoebe, That wasn’t a date! That was  that was just friends getting together… having sex.
Rachel, Okay. Okay  see? I get the phone.
Phoebe, No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Rachel, Yeah!  And until now  I didn’t think I’d love again.
Phoebe, Nice try.
Rachel, Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe, I don’t know.
Rachel, Well umm  maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!
Phoebe, Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Joey, That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Joey, Oh anyway  I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Joey, Say what?
Joey, No. No  I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!
Joey, An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show  I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…
Joey,  I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?
Joey, Oh uh  one of the writers.
Joey, Umm…
Joey, Okay.
Joey, Ms. Monroe…  Oh there you go. 
Rachel, No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look  I have an idea. Why don’t we  why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial  and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
Phoebe, Or  we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Rachel, I don’t think so.
Phoebe,  Fine all right  but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
Rachel,  All right  first name on the speed dial is mom.
Phoebe, Ohh  I lost my mom to suicide.
Rachel, Okay no way  you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Phoebe, Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
Rachel, Yes okay.  Well now see this isn’t telling us anything.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!
Phoebe, Okay  a meat eater. Fine  that’s one for you.
Rachel,  Oh  I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.
Phoebe, So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house  or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
Rachel,  His new girlfriend!
Monica, What is that?
Chandler, I think it’s the dying cat parade.
Monica, It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.
Chandler,  Oh my God!
Monica, What?
Chandler," Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said  ""You’re half Scottish right?"""
Monica, Nooo!!
Chandler, Yes!!
Monica, No  there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
Chandler, Why is your family Ross?!
Monica, He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on  that is just noise! It’s not even a song!
Chandler, If you listen very carefully  I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hi!
Rachel, How are ya?
Phoebe, Good.
Rachel, Umm Pheebs  remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh  the cute guy’s cell phone?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Phoebe, Ooh  now you lost me.
Rachel, You stole the phone!
Phoebe, No I didn’t!
Rachel, No? So you’re saying that if I called it  it wouldn’t ring?
Phoebe, No.
Rachel, Umm  okay. But while you dial  let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh  it does work! 
Rachel, Phoebe!
Phoebe, That is a different phone.
Rachel, Oh is it?!  Uhh  hello?  Yes hi  is Rachel there?  Yes she is  just one moment please.  It’s for me!
Phoebe, That is damning evidence.
Rachel, Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Hello? Or should I be  Hi! It’s Rach…  Would you stop doing that?!
Phoebe,  Hello?  Yes  I’m the one who found your phone.
Rachel, Phoebe! You can’t do th…
Phoebe,  Shhh! I’m on a call!  Umm well yeah  you can pick it up tonight  say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It’s umm  it’s umm 5 Morton Street  Apartment 14  umm and then maybe y’know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.  Okay  well okay I’ll see you then.  Bye. 
Rachel, You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe, Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Rachel, You just said it!
Phoebe, Oh. Okay  well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Rachel, Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe, What?! That’s the first time today!
Rachel, Ohh! 
Joey, So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…
Joey, See you in 2003. 
Joey, I’m so sorry. Look  if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
Joey, No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
Joey, Joey.
Joey, Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I  that I came up to you before was because well  I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
Joey, Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!
Joey," Hey! Now  I’ve been watching some tapes  how’s this?  ""Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"""
Joey, Yeah.
Joey,  I can do an English accent?! That baby’s going on my resume!
Chandler, Well  I feel like a snack!
Monica, Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
Chandler, Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
Ross, What?!
Chandler, Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway  lots of bad memories. 
Ross, Oh well  it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh  rediscover its Scottish roots.
Monica, No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Ross, Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
Monica,  You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Ross, How did you know about that?!
Chandler, We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross, Were you the ones called the cops?!
Chandler, That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture  we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Ross, Why not?
Chandler, Because we hate them.
Ross, Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
Chandler, We have heard you play.
Ross, No  you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh  let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
Joey, Okay!  All right!
Joey, Okay. Okay. 
Joey, Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe  maybe uh  maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up  play different characters. You’re so talented.
Joey, Hey that’s not true! Look at uh  look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!
Joey, Like-like what?
Joey,  Wow!
Joey," Oh hey come on  don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm  look let-let me tell you something  okay? Now when I watch you do a scene  I’m thinking  ""Boy  she-she is a great actress!""  Uh but-but  I am also thinking  ""She is hot!"""
Joey, You own the room.  We should probably get-get uh…
Joey, Yeah-yeah  I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?
Joey, Yeah! Okay. 
Rachel, Hey! Hey!
Phoebe, Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Rachel, Well why shouldn’t I?!
Phoebe, Because it’s my apartment!
Rachel, Well  then I get to give him the cell phone.
Phoebe, Okay. All right.  Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Phoebe,  Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Rachel,  You’re not the man who left the cell phone.
Rachel, Is-is he coming? 
Phoebe, Could you-could you umm  give us one second?
Rachel, We’ll be right back sir.
Phoebe, Wh-what do we do?
Rachel, I don’t know!
Phoebe, Can you believe this?  We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Rachel, I know!  What?!
Phoebe, Hmm  they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
Rachel,  No-no they do but  you just have to wait.
Phoebe, Rachel  listen—I mean  if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
Rachel,  All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him  but you owe me; you owe me big!
Phoebe, Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
Rachel, Ohh…
Phoebe, Oh that’d be me. Sir.  After you.
Phoebe,  Nice!
Joey, Actually I rent the whole place and  I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Rachel, Hi.
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh  Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Rachel,  MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!! 
Joey, That uh  that is my roommate Rachel.
Joey,  Sure. Yep.
Monica,  Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God  can I just ask you to do me oh  just one favor?
Monica, Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! 
Rachel, God. You seem really  really nice.
Joey, Okay  bye-bye.
Rachel, I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Joey, All right  here we go. 
Rachel, Okay.
Monica,  Oh wait  just one more thing! One more minute!  Umm  you’re a stupid bitch.
Rachel, You are so beautiful.
Monica, Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
Joey, Thanks for stopping by. See ya!   I-I am so sorry. I…
Joey,  Oh my God!
Joey, They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
Joey, Well no  I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines!  Oh…
Joey,  Ew  you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Joey, Yeah well  I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.
Ross, …now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
Rachel,   I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Ross,  Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Rachel, No!
Ross,  Now umm  remember I’m still learning.
Ross, One  two  three  four!
Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
Ross, So?
Joey,  I don’t think so.
Joey, Oh noo…
Joey, Thanks!
Joey, Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Joey, The airport?
Joey, Ohh. Wow! Well how-how  how will you be gone?
Joey, That’s a really long time.
Joey, Well I tell ya  I should probably buy a place in the city first.  And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya  that is a tricky one!
Joey, Good luck.
Ross, You know the song! Sing along!
Phoebe, Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi! Hi Ben!
Ross, Hi  we have a little bathroom emergency.
Rachel, Oh  yeah go ahead.
Ross, Uh  before we do uh  are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?
Rachel, No. No.
Ross,  Okay! All clear!
Rachel, Ben  its Rachel!  But whatever.
Ross,  Everything okay in there?
Rachel, Awww  just like his daddy.
Ross, Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?
Rachel, What-what about Monica?
Ross, Oh  she isn’t home.
Rachel,  So it would just be  me alone?
Ross, Well  Ben would be there.
Rachel, Huh umm…
Ross, What’s the matter?
Rachel, Well that—y’know it’s just uh  I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.
Ross, Rach  he’s not an ex-con.
Rachel, Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh  what do I  what do I do with him?
Ross, I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right  I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?
Rachel, Yeah I think so.
Ross,  I wasn’t talking to you.
Ross, Okay  I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.
Rachel, Bye.  Ahhh…  So this is fun  huh?
Rachel, Okay. Uh  want something-want something to drink?
Rachel, Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Rachel, Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita? 
Rachel, Water it is.
Monica, What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.
Chandler, You mean the spitter?
Monica, Come on! It wasn’t that bad!
Chandler, Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
Monica, All right  what about the third guy?
Chandler, You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Monica, Can you blame him?
Chandler," Sorry  I just don’t like the idea of when I say  ""I do "" he’s thinking  ""Yeah  I’d do her too!"""
Monica, Well then we still have a problem.
Chandler, Yeah!
Phoebe,  With what?
Monica, Well  we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know  can’t stop staring at the ladies. 
Phoebe, Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Monica, Phoebe  we’re getting married  married; not sixth grade married.
Phoebe, No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Monica, Are you serious?
Phoebe, Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
Joey, I call it!!
Phoebe, What?! No! It was my idea!
Chandler, Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Joey, Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Chandler, We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean  gay and in control of his saliva!
Rachel, Ben y’know when uh  when you were a baby  you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was  I was your daddy’s girlfriend.
Rachel, No  I’m not.
Rachel, Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas  okay?
Rachel,  Fifty-two minutes.  So no-no brothers and sisters  huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.
Rachel, Oh  you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.
Rachel, Well y’know  we would umm  repeat everything the other said  or uh  we’d jump out of closets to scare each other  or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.
Rachel, Yeah? You like that one?
Rachel, I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey  I’ve got a ton of these! Umm  oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm  you uh  you take a quarter  take a quarter and  and you blacken the edge. Right?  And then you say to person  I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it  they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Rachel, Yeah  I-I-I-I’m funny Ben  but I’m not stupid. Okay?
Joey, So  did you uh  find anyone to marry you guys yet?
Chandler, No  but Horny for Monica Minister called  wanting to know if we were still together.
Monica, We’re never gonna find anybody.
Joey, Well then let me do it!
Chandler, Joe…
Joey, No-no-no! Look  I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.
Monica, Joey look it’s really sweet…
Joey, No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit  and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!
Monica, That is true.
Joey, Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like  stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus  y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.
Chandler,  Y’know  we haven’t found anybody else.
Monica, It might be kinda cool.
Joey, So I can do it?
Chandler, Yeah you can do it.
Joey, All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay  I gotta get started on my speech! Oh  wait a minute  Internet ministers can still have sex right?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Okay.
Monica, Hey Pheebs  how’s it going?
Phoebe, Oh  I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Monica, Oh  I’m sorry. Can I get you something?
Phoebe, Oh my God  you’ve got to stop chattering!
Monica, Here  take a couple of these. 
Phoebe, What is it?
Monica, It’s Hexadrin.
Phoebe, Oh no  I don’t believe in Western medicine. No  if you just apply pressure to these points right here.  Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache  so thanks. 
Monica, Okay  while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in  I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on.  Get some nice soft pillows under your head  I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down——gonna make you some tea. And then  I’m gonna rub your feet.
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, Oh! My head! Oh!  Oh!
Rachel, Coming.
Ross, I have a bone to pick with you.
Rachel, Uh-oh.
Ross, Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Rachel, Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… 
Ross, That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Rachel, Oh that.
Ross, Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
Rachel, Oh  come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat  you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!
Ross, I was barefoot. Now tell me  the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
Rachel,  Yes.
Phoebe, It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?
Monica, Hexadrin. 
Phoebe, Oh  I love you Hexadrin!  Oh look! It comes with a story! 
Monica, No Phoebe  those are like the side affects and stuff.
Phoebe, Say what?
Monica, Y’know  the possible side affects.
Phoebe, Oh my God!  Dizziness  nervousness  drowsiness  facial swelling  nausea  headache—Headache. Vomiting  stomach bleeding  liver damage! Now okay  I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry  extra strength death capsules!
Monica, Phoebe  relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Phoebe, Why?
Monica, In case it happens.
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! 
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, You did it! You got ordained?!
Joey, Yeah  I just got off the Internet! Man  there is a lot of porn out there!
Chandler, Our minister…
Phoebe, I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! 
Monica, Phoebe  your liver is right here. 
Phoebe, Okay  then I must be disoriented.
Joey, Anyway  I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony  do you wanna hear it?
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Yeah!
Joey," Now-now  listen this is just a first draft so…  ""We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.""  Eh?  ""It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.""  ""We too can share and love and have and receive."""
Chandler,  Should we call the spitter?
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel," Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself  ""What’s up with Carol and sweet  little Ben?"""
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, I’d love that. I would loooove…  So uh  so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Rachel, I found him!  Very funny  come here!  That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?
Rachel, Yes oh——Do I want sugar in my coffee?  No  just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks.  Okay  do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rachel, Don’t do that.
Rachel, Seriously  your dad doesn’t like pranks.
Rachel, Oh damnit!
Rachel, No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!
Rachel, No don’t! Go back to repeating!
Rachel, Oh crap!
Phoebe, I feel like my face is swelling.  Is my face swelling?
Monica, Phoebe  your face is fine! Come on  none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Phoebe, Oh  interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! 
Joey, Okay you guys  I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Chandler, Yeah. O-okay.
Joey,"  ""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share  I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…"" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. "
Monica, How about receiving?
Joey, Yes!
Chandler, See Joe  not that that’s not grrreat! But  one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know  it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!
Joey, Ooh  like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?
Chandler, No  not us…  Us! 
Monica, I gotcha. Sorry.  So  did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?
Phoebe, Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?
Monica, It doesn’t say that!
Phoebe, Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!
Chandler, See Joe  we want you to tell stories but y’know  romantic stories. Nice stories.
Joey," Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay  maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only  only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say  ""Began their beautiful journey…"""
Monica, There you go!
Joey," ""…by doin’ it."""
Chandler, Joe?
Joey, Okay. All right. Umm  so uh  so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?
Chandler, Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?
Joey, Yeah!! I call that London style.
Monica, No that is not what happened with us. Well  I was umm  I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.
Joey, Oh.
Monica, And then Chandler was  was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…
Joey, Yeah baby!
Chandler, And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Joey, Oh.
Chandler, But then later that night…
Joey, Yeah baby!
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica,  Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?
Chandler, Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after… 9:15.
Monica,  Is Joey here?
Chandler, Well  last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh  you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Monica, Wouldn’t you be?
Chandler, Well  look it’s been a really emotional time y’know  and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Monica, Really?
Chandler, You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica, Well  not anymore.
Chandler, But we don’t do that.
Monica, I know  I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler, How drunk are you?
Monica, Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler,  That’s the perfect amount!
Monica, Okay!
Monica,  Y’know what’s weird?
Chandler, What?
Monica, This doesn’t feel weird!
Chandler, I know.
Monica, You’re a really good kisser.
Chandler, Well  I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?
Monica, Hm-hmm!
Chandler, Okay!
Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica, We’re gonna see each other naked.
Chandler, Yep!
Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler, Count of three?
Monica, One!
Chandler, Two!
Monica, Two!
Chandler, Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica, Eh  we weren’t that close anyway!
Chandler, Eh!
Chandler, Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! 
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e… 
Joey, Oh  dude I’m so sorry!
Chandler, No! No! No!
Joey, Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second  I’m still with my bride’s maid  I just—Where are those condoms you brought?
Chandler, They’re in my bag over there. 
Joey, Ah. 
Chandler, Uh  could you leave me one?
Joey,  For just you?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Hey listen  why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.
Chandler, No I-I-I’m fine.
Joey, All right  here you go buddy.  Go nuts. 
Joey, That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something  but it did nothing for me.
Monica, Okay  can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.
Joey, Oh…  Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!
Phoebe, Yeah  it’s totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
Monica, What?!
Chandler, What?
Phoebe,  What?!
Chandler, Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Monica, Okay  fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So  when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey. 
Joey, Yeah baby!  No baby!
Chandler,  So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
Monica, No because it-it didn’t seem important.
Chandler, Oh  it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!
Monica, Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Joey, And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—
Chandler, I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.
Monica, Chandler  please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Joey, Hey!  Now I’m a man of the cloth  but I still have feelings!
Chandler,  Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?
Joey, What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?!  I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this  all right? Look  everything worked out okay!
Chandler, Okay  it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.
Monica, Wait Chandler come on  let’s—it’s not a big deal!
Chandler, It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman  and instead you had to settle for Robin. 
Joey, This is crazy.
Phoebe, I know! Robin is so gay!
Rachel, So now what have we agreed?
Rachel, And-and what else?
Rachel, Very good.
Ross, Rachel! What are you doing here?
Rachel, I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.
Ross, Your good friend?
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, What’s her last name?
Rachel, Carol…Lesbian?
Ross, Nice. And by the way that uh  that line down my face?
Rachel, What line?
Ross," Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh   ""Dude  don’t you ever was your face?"""
Rachel, All right  I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!
Ross, Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
Ross, Hi.
Ross, Practical jokes.
Ross, You have a line down your face.
Rachel, Okay  maybe they are not funny to you…
Rachel, Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!
Ross, Uh  y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
Rachel," That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout  ""I will be revenged?!"""
Ross, I will be! Listen  I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Rachel, Fine. Fine  but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!
Ross, No that’s not what I want. Uh  I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
Rachel, Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters  somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!
Rachel, I gotta go! 
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Joey, Chandler  come on nothing even happened!
Chandler, Look Joe  I know you wanted to do the wedding…
Joey, No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it  I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.
Chandler, How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Joey, Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler  she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did  ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know  we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.
Chandler, That’s what you should say.
Joey, What?
Chandler, When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
Joey, Really? I can do it?
Chandler, I’d love it if you would do it.
Joey, Hey! 
Chandler, But those are the words! Those exact words!
Joey, Well I don’t know remember exactly but  it’s-it’s pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Ross, Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh  is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh  ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel  so…
Rachel, Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun  don’t we Ben? 
Ross, Okay  I’ll see you later pal.
Rachel, Ohh  okay.  Wh—Ah-ha!  Wait a minute. Uh Ben  I can’t do it.
Ross, What?
Rachel, I can’t let him go out that way  he’s got a meeting.  You’ve got something here on your back.
Ross, What?  That’s great. That is great.  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!
Rachel, Oh I…
Ross, All right  that’s it!  Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!
Rachel, No! Wait! Come on!
Ross, Wait! No! Ben  come here! I am not kidding!
Rachel, No you guys… 
Ross, I-I-am—
Rachel, EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!! 
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Hey-hey.
Joey, So are guys doing okay?
Chandler, Yeah  we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Monica, Yeah baby! 
Phoebe, I’m really glad you guys are okay but  I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.
Monica, Honey! Dinner’s ready!
Monica, Your favorite!
Joey, Ho-ho-ho   fried stuff with cheese!
Monica, Yep! And lot’s of it!
Monica, Okay  in we go.
Joey, Here you go.
Phoebe,  Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill!  That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Joey, Good for you!
Phoebe, Oh  it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look   no hair loss  not a rash  no hives  I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath  no temporary euphoria—Oh.
Monica, So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.
Joey, Food? Uh-huh gimme! 
Chandler, So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
Phoebe, Since when are you into swing music?
Chandler, Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Monica, Chandler.
Chandler, Gap commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call?
Monica, I will.
Chandler, Do you want me to call?
Monica, No  I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.
Phoebe, What is your job?
Chandler, Staying out of the way.
Joey, This is impossible Monica  why don’t you just pick all 15? 
Monica, There were only twelve.
Joey, Oh yeah  I added three.
Monica, What are peanut butter fingers?!
Joey, Oh yeah… 
Ross,  Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh  go try to talk to her?
Chandler, Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Ross, Uh yeah! Let me  let me get that for you.
Ross,  I got it.   So hi  I’m uh  I’m Ross and this is my friend Chandler. 
Ross, Kristen  hi. Are you uh  new to the area  ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.
Ross, Ah.
Ross, Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh  this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah  sometimes ankle deep! 
Chandler,  Smooth.
Ross, Umm  say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Great! Uh  let me take this up for you. 
Ross, Oh no-no  after you.   Oh my God! 
Phoebe,  Am I crazy or does this totally go?!
Rachel, Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Phoebe,  Thank you Rachel but  look at Monica!
Monica, This is it. Yeah  this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!
Monica, Well I’m Monica Geller  ball like a baby.
Monica, Have you found your dress yet?
Monica, No  I can’t afford this either. No. I-I-I’m  I’m just to figure out which one I want then I’m gonna get it at Kleinman’s  this discount place in Brooklyn  day after tomorrow they are having a huge sale.
Monica, Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Rachel, I do the same thing.
Rachel, I’m just kidding too.  I’m getting married in December. 
Monica, Oh May 15th.
Monica, Yeah!
Monica, Jeffery.
Monica, The best man? Wow!
Monica, Oh  my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
Phoebe, Ooh  is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!
Rachel, Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Rachel, So  does this  come in another color or… 
Joey,  Hi! You uh  movin’ in or movin’ out?
Joey, Oh uh  can I give you a hand?
Joey, Boyfriend?
Joey, I’m Joey.

Joey, Oh.
Joey, Sounds great! Okay all right  well where does this go? 
Joey, Okay. Yeah.  Yeah  I’ll grab this one. 
Rachel,  So this is Brooklyn.
Monica, All right  listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors  fan out. Now  this is what you’re looking for!  Memorize it! When you locate the dress  blow on these. All right?  Three short blasts  when you hear it. Come running.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Got it.
Monica, All right.
Rachel, Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
Monica,  Hey! Don’t be a baby!
Rachel, Well I…
Phoebe,  Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Monica, No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it.   Don’t crowd me!  This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God  it’s perfect!  I’m sorry  this one’s taken!  Whoa!
Monica, Megan!
Monica, You came?!
Monica, This is my dress!
Monica, Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!
Monica, What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!
Monica, Maybe I do! I’m pretty feisty! 
Phoebe,  I’m coming! I’m coming! 
Phoebe, Okay!  Hey!  What do I do?!!  What are you doing?  Did you find the dress? 
Phoebe, Did you find the dress?
Rachel, No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
Phoebe, I—We gotta get Monica. 
Rachel, No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Phoebe, Oh my God!!  Excuse me! Excuse me! 
Monica,  Go! Go! Go!
Rachel,  Hey…
Monica, NOW!!!!!!!! 
Chandler, So Ross  how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Ross, Laugh all you want but uh  she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
Chandler, Huh.
Ross, Yeah in fact  I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… 
Joey,  Hey Chandler!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Listen  sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.
Chandler, Uh Joe  when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!
Joey, Well check it out  I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Chandler, Really? Right across the street?
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, When’d you meet her?
Joey, Two days ago.
Chandler, Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!
Joey, Oh yeah?
Ross,  Hey.
Chandler, Hi! How’d it go?
Ross, Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
Chandler,  Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?
Joey, Well  I sorta am. I mean yeah  I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But  I don’t know  I’m not to worried about it.
Ross, Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
Chandler, So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go  believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh  by the way  what’s the name the girl you’re dating?
Chandler, Bye! 
Ross, Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey, Obviously! So  how do we decide?
Ross, Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively  I think I should date her…
Joey,  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or  or I’m the one who dates her.
Ross, That’s interesting  but check this out. I date her…
Joey, Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
Ross, Okay  okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey, Yeah well we should order some food then.
Ross, No Joey! Look why don’t  why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey  we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.
Joey,  That sounds fair.
Ross, Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…
Joey, Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Ross, Well sorry  that’s what I do on dates.
Joey, All right  well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
Ross, So let’s decide on the spending limit…
Joey, Yeah. Uh  …a slice……six dollars?
Ross, I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey, Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Monica, Oh…
Phoebe, I know. Hand me a tissue. 
Rachel, You’re out of Diet Coke.
Monica, Hello?  What?!  You what?!  Hey you listen here missy!  Wh—
Phoebe, What?!
Monica, That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Phoebe,  Does that mean Carcass is available?
Monica, What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Phoebe, Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
Monica, How?
Rachel, You’re out of toilet paper!
Joey,  Hey!
Ross, Hey! What’s up?
Joey, I just wanted to come by and y’know  wish you good luck on your date.
Ross, Oh thanks!
Joey, Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
Ross, We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Joey, Wow  that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.
Ross, I am dressed.
Joey, Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
Ross, I have an oily T-zone!
Joey, Okay dude!  Hey you uh  you sent Kristen flowers.
Ross, That’s right.
Joey, You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!
Ross, Uh actually  I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally  technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Joey, Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!
Ross, Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
Joey, I don’t know.
Ross, Why am I not surprised?
Joey, Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!
Ross, I don’t think you have much choice.
Joey, Well we’ll see!
Ross, Bye-bye!
Joey, Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
Ross, Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
Chandler, Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! 
Phoebe, Yeah  swing music is so out.
Monica, Phoebe  he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.
Chandler,  What are you guys talking about?
Monica, Well umm  we were just talking about the y’know  the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know  they were the right way to go.
Rachel, Yeah  I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh  two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know  but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
Chandler, But I love swing music!
Phoebe, Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
Chandler, Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them  we had fun! And there’s another reason too.
Rachel, Well  what is the other reason?
Chandler, I don’t want to say.
Rachel, Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
Chandler, Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Monica, Oh crap!
Ross, So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
Joey,  Kristen?
Joey, Hi!
Joey, Oh I like this place. And technically  technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…
Joey, Hi!
Ross, Hi.  It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.
Ross, Yeah. So…
Joey, Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! 
Ross, So Joey umm  you look familiar. Are uh  are you on TV or something?
Ross, That’s right! That’s right  don’t you play a woman?
Joey, A woman in a man’s body.
Ross, Much better.
Joey, So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause  you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Ross, Well yes  yes I have. In fact umm  just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.
Ross, That’s right! Wait no  Ben.
Joey, So you’ve just married the one time then?
Ross, Well umm…
Ross, Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey  have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
Joey,  Yeah. So uh Ross  well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
Joey, No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Ross, Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Joey, Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Ross, Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Joey, Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Ross, Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
Joey, Monkey lover!
Joey, When do you think we lost her?
Ross, Probably around gonorrhea.
Chandler, Hi  honey! I’m home!
Monica,  Don’t come in here!
Chandler, Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica, No! We only mess around at his place!
Chandler, Y’know it’s funny I started it but  now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?
Monica, No  I’m wearing a wedding dress.
Chandler, Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!
Monica, Yeah but I’m not keeping it.
Chandler, Well then why can’t I see it?
Monica, Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it  so you can’t like it.
Chandler, Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it.  Wow! You-you look…hideous.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yeah  that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Monica, Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way  I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Chandler, Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Monica, Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well  maybe a little.
Chandler, Okay!
Monica,  Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding?  Guys?
Chandler,  I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
Monica, All right? What’s going on?
Monica, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone. 
Ross, Yeah  laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
Joey, Yeah!  Y’know  she could use a little…  Oh nice shot!!! 
Joey, Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…
Phoebe, Oh my God!  I’m sorry  too soon. You go.
Joey, Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Monica, Joey!
Phoebe, Good for you!
Monica, Congratulations! Wow! I can’t believe you’re nominated for an Emmy!
Joey, No-no.
Monica, Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
Joey, No! I’m up for a Soapie!
Monica, Honey? Is that something you’re making up?
Joey, No  no  no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998.  Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!
Rachel,  Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Joey, Thank you! Well  I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards. 
Rachel, Oh  stop that! Don’t kid about that!  Will all the stars be there?
Joey, Many are scheduled to appear.
Rachel, Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
Monica,  Okay  I’ll go!
Rachel, No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
Ross, …and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator.  Yes Mr. Lewis?
Ross, Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
Ross, Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Of course  this is just conjecture. Okay  that’s uh  that’s all for today.  Uh Mr. Morse  can I see you for a moment?
Ross, Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam  I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.
Ross, Well you need 60% to pass…
Ross, Seven.
Ross, No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?
Ross, Well I’m sorry but  that-that’s really not my problem.
Ross, Well that brings me in the loop a little.
Ross, Okay!  Umm  I uh  I’m your teacher. I’m sorry  you’re-you’re a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Phoebe, Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Monica, Really?  My God  he’s really cute.
Phoebe, Go for it.
Monica, Phoebe  I’m engaged!
Phoebe, I’m just saying  get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Monica, Op  can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm  I’m engaged. 
Monica, Well you should be embarrassed. 
Phoebe, I did  but that was really fun.
Joey,  And the winner is…Joey Tribbiani!  Oh… Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh  I didn’t prepare a speech. But umm  I’d like to thank  my parents  who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends  Chandler  Monica  Phoebe  Rachel…
Rachel, I’m fourth!  Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Joey, Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.
Rachel, What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too  with my shampoo bottle.
Joey, Really?
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, What award are you practicing for?
Rachel, Grammy  Best New Artist.
Joey, Oh  hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.
Rachel, Ohh that’s great!
Joey, Yeah!
Rachel, So you’ll definitely get onstage  even if you don’t win.
Joey,  What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?
Rachel, Well of course I do! But y’know  favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Joey, Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win  but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
Rachel, Well Joey  you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like… 
Joey, Hey! 
Rachel, Y’know?
Joey, You practice losing the Grammies too?
Rachel, Oh no  at the Grammies I always win.
Joey, Ah.
Phoebe, Oh hey!
Monica, Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
Phoebe, Oh  great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know  he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck. 
Monica, Okay  stop it Phoebe  you’re getting me all tingly.
Phoebe,"  All I could think of was y’know  ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"""
Monica, And did he?
Phoebe, I’m a lady Monica  I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself. 
Monica, Okay-okay  I got it. I got it.
Phoebe, I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.
Monica, Oh  I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow  I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?
Phoebe, You sound like a guy.
Monica," No  a guy would be saying  ""I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."" Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean  I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again."
Phoebe, You’ll have a last kiss.
Ross, Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Joey, Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
Ross, There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.
Joey, Whoa!
Rachel,  Whoa what?
Joey, Ross has a boyfriend.
Ross, I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
Rachel, Really?
Ross, Yeah! I don’t know. I mean  last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe? 
Rachel, Not right now.
Ross, It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Rachel, Oh  see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on  you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.
Ross, Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, How’d you get over that teacher?
Rachel, I didn’t. I got under him.
Joey,  Problem solved.
Phoebe, Okay bye. 
Phoebe, Bye!  We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Monica, Phoebe  it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm  y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…
Phoebe,  I miss you too!!!! 
Monica, See? That’s what I mean. I mean that  that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life  and that’s what makes me happy.  Hey sweetie  come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?
Chandler, Oh totally!  Pull my finger.
Joey,  This is it! This is my category.
Rachel, I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Joey, Yeah  I got my speech!
Rachel, Do you got your gracious loser face?
Joey, Yeah. 
Rachel, Now Joey remember  if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Joey, Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?
Rachel, On TV?! Yeah!
Joey, ‘Kay!
Joey, What the?! 
Joey,  Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can.  The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff.  From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop   from All My Children Sarah Mchann  and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is……Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.  Uh  unfortunately Jessica couldn’t be with us tonight so I’ll be accepting this award on her behalf.  And I’m sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She’d also like to thank my friends  Chandler  Monica  Ross  Phoebe  and Rachel who’s sittin’ right there!  
Rachel, Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
Joey, Rach we had to get out of there because  look what I won! 
Rachel, Oh my God you stole her award!
Joey, No-no! No  I’m accepting it on her behalf. 
Rachel, Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.
Joey," Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in  ""I behalfin’ it!"""
Rachel, Joey  you have got to take this back!
Joey, But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
Rachel,  No! Joey!
Joey, Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.
Rachel, Do you really want an award you didn’t win?
Joey, No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach  if-if I put it up there  right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.
Rachel, Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
Joey, I can scratch that right off.
Rachel, Joey no  this is wrong! You have to take it back  okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Joey, All right!
Rachel, All right?  Thank you.
Joey, I’ll take it back tomorrow.
Rachel, Thank you.
Joey,  If I can’t have it you can’t have it! 
Ross,  Yes Mr. Lewis  how can I help you?
Ross, And why exactly would I do that? 
Ross,  What?!
Ross, No!
Ross, Well that’s different! Okay? Because he  he was actually in love with me!
Ross, What?
Ross, I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
Monica, Have you seen Chandler?
Phoebe, No. Why?
Monica, ‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.
Phoebe, Okay  don’t sweat it.  Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy’s cute. 
Monica, Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
Phoebe, No that is the last thing you want to do!
Monica, Why?
Phoebe, Because you’re marrying him!
Monica, You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
Phoebe, All right  I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married  but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship  do not communicate them to your husband.
Monica, So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?
Phoebe, That is correct! Yes  you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Monica, Your mother told you this?
Phoebe, Yes!
Monica, The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Phoebe, Oh my God! You’re right! Go!  Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it’s too late! Wait no!  Does this also mean putting out doesn’t get you love? 
Rachel, I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
Joey, Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Rachel, Okay  I’m totally cool! 
Joey, Hey Jessica.
Rachel,  Hey Jess.
Joey, Ah  this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, ‘Sup? 
Joey, Uh listen  here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya. 
Joey, Well  that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna  you’re gonna put it on your self or anything?
Joey,  Take it back?
Rachel, Absolutely.
Joey, Y-y-yeah!  Yeah you do. 
Monica, Honey  as we get closer to the wedding  is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
Chandler, Okay. Well  I think the centerpieces are too big
Monica, You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
Chandler, Kinda. They’re really big.
Monica, Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?
Chandler, What?
Monica, Just  I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?
Chandler, No. No  see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic  anxiety  and a great deal of sweating.
Monica, Okay  but all right you’re a guy  does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Chandler, Sleeping with somebody new  anxiety  panic  and I’m afraid even more sweating.
Monica, Even with me?
Chandler, I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look  for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts  I’m back to panic  anxiety  and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Monica, Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No  besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…
Chandler,  Water! Water! Water!
Ross, Uh Mr. Morse  can I speak to you for a moment?
Ross, Uh-hmm  yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.
Ross, ‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.
Ross, Y’know what? I-I’m not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay——Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don’t love me and you never did!  Ah Professor Winston  Professor Fredrickson  I’ll be right with you.  Don’t make this worse and I’ll give you a C.  Shall we? 
Phoebe, Rach?
Rachel, I’ll be out in a second.
Phoebe, Oh.  It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…
Rachel,  Honey  we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
Phoebe, …in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.  Thank-thank you Neil. Thank you for the words. 
Rachel, Okay honey  you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.
Phoebe, Please  don’t play the music. Just uh one more. LIVE FROM NEW YORK! IT’S SATURDAY NIGHT!!
Phoebe,  Oh hey! How was your audition?
Joey, I’m sorry  do I know you?
Phoebe, What are you doing?
Joey, Nothing  I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!
Phoebe, Oh! You got it?!
Joey, Well  no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Monica, What was it for?
Joey, Oh  it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh  and the director is supposed to be the next  next Martin Scorcese.
Phoebe, The next  next?
Joey, Yeah  there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese  all right? But then this guy’s right after him.  Hello!
Joey,  They loved me!
Joey,  Oh my God!
Joey, Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!  Oh.  Uh  okay uh let me call you back. 
Phoebe, What’s the matter?
Joey, They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Monica, Wow!
Joey, I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!
Phoebe, Grandma’s gonna have to get in line.
Phoebe, Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Monica, Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Ross, A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Monica, Hey Phoebe  will you give me a hand?
Phoebe, Sure.
Monica, I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey  Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Ross, Cassie?
Monica, Uh-hmm.
Ross, Wow  I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Monica, Ross  she’s 25 years old.
Ross, So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey Pheebs  can I talk to you over here for a second?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Monica, Subtle guys!
Phoebe, What?!
Monica, I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
Rachel,  Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!
Monica, Okay. Sorry. 
Rachel,  Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Monica, Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Joey, I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious  legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
Monica, That’s what you say about porn.
Joey, You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
Monica, No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Joey, Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
Monica, Plus  everyone’s gonna see your thing. 
Phoebe, Well when can we have this shower?
Rachel, She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…
Phoebe, Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?
Rachel, Yesterday!
Phoebe, Well if we make it yesterday  woo-hoo! We’re done!
Rachel, Oh my God Phoebe  this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Phoebe, Rachel  calm down!
Rachel,  Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right  you’re right.
Phoebe,  Just calm down woman!
Rachel, Phoebe  I already  I already did.
Phoebe, Oh okay. All right  then I need to calm down a little.
Rachel, Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right  where are we gonna have it?
Phoebe, Uh  here. What time?
Rachel, 4 o’clock. Food?
Phoebe, Finger sandwiches and tea.
Rachel, Ooh great! Very Monica.
Phoebe, And chili!
Rachel, Ah you went one too far. Uh  flowers or balloons?
Phoebe, Both!
Rachel, We’re paying for this y’know.
Phoebe, Neither.
Rachel, Okay. Umm  what should we do for the theme?
Phoebe, Lusts of the flesh.
Rachel,  What?
Phoebe, I don’t know.  A cowboy theme?
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Monica, Oh boy me too!
Chandler, Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
Monica, Yeah?
Chandler, Technically we could have sex again. What do you think  bossy and domineering?!
Monica, The wedding is off  sloppy and immature!
Chandler, That’s me! Come on!
Monica, Okay.  But wait  we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room  we’re supposed to have lunch.
Chandler, Well get rid of her  obsessive and shrill.
Monica, Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Chandler,  Hi! Nice to meet you!
Monica, So  are you ready to go?
Monica,  Chandler!
Chandler, I’ll be right with you.
Monica,  Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Ross, What—why?
Monica, Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.
Ross, What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
Chandler, I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.
Monica, You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Ross, Fine  she can stay at my place. By the way  what-what does Cassie even look like now.
Monica, She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler, Umm  so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Monica, Wafer thin ice!
Joey, Hey  I’m back!
Joey, Uh so  will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Joey, Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part  but whatever! Y’know  thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! 
Joey, And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
Joey, Wow! Sure! That’s great!
Joey, Yeah! Yeah sure  just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
Joey, So…What?
Joey, Yes!
Joey, No. What?
Joey, Barmifsaed?
Monica, So to get this part you can’t be?
Joey, Nope.
Monica, But you are?
Joey, Yep.
Monica, But you told them you weren’t?
Joey, That’s right.
Monica, Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?
Joey, I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse  you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Monica, Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!
Joey, I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Monica, Oh my God  what are you gonna do?!
Joey, I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part. 
Monica, Unless!
Joey, Unless what?
Monica, Well  this may sound crazy  but there maybe something we could fashion.
Joey, Like what?
Monica, Well I’m not sure yet  but umm of the top of my head I’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Phoebe, Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay  we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.
Rachel, Okay. Okay. All right  you take care of that. And meanwhile  the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
Phoebe, Okay. Okay! Well okay  who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?
Monica,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey! What’s up Mon?
Monica, Well uh  I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Rachel, Have at it.
Monica, Okay.  All right  turkey. Eh  that won’t work. Cheese?  That won’t work. Olive loaf?  I hope that won’t work.
Rachel, Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
Monica, No it’s umm  more like a wrap. Okay so uh  I’m gonna go guys.
Monica, I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! 
Rachel,  We have to get her a present?!
Phoebe, Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book!  We have a guest list!
Rachel, Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Phoebe, Uh-huh  and a little seed money for the party. 
Ross,  Cassie?!
Ross, Hey!
Ross, Oh. Oh  that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.
Ross, It’s okay. Come  come on in.
Ross, Oh.
Ross, Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
Ross, Yeah—No!!
Ross, Cassie  how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.
Ross,  Thank God.
Ross, Oh right. Right. Ooh  remember the time I uh  I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?  We’re probably too old to do that now.
Ross,  Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.
Ross, Well I’m  I’m a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
Phoebe, Hi!
Phoebe, How are you?  Good.  Hi  thanks for coming.
Phoebe, Thank you.  No?  All right.  Oh  it’s so nice to see you.
Phoebe, Okay.  Hey Rach?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Who the hell are all these people?
Rachel, Well  I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Phoebe, Hmm  y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!
Rachel,  Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Rachel, Ohhhh!
Rachel, That’s great!
Rachel,  Excuse us for a minute.  You didn’t tell her to come?!
Phoebe, You were supposed to tell her!
Rachel, No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Phoebe, Fine  I’ll go call her.
Rachel, Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Monica, Okay  we have a lot of options here  a number of prototypes for you to try on.
Joey, Wow! This looks great!
Monica, Yeah! Okay  this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm  this one is made of bologna. 
Joey, And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Monica, Oh  just until the glue dries.
Joey, Thank God!
Monica,  Now  these are-are more realistic  but perishable.
Joey, Ah.
Monica, Okay?  Over here we have pink suede  which is nice. But umm  if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.
Joey, Well maybe we just take that one away. 
Monica, I also  did a little something in fur. But umm  that’s really just for me.  Okay. So  why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.
Joey, Thanks  you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Joey, Ow!
Monica, Toothpick?
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, What are you trying on now?
Joey, The fruit roll up.
Monica, And?
Joey, Delicious.
Monica, Joey!
Joey, Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Monica, What?! Which one?!
Joey, The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
Ross,  She’s your cousin. She’s your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she’d think you were sick!  Or would she? Let’s back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan’s Run  the sexiest movie ever.  Oh  I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.
Ross,  Say something clever!  Okay  doesn’t have to be clever  it just has to be words. Say some words.  Any words will do.  Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!  There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!!   I-I  I uh haven’t had sex in a very long time.   Yeah  you really shouldn’t have said anything.
Monica, Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
Rachel, Oh Monica  we are so sorry.
Monica, For what?
Rachel, Well first  for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Phoebe, And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica, You al-you already had it?
Phoebe, Yeah. Well  we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came  but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Rachel, Yeah  we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower  and now you don’t have either.
Phoebe, We ruined everything.
Rachel, Ugh…
Monica, Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No  what did  that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
Rachel, What do you  what do you mean?
Monica, Well now  I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean  I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!
Rachel, Surprise…
Phoebe, Sur-surprise.
Rachel, …Monica.
Joey, And what’s cool is  the character is from Naples  right?
Joey, My whole family’s from Naples!
Joey, Oh! Hey right! Not a problem.  I totally understand. You need to y’know make sure I don’t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don’t you worry; I have nothing to hide.  So there you go  that’s me.  One hundred percent natural!   I tell ya  that has never happened before.
Phoebe, Cassie  are you finding everything okay in there?
Phoebe, Oh! No problem! I… 
Phoebe,  Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She’s not your cousin!
Rachel, Hey! Out of all of us  who do you think is gonna get married next?
Joey, Probably Monica and Chandler.
Rachel,  Oh my God  Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.
Rachel,  Melissa!
Rachel, Wh——Why don’t I tell you over here? 
Rachel, Oh no-no  no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!
Rachel, I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!
Rachel, Oh please…
Rachel, No.
Rachel, Oh tomorrow  oh I don’t know. Um…
Rachel, Shut up.
Rachel, Oh  wow thanks!  Oh you’re in real estate!
Rachel, Wow! What do you do now?
Rachel, Okay! 
Joey, Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
Rachel, Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.
Ross, She seems really  really fun!
Rachel, She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.
Monica, Wait a minute  she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…
Joey,  Who you what? Who you what?!
Rachel,  Yes.
Monica, Wow!
Joey,  Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!
Rachel, It’s not a big deal!
Monica,  They were lovers.
Ross, What?!
Joey, What?!
Rachel, No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night  senior year we went to a party  had a lot of sangria and y’know  ended up…kissing for a bit.
Ross, So that’s two of my wives.
Monica,  Okay so this is where the band is.  And this is where the bar is.  And all these pins have people’s names on them.  And Rach  here you are. 
Rachel, Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me  and put me with a Manhattan in my hand  talking to the cute bartender.  These pins aren’t for playing are they?
Monica,  Okay  the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Chandler, This is so sad. I mean  I only have like ten pins.
Monica, Chandler  relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.
Joey,  Hello!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey Rach. 
Rachel, Stop picturing it!!
Monica, Okay  I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?
Joey, Hey  so where are my parents gonna be?
Monica, Oh!  Let’s see  well…if this is the wedding hall then umm  you’re parents will be at home in Queens.
Joey, What they’re not invited?! Oh no  that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!
Monica, Why would they think they’re invited?
Joey,  You got me. I don’t…
Monica, Joey!
Joey, Well  I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!
Monica, Ross’s parents are my parents!
Joey, Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!
Chandler, Y’know I think we should invite them.
Monica, Oh please  you just want more blue pins.
Chandler, Well this is just sad!
Monica, All right  all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh  Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Rachel, That is not a problem.
Joey,  Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?
Rachel, Oh  get out of here! 
Rachel,  So now  these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there’s anything that you like  we can make you a deal. Anything at all.  But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Chandler, Well  thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Rachel, I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!
Chandler,  Well  what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Rachel, Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.
Chandler, You mean like for award shows?
Rachel, Some of them.
Chandler," You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling  ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
Rachel, Honey  might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Chandler, Okay  who wore those? 
Rachel, Umm  well let’s see uh  this one is Tom Brokaw.
Chandler, Not bad.
Rachel,  This one is uh Paul O’Neil.
Chandler, Who’s that?
Rachel, He plays for the Yankees. Seriously  ESPN! Just once and a while  have it on in the background.  Ooh  this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Chandler, Pierce Brosnan?
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Chandler, Are you serious?
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, 007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, Oh  I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
Rachel, It’s a pretty cool tux.
Chandler, Oh  it’s not just that  I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?
Joey, We should really learn how to play the real way. 
Phoebe, I like our way. Oh!  Chess!
Joey, Nice move.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding  do you need one?
Joey, No  I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.
Rachel, Well  what are you going to wear?
Joey, Multi-colored robes! Ooh  and maybe a hat.
Rachel, Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Joey, I don’t think so.
Rachel, Can I please be there when you tell her? 
Phoebe, Hey oh  Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Rachel, Oh  y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Joey,  Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.
Phoebe, What is this? What’s going on?
Joey, Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Rachel, Well  do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
Phoebe, Joey’s!
Joey, Okay…
Rachel, Hey  come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
Phoebe,  Yeah  I’m sure that happened.
Rachel, It-it did!
Phoebe, Sure!
Joey, Hey.  It happened!
Rachel, Yeah  it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Phoebe,  Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Joey, Why are you taking this away from me?
Rachel, Yeah  why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Phoebe, Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. 
Rachel, I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!
Phoebe, Okay  it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.
Rachel,  Vanilla?!
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Phoebe, To Ross.
Rachel, All right  y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this  why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Phoebe, Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
Joey, Oh-ho  you should get inside my head.
Ross, Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! 
Chandler, A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Ross, No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux  Batman’s tux!
Chandler, What?
Ross, That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.
Chandler, You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
Ross, So?
Chandler, So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
Ross, Well  you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Chandler, Please  don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Ross, Pretty please? Not very uh  007.
Chandler, Look  it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
Ross, When I got married you slept with my sister.
Chandler, That was pretty 007.
Joey, Hey.
Monica, Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right  I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight  I’m gonna add your parents  and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals  we are good to go!
Joey, Yeah  they’re not coming.
Monica,  What?!
Joey, Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.
Monica, Oh that’s too bad. It’s true  but too bad.
Joey, Look Mon  if you could just call my mom…
Monica, Oh Joey!
Joey, Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget  this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
Monica, No she hasn’t.
Joey, Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?
Monica, Well  what am I going to say?
Joey, I don’t know. Just uh  just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations  or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so… 
Monica,  Hello?  Yeah  hi! Mrs. Tribbiani?  Hi  this is Monica Geller.  Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh  really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah  apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm  I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office!   T-Tell me about it!  Yeah  yeah  the US Post Office? No  more like US lost office!  What are they Irish?! 
Rachel, Oh. Oh  that’s great!
Phoebe, Of course! Yeah  I was uh  umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Phoebe, Yeah! Y’know  we were really huge too  but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Rachel,  Anyway  speaking of drinking too much. I was uh  tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh  we made out.
Rachel, Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on  and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
Rachel, …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
Phoebe, Really?!
Chandler, Ross is Batman!
Monica, Well  he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Chandler, Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Monica, What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Chandler, Batman has a utility belt!
Monica, 007 has a fancy car!
Chandler, Batman has the Batmobile!
Monica, 007 gets all the ladies.
Chandler, Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?
Monica, How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.
Chandler, Actually  I don’t like martinis.
Monica, How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Chandler, Ooh  yum! 
Joey,  Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Joey, Listen  I know the invitation says 6:00  but does that mean that you want people to get there at six  or the show is gonna start right at six?
Monica, The show?!
Joey, Right. Right. The wedding  gotcha. But I mean  it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean  weddings start late. Right?
Monica, Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Joey, Ah. Yeah. Well look  the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!
Monica, The wedding starts at six.
Joey, Okay. Okay  I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?
Monica, You’ll vamp?!
Joey, Yeah! Yeah y’know  like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer!  There is no one better! There is no one greater!
Rachel, How can you not remember us kissing?!
Rachel, Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?
Phoebe, Oh  somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
Rachel, Yeah—but come on—Listen  I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable  but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.
Rachel, No!!
Phoebe, Rachel  it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay  if-if you say that you kissed Melissa  then you kissed Melissa.
Rachel, Thank you Phoebe.
Phoebe, I know.
Ross, Hey!
Monica, You just carry that around?
Ross, Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Monica, Between you and…
Ross, Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.
Chandler, I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
Monica, A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Ross, Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Chandler, Well  does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
Ross, What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!
Chandler,  Let me try it on!
Ross, Okay  but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.
Chandler,  Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  What’s this?
Ross, What?
Chandler, An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Ross, Let me see that!  Oh man!
Chandler, The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. 
Joey,  Hey! Uh  Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica, All right that’s it  I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!
Joey, No! No  I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents  that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Monica,  Oh.
Chandler, Well  you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.
Joey, Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!  Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys  and then this  is for party time.
Rachel, It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Rachel, What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute!  Okay? Look  that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life  and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay  so if you don’t remember that  maybe you will remember this! 
Rachel,  What?
Rachel,  Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Rachel,  I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!
Rachel, I’m sorry!
Rachel, Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…
Rachel, What the hell was that?!
Phoebe, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Rachel, And?
Phoebe, I’ve had better.
Chandler,  All right! I found one that fits!
Rachel, Well y’know what they say  the 23rd time’s the charm.  Aww  look at you all handsome!
Chandler, Whose is it?
Rachel, Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Chandler, Whose is it?
Rachel, I don’t want to say.
Chandler, Oh  come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?
Rachel, Diane Keeton.
Monica, Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
Chandler, Do you realize you get louder each week?
Monica, There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
Chandler, I figured I’d buy those. Pat  I’d like to buy a vow. 
Monica, Sweetie  you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Chandler, Right. So uh  have you written yours yet?
Monica, No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.
Chandler, Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
Monica,  Let’s just do it right now. Okay? It won’t be hard. Just say what’s in your heart. 
Chandler,   Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh  don’t open that door.
Chandler,  Monica  there are no words…  There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Joey, All right  uh…  Oh hey  you’ve done this before Ross  well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Ross, Well with Carol  I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Chandler, I’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should’ve seen her. Writing  writing  writing!
Rachel, Monica what?
Phoebe, What?!
Rachel, What is the emergency?!
Monica, You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this! 
Rachel, Well  I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Monica, Thank you.
Phoebe, Yeah  except your breasts look kinda small. 
Monica, Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. 
Phoebe, Oh! Yeah! 
Ross, Well  why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm  Monica from the moment I met you  I knew I loved you.
Chandler, Yeah  I’m not sure I can do that.
Ross, ...everyone  this is Chandler!
Chandler,  Okay.
Rachel," Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm  maybe you can start with  ""Chandler  even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."""
Chandler, All right  there’s a nuclear holocaust  I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Monica, Ennnh.
Monica, Ooh  are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Phoebe, Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…  Or all the things you taught him.
Monica, Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one  two three  four   five  six  and seven!
Chandler,  There are seven?!  That’s one?
Monica, It’s kind of an important one!
Chandler, Oh  y’know-y’know what  I was looking at it upside down.
Rachel, Well  y’know  sometimes that helps. 
Monica, All right. Umm  you could uh start out with a little 1  a 2  a 1-2-3  3  5  a 4  a 3-2  2  a 2-4-6  2-4-6  4   2  2  4-7  5-7  6-7  7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…! 
Joey," Oh  I got it! How about saying something like  ""Monica…"
Chandler,  Monica…
Joey," ""…when I look back over our time together…"""
Chandler,  Yeah?
Joey, Well  I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.
Phoebe, Oh  look  twins. Hi  guys. Oh  cute  cute.
Monica, No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler, You'll get one.
Monica, Oh yeah? When?
Chandler, All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40  if neither one of us are married  what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Monica, Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, Oh  no  no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica, Ok  hypothetically  why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler, No  no  no.
Monica, What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Chandler,  Uh  uh.
Monica, Well?
Chandler, Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
Ross,  I’m getting married today!! Ahh  whoo-hoo!!
Monica,  Do you think he knew I was here? 
Chandler, Nice try.
Monica, Wait  wait  wait! 
Chandler, Look  Monica…
Monica, Look! 
Chandler, This is not going to work.
Monica, I bet this will work! 
Chandler, You are so great! I love you!
Monica, What?
Chandler," Nothing! I said  I said ""You're so great"" and then I just  I just stopped talking!"
Monica, You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler, No I didn't!
Monica, Yes  you did!
Chandler, No I didn't!
Monica, You love me!
Chandler, No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Chandler,  Y’know I was thinking  what if I uh  unpack here?
Monica, Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler, Well  what if all my stuff was here?
Monica, Then you’d be going back and forth all the time  I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
Chandler, Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
Monica, You wanted it to be a surprise.
Chandler, Oh my God.
Monica, Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
Chandler, Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God  I thought…  Wait a minute  I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you   you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if you’ll let me  I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica  will you marry me?
Monica, Yes.
Joey,  Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Monica, Come in! Come in!  We’re engaged!!!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hey  what have you guys been up to?
Ross, Oh  we were helping Chandler write his vows  but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Joey," How is ""Monica  I love your sweet ass "" inappropriate?"
Ross, How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
Phoebe, Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass  ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
Ross, I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
Phoebe, Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
Ross, Phoebe that’s not true.
Phoebe, Yeah  you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
Rachel, I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
Joey,  Has it been that long?!
Ross, Believe me  it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Joey, Hey  it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler, I've had a very long  hard day.
Joey, Ahh  I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler, Ahh  no thanks. No chicken  bye-bye then.
Joey, Okay.
Chandler, Are you okay? I'm so sorry  he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Monica, Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler, Hey Joe!
Chandler, Yeah  can I get a 3-piece  some cole slaw  some beans  and a Coke——Diet Coke.
Rachel, I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.
Joey, I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
Joey,  You?!  And-and you?!
Monica, Yes  but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey, How?! When?!
Chandler, It happened in London.
Joey, IN LONDON!!!
Chandler, The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
Joey, But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
Chandler, No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica, Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone  okay? Just promise you won't tell.
Joey, All right! Man  this is unbelievable!
Monica,  I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Chandler,  Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? 
Monica,  Awww  y'know what your nickname is  Mr. Big…
Rachel, Arghh!! 
Phoebe,  Oh  look! There's Monica and Chandler!  Hey! Hey  you guys! Hey!  Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe,  Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel, Oh my God!
Phoebe, CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Rachel, OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe, OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel, Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe, NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Rachel, I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe, YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel, Yes  I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Ross,  What's going on?
Rachel,  HI!! Hi!
Ross, What?! What?!
Rachel, Nothing! Oh God  we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Ross, Actually  it looks really good. 
Phoebe,  Get in here!!! 
Phoebe, Okay  so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Joey, Yes  but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now  enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Phoebe, Or  we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Rachel, All right honey  we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica, Bye!
Phoebe, Bye Chandler!   I miss you already. 
Chandler,  Okay  did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Monica, Actually  I did!
Chandler, Okay  so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica, Ohhh  oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler, Phoebe knows about us!
Joey, Well I didn't tell them!
Monica, Them?! Who's them?
Joey, Uhhh  Phoebe and Joey.
Monica, Joey!
Joey, And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Monica, Oh man  they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…
Chandler, Ahh yes  the messers become the messies!
Phoebe, I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay  bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel, Are you kidding?!
Phoebe, No!
Rachel, I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey  do they know that we know?
Joey, No.
Rachel, Joey!
Joey, They know you know.
Rachel, Ugh  I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe, God  they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey  you can't say anything!
Joey, I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Chandler, Listen  this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
Monica, She's bluffing!
Chandler, Look  she's not backing down! She went like this! 
Phoebe, He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey,  Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Rachel, Joey look  just look at it this way  the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey, Ooh!
Rachel, Okay!
Joey, I like that!  Oh  okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! 
Phoebe, Joey!  Wow  you didn’t rip off any buttons.
Joey, It's not my first time.
Monica, You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler, Okay  give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Monica, Of course.
Chandler, Oh  you're-you're going?
Phoebe, Umm  not without you  lover.  So  this is my bra.
Chandler,  It's very  very nice. Well  come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
Phoebe, You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler, Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe, Ooh.
Chandler, Well  I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe, Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Chandler, Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe, And why not?!
Chandler, Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe, You're-you're what?!
Chandler, Love her! That's right  I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you  Monica.
Monica, I love you too Chandler. 
Phoebe, I just—I thought you guys were doing it  I didn't know you were in love!
Joey,  So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Monica, Well actually  Ross doesn't.
Chandler, Yes  and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Ross,  No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!!  GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Phoebe, Y’know  you’re friend’s getting married  it’s gotta change things.
Rachel, You really think it would be that different?
Phoebe, How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids  and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
Rachel, Well  things change.
Joey, I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
Ross, It’ll be okay Joe.
Joey, I’m sorry  I just…I like things the way they are.
Rachel, Hey  who's this little naked guy?
Ross, That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel, Aww  look at the little thing.
Ross, Yes  yes  fine  that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler, Who are those people?
Ross, Got me.
Monica, Oh  that's Nana  right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Rachel, Wow  Monica  you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica, Let's see  1939... yeah  24  25?
Ross, Looks like a fun gang. 
Joey, Ooh  look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross,  Nono  that would be me again.
Monica, Hey  you guys!
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, What’s going on?
Rachel, Well  we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.
Joey, Yeah  you can get a Volvo. If that’s what you really want.
Monica, Oh that’s so sweet.
Chandler, So we both finished our vows.
Phoebe, Oh!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Oh  can we read them?
Monica, Yeah  I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe,  Oh  that’s beautiful.
Joey,   Funny one! That’s good!
Rachel,  Monica  will-will you marry me?
Joey, What? I don’t get it.
Ross,  Oh man  this is hilarious.
Monica, Chandler!!
Chandler, Don’t worry honey  we’ll make yours funnier.
Chandler, Okay  what do you guys think?
Ross,  Dude!
Joey,  I have never known love like this.
Chandler, You really like it?
Ross, Dude! How-how did you write this?
Chandler, I stole Monica’s and changed the name.
Ross, You can’t do that!
Joey, If he goes first he can!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey uh Mon  I saw the Porsche parked out front  can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Rachel, Wait a minute!  You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you  you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
Monica, Yeah  well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
Ross, It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!
Monica, Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.
Joey,  Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Saw the Porsche out there Mon  lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Rachel,  You let Joey drive it?!
Phoebe, I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay  I drive it all the time.
Monica," Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know  ""You can drive it  but don’t tell Rachel"" plan!"
Rachel, Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
Phoebe, Okay  I can fix this! Okay Monica  Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding. 
Monica, Great! Well Rachel  the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.
Ross, Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Joey, Yeah  you got a couple hours?
Ross, Whew! That was a brisk ride!
Rachel, Take the top down did ya?
Ross, Only way to fly.
Rachel, Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
Ross, You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Rachel, Well in High School  that added up to head cheerleader.
Ross, Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.
Rachel, I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
Ross, What?!  Give-give me a brush.
Rachel, Gimme the keys!
Ross, No way!
Rachel, Well no brush!
Ross, Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter  because  if I remember correctly  there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Rachel,  Alimony. 
Monica, Chandler  we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Chandler, Oh! Right. Umm  maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
Monica, Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.
Chandler, I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.
Monica, Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!
Chandler, Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys  and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Phoebe, Ooh  I think I wanna trade circles.
Chandler, Trust me  you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Monica, So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.
Phoebe, Okay  I think I need to do some shopping. 
Rachel, Ahhh!  Ooh  nice!
Rachel, My God!
Ross, What do you think you’re doing?!
Rachel, Just washing the windshield. 
Ross, There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!  Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! 
Rachel, Look Ross  if you’re so freaked out  just get in the car!
Ross, With you?! Yeah right!
Rachel, All right. 
Ross,  Okay! Okay! Okay! 
Rachel, What are you doing?! Get in the front!
Ross, In the death seat?!!
Rachel, Oh my…
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey sweetie!
Phoebe, Yeah! Sure! Ooh  I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back. 
Phoebe, What?  Oh.  Ooh.  Whoa! That one kept going. 
Joey, So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Joey, Wow! Maybe uh  maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Joey, So uh  what’s your name?
Joey, Joey.  Hey Jake  do you like the Knicks?
Joey, Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Monica, Here! 
Chandler, What’s this?
Monica, It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.
Chandler, Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
Monica, We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked  and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Chandler, Y’know we already went over this and I won!
Monica, No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know  now that you’re marrying me  you don’t get to win anymore.
Chandler, Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
Monica, Chandler  look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…
Chandler, No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents  you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School  he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Monica, Hey  the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a  that’s a pretty great dad.
Chandler, He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Monica, Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?
Chandler, Does it matter?!
Monica, Chandler  you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Chandler, Yeah o-okay  but I’m just doing this for you.
Monica, Yes!
Chandler, So I really never get to win anymore?
Monica, How much did ever really win before?
Joey, Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Listen  you know how uh  when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Joey, Well  when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!
Phoebe, I know. They were mine.
Joey, Oh.  No! No wait  that’s weird!
Phoebe, No  it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Joey, That’s weird!
Phoebe, I’m wearing his briefs right now.
Joey, That’s…kinda hot.
Phoebe, I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Joey, Yeah  I wouldn’t know about that.
Phoebe, And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Joey, Yeah well next thing you know  he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
Phoebe, There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
Joey, Oh yeah  he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.
Phoebe, I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
Joey, Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
Phoebe, Okay whatever.
Joey, You’ve seen my huge stack of porn right? 
Rachel, God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.
Ross,  You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Rachel, Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax… 
Ross,  What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Rachel, I am not horsing around okay? I am Porsching around.
Rachel, Uh-oh. 
Ross, Okay  stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you  you are not in that much trouble.
Rachel, Really? You think so?
Ross, I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
Monica, Uh oh yeah  she did. Uh  he did.  She?  I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…
Chandler, Yeah  I just ordered a beer! 
Monica, I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Chandler, No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Monica, Why not?!
Chandler, I don’t know if I’ve told you this  but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Monica, What?!
Chandler, Yeah  he’s made phone calls  written letters  he even came to New York  but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it.  Here we go.
Chandler, And there’s daddy!
Rachel, Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under  you go over!
Ross, Yeah  I’ll get right on that.
Rachel, Oh come on Ross!! 
Ross, No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah  I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
Rachel,  Hi officer  was I going a little too fast?
Ross, Oh my God.
Rachel, Oh yes  absolutely! Y’know  it’s weird uh  but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.
Rachel,  Yes. Here you go Officer uh  Handsome.
Rachel, Oops sorry  my mistake.
Ross, Dear Lord!!
Ross, Here it comes.
Rachel, Really?! You think so? Y’know  I had just rolled out of bed.
Ross, Well she should  it was taken ten years ago!
Rachel, Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, I bet you’re a Gemini.
Rachel, Taurus?
Rachel, Virgo?
Rachel, Sagittarius?
Rachel, I knew it! I knew it  ahh….
Rachel, Yeah?
Rachel, I won’t speed.
Rachel, I promise.
Rachel, Yeah!
Rachel, Oh well…
Ross, I can handle the stick!!
Monica, That can’t be your father.
Chandler, Believe me  I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
Monica, What?
Chandler, That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
Chandler, He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
Monica, Relax! You’ll be fine.  Oh much better. You’re invisible now.
Chandler, It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.
Monica, Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh  tress!
Joey, Hey Pheebs! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
Phoebe, Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Joey, Y’know  I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Joey, The silk? Feels really good!
Phoebe, Huh.
Joey, Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
Phoebe, That’s great Joe!
Joey, Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Joey, Bikini  French cut  thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton  silk  lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?
Phoebe, Hmm?
Joey, Pantyhose! Y’know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here…  I should go take these off shouldn’t I?
Phoebe, I think it’s important that you do.
Chandler,  Chandler. 
Chandler, Oh  they’re a hoot.
Monica, I’m-I’m Monica.
Monica, New York.
Chandler, Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Monica,  In…in two weeks.
Chandler, Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
Chandler, I know it would make me happy  ma’am.
Monica,  You okay?
Chandler, Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Chandler,  When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.
Rachel, Remind me to introduce you to someone!
Ross, Who?
Rachel, Fourth gear!!
Ross, What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
Rachel, Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.
Ross, Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more! 
Rachel, It’s a different guy!
Ross, Good evening officer.
Ross, Ah no. I don’t  but it could not have been more than sixty.
Ross, I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
Ross, Y’know of-officer I uh…I had the weirdest dream last night…
Rachel, Oh my God!
Ross,  You don’t-you don’t want to hear about my dream Officer…Pretty?
Rachel,  You have a son!
Ross, I know. I know.
Phoebe, Feel better?
Joey, Yeah! Much! Listen uh  not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know  but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Phoebe, Yeah  I understand.
Joey, Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
Joey, Y’know  you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
Joey, Oh! Maybe it’s because I’m on television. I’m an actor on Days of Our Lives.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Hm-mmm.
Joey, Oh  let me get this.    These are for you.
Monica, Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
Phoebe, Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?!  Oh! 
Chandler, Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
Monica, Old?
Chandler, The young hot ball and chain.
Monica, That’s much better.
Rachel,  Op! We gotta go! 
Ross, Oh  where are you guys going?
Monica, We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress then we’re gonna have lunch with mom. 
Ross, Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
Joey, No  I-I just heard lunch. But yeah  I can go. Sure! 
Ross,  Y’know what? Actually I’m kinda glad they’re leaving ‘cause uh  I need to talk to you about something.
Chandler, What’s up?
Ross, Well this uh  this may be a little awkward.
Chandler, Listen  if you want to borrow money  its kind of a bad time. I’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
Ross, No  its…Its not that. Umm  now what I’m going to say to you  I’m not saying as your friend. Okay? I’m-I’m saying as it as Monica’s older brother.
Chandler, But you’re still my friend?
Ross, Not for the next few minutes.
Chandler, During this time…are you  are you still my best man?
Ross, Nope.
Chandler, Do I still call you Ross?
Ross, Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn’t be more thrilled for both of you  but as Monica’s older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister  if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind  I will hunt you down  and kick your ass!  What? I’m-I’m-I’m serious!  Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I’m-I’m not kidding here!
Chandler,  Hey  I hear what your saying  okay? And  thanks for the warning.
Ross, No problem.
Chandler, So are we…friends again?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Okay.  You won’t believe what Monica’s older brother just said to me!
Rachel, What ‘cha doing Mon?
Monica, I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now  that way I can be prepared.
Phoebe, What are they?
Monica, Well  so far I have uh  my bride’s maids dresses won’t get picked up  my veil gets lost  or I don’t have my something blue.
Rachel, Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!
Monica, I had to go with the odds Rach.
Joey,  Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn’t get the part?
Rachel, The commercial?
Joey, No!
Phoebe, That play?
Joey, No!
Monica, That other play?
Joey, Nooo!
Phoebe, The movie?
Joey, Yes!!
Phoebe, Ohh!
Joey, Yes that’s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
Phoebe, Oh  yeah! Back then y’know  we called the Great War. It really was!
Joey, Well anyway  the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!
Phoebe, Congratulations!
Rachel, Oh that’s great!

Rachel, You’re gonna be late! Go! Go! 
Monica, Who did we fight in World War I?
Rachel, Mexico?
Phoebe, Yes! Very good.
Joey, Yeah! Me too. 
Joey, I’m doing my scenes with you?
Joey, Wow! I can’t believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
Joey, I think you did.

Joey, We have to find the rest of the platoon!
Joey,  What?!
Joey,  So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
Joey,  No. Nope  I uh…I th—I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y’know? He’s uh  he’s a face toucher. 
Monica, Honey  we gotta go!
Chandler,  Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
Monica,  I don’t have anything like that  but let me go see if Rachel does.
Chandler, Yes  include more people in this.
Monica, Hey  do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?
Chandler, Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
Monica, I just  I can’t believe that we made it!
Chandler, Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
Monica, I’m sorry but…nothing.
Chandler, What?
Monica, Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to  to flip you out.
Chandler, Honestly? Me too.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.
Monica, Ohh  I’m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it’s really  it’s made me stay calm.  I coulda been worse!

Ross, Dad…dad  please! As I was saying umm  I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh  and I’m the best man. And uh  this marriage is doubly special for me umm  because not only is the groom my best friend but uh  the bride is my little sister. And  she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the  the couple we’re here to celebrate.  To the Bings.
Monica, All right  I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
Rachel, I’ll do it.
Monica, Who wants it? Anybody?
Rachel, I said I’ll do it!
Monica, Nobody wants to do it? All right  I’ll do it myself.
Rachel, Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
Monica, Y’know what? You’re right  I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah  and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Rachel, Well of course that is what I’m here for!
Monica, Okay. Sorry. 
Rachel, Ugh!  What grandmother?
Joey, Hey! Where have you been?
Ross, Oh  taking my parents back to the hotel.
Joey, Oh.
Ross, What? Are you going back to work?
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Nice shades.
Joey, Thanks. Yeah  I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes  y’know?
Ross, And if I remember correctly  Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Joey, Great! All right. I’ll see you later. 
Ross, Hey  where’s Chandler?
Joey, Uh  I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya. 
Ross,  Chandler?  Chandler? 
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Is uh  is Monica here?
Rachel, She’s steaming her dress  why? What’s up?
Ross, I think Chandler’s gone. 
Rachel, What?!
Ross, He left that.
Rachel,  Tell Monica I’m sorry.
Phoebe,  What’s up?  Tell Monica I’m sorry.  Tell her yourself!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
Rachel, Yeah but  maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.
Phoebe, Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name  y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.
Ross, I think it means he freaked out and left!
Phoebe, Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!
Rachel, Okay. Phoebe  I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Ross, Look—Okay  I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out  okay?
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe,  Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back  I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
Ross,  I will  I will find him.
Joey, Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Joey, All right.
Joey, Picture? What picture?
Joey, Okay uh  look I know you’re a great actor  okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…
Joey, But you’re spittin’ all over me man!
Joey, You know you’ve been spitting on me?!
Joey,  Wow! Didn’t know that.
Joey, Thanks! Okay-okay check it out!  Picture? What picture?  Eh?
Ross, Gunther have you uh  have you seen Chandler?
Ross, Oh damn!
Ross, Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh  we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.
Ross, Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow.  Mom?! Dad?!  What-what…what you guys doing here?!
Ross, Why?!
Ross,  Gunther?!
Ross, What? Your-your list?
Ross, Yes! No-no! I know  I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler  could you just let him know I’m looking for him?
Joey, What picture?!
Joey, You went through my personal property?
Joey,  Because Vincent  we were lovers.  For two years!
Joey, Great scene yeah?
Joey, Thanks a lot.
Joey, Oh  I’m-I’m not working tomorrow.
Joey, No! No! I can’t! You gotta get me out of it! I’ve got plans!  Important plans! 
Rachel,  Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.
Phoebe, Oh man.
Rachel, Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
Phoebe, Okay. Well there’s one down.
Monica,  I’m getting married today!!!   I think I just cracked a rib. But I don’t care because today’s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! 
Phoebe, Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.
Monica,  I’m gonna start getting ready! 
Rachel, God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God  but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…
Phoebe, Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here! 
Rachel, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!
Phoebe, Yeah  but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!
Rachel, I know. I know. Oh God.  There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Phoebe, Yeah.  Oh  that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!
Rachel, Oh!
Phoebe, No-no! I-I…I found one.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Oh thank you!  Oh God!  Can I have another one?
Phoebe,  Sure.  Do you need some floss? 
Rachel, Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!
Phoebe, Oh here’s a whole bunch.
Rachel," Oh  I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering  ""Oh that poor girl."" Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone."
Phoebe,  Oh my God!
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, There was a pregnancy test in the garbage  and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant.  So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Phoebe, I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey  can this count as her something new?
Rachel, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Hey  do you think this is why Chandler took off?
Rachel, No  she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Phoebe, Oh God  this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this. 
Rachel, Okay Phoebe  we can not tell anyone about this.
Phoebe, Right.
Rachel, Okay?
Phoebe, Yeah  okay. Hey  wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
Rachel, No. Why?
Phoebe, Just for the future  this is hardly a commercial for it.
Rachel, Anything?
Ross, No! I talked to Joey on the set  he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
Phoebe, You told them he was missing?
Ross, No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure  they both think I’m interested in them.
Rachel, All right  we’ve got to tell her he’s gone. 
Ross, No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
Rachel, Ross  she’s gonna start getting ready soon!
Ross, Well  can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
Rachel, All right  well how much time do you need?
Ross, Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
Rachel, One hour.
Ross, Give me two.
Rachel, Then why do you ask?!
Ross, Okay  wish me luck.
Phoebe, Okay. I’m going with you.
Ross, Why?!
Phoebe, Ross  you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
Rachel, All right  I’ll see you guys later.
Phoebe, Okay. Wait  do you know how you’re going to stall her?
Rachel, I’ll figure something out.
Phoebe, All right. Good luck.
Rachel, Thanks.
Monica, Hey! Okay  so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.
Rachel, Okay uh  but before you do that. I-I  I need you to talk to me.
Monica, About what?
Rachel, Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!
Monica, Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay  are we done with that?
Rachel, No Monica! I’m serious! Oh  maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Monica, Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Rachel, Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Monica,  Rachel! You okay?
Joey, Excuse me  Aaron?  Hi! Umm  I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally  I wasn’t supposed to work today  and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s  and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.
Joey, I’m having surgery!
Joey, Yeah  I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But  I’m having surgery today.
Joey, Transplant.
Joey, Hair transplant.
Joey, It’s not on my head.
Joey, Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy  we’ve got a scene to shoot!
Joey, Are you drunk?
Joey, Yes you are!
Ross, We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Is that him? 
Ross, That is an old  Chinese woman!
Phoebe, He could be in disguise  y’know.
Ross, Aw  y’know…Y’know  maybe we’re-we’re just approaching this all wrong. If you’re Chandler and-and you wanna hide  where is the last place on Earth people would think you’d go?
Ross, So this is your office?
Chandler, How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
Phoebe, What the hell are you doing?!
Chandler, Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?
Ross, She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know  okay? Now come on  we’re going home.
Chandler, No! No! No! I can’t do that!
Phoebe, Why not?!
Chandler, Because if I go home  we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!
Ross, What’s wrong with being the Bings?
Chandler, The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Ross, Chandler  have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
Chandler, No.
Ross, Then you are neither of your parents!
Chandler, It’s not just their marriage! I mean  look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Phoebe, But look Chandler  right now  no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Chandler, I want to. I love her so much  but I’m afr…It’s too huge.
Ross, Y’know  okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm  forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
Chandler, Well yeah  but then…
Ross,  Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now  that’s not scary right?
Chandler, Depends on what you mean by we.
Rachel, The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…
Monica,  The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm  Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!
Rachel, I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.
Monica,  I’m gonna go put my make up on  we have to be at the hotel in an hour! 
Rachel, Okay. But wait!
Monica, What?!
Rachel, Let’s go to lunch.
Monica, I can’t go to lunch!!
Rachel, Right.
Rachel, Oh good God! I’ve fallen down! 
Monica,  What’s going on?
Rachel, Okay. All right.  Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you  I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
Monica, Okay  you’re-you’re really freaking me out.
Rachel, We can’t find Chandler…—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.
Monica, How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you  are you serious?!
Phoebe,  Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it  y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…
Rachel, Oh!
Monica," Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like  ""Oh my God! The worst has happened!"""
Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Joey, What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
Joey, Look  my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
Joey, Thank you. Thank you.
Joey, I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
Phoebe, So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Phoebe, Oh my God Monica!
Monica, I wanna wear this everyday.
Rachel, You look so beautiful.
Monica,  I’m so happy for me.
Rachel, Hello?
Joey,  Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Rachel, Yeah  we got him back. Everything’s fine.
Joey, Damnit!
Rachel, What? Why? Where are you?
Joey, I’m still on the set!
Rachel, Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Joey, I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk  they won’t let me go until we get this.
Rachel, Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
Joey, No! No  I’m the minister! All right  look-look  put ‘em both on the phone  I’ll marry them right now.
Rachel, Ugh! Joey  I have to go.
Joey, Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Ross, There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary  was it?
Chandler, No.
Ross, I’m telling you  just a little bit at a time.
Chandler, Yeah okay. Well  what’s the next little bit?
Ross, Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can  you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!
Chandler, Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Okay  excuse me for a minute. 
Ross, Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa  where  where you going?!
Chandler, Ross  I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Ross, Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, Oh fresh air!
Phoebe,  Wait! Maybe  maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.
Rachel, Well Phoebe  we gotta do something!  Well  y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.
Phoebe, Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because  they frown on that.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding  excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek  because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me  they were written on a sign.} Congratulations.  Mazel Tov!  Hi! Oh  great hat.  Listen umm  I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
Rachel, Yeah! Yeah. They’re…they’re-they’re my friends  uh  Monica Stephanopolus and uh  and Chandler Acidofolus.
Ross, Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm  anyone seen Chandler?
Ross, He-he was with me umm  we’re playing a little game  y’know? Hide and seek.
Ross,  You’re right  thanks for keeping me honest dad.
Ross, Oh my God! Monica!
Monica, I know! Hey  how’s Chandler doin’?
Ross, Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.
Monica, Are you okay?
Ross, Uh-huh.
Monica, Well  you’re-you’re sweating.
Ross, These-these are beads of joy.
Monica, Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.
Ross, Uh Phoebe  can I see you for a second?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Phoebe, What’s going on?
Ross, Chandler’s gone again!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Joey, Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!
Joey, So I uh  I just talked to the director. That’s it  we’re done for the day.
Joey, Yeah! You…you were wonderful.
Joey, So I got your car  it’s right outside.

Chandler, Ross! 
Ross, Hiiii-Ya!!  I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!
Chandler,  That’s right! I’m not!
Ross, Then where the hell have you been?!
Chandler, I know about Monica.
Phoebe, You know?!
Ross, What?
Chandler, Yeah  I heard you and Rachel talking.
Ross, What?! What?! Talking about what?!
Chandler, You don’t know?
Ross, Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…
Phoebe, What? You’ll hi-ya?
Chandler, Monica’s pregnant.
Ross, Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?
Chandler, Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…
Chandler, Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop  and that’s when I uh  saw this.  New York.) Yeah  y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this  can’t be scary.
Phoebe, Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
Chandler, But come on  look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.
Ross, Dude. 
Chandler, You look beautiful mom.  You look beautiful too dad. I love you both.  I’m so glad you here. 
Chandler, Are you Joey?
Ross, Huh. This is nice.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, I’ve never walked down the aisle knowing it can’t end in divorce.
Monica, She’s right there.
Chandler, You look beautiful. Is this new? 
Monica, Not now.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  Who is this?
Chandler,  He’s Greek Orthodox.
Rachel,  As are you…
Joey,  That’s my line!  I can take it from here  thanks.  Dearly beloved  I’m sorry I’m a little late. You may be confused by this now   but you won’t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well  let’s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh?  We are gathered here today  to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time  and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now  as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Monica,  He took off?
Rachel, Go on! Go on. 
Monica, Chandler  for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince  my soul mate. Then three years ago  at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead  I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you  my prince  my soul mate  my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!
Joey, Chandler?
Chandler,  No  that’s okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay  because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure? 
Joey, You may not kiss the bride. So  I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys  I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Chandler, I do.
Monica, I do.
Joey, Yeah you do!
Ross, Rings?
Joey, Aw crap! Okay—uh…uh let’s-let’s do the rings.
Joey, We good? Yeah? Good? Once again  I pronounce you husband and wife.  Now kiss her again.
Chandler,  I love you. And I know about the baby.
Monica, What baby?
Chandler, Our baby.
Monica, We have a baby?
Chandler, Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
Monica, I didn’t take a pregnancy test.
Chandler, Then…who did?
Phoebe, Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Ross, Uh  oh-oh  umm no you didn’t. I did.

Monica,  When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon. 
Monica, When you were little you slept through the Grand——Oh fffff….

Joey, Nothin’.
Ross, That tastes like feet!
Ross, That tastes like feet!
Monica, Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?
Chandler, You see  I don’t say—
Phoebe,  Oh  sweet Je——sus! Oh! Monica  these are the  cookies they serve in hell!
Chandler,  Whoa! She’s purty!
Joey, Oh yeah  and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know  how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
Monica, Joey?
Rachel, I’m sorry…
Ross, Excuse me  what?

Joey, Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Monica, Guys! I’m not pregnant.
Joey, Ah.  Slow swimmers? 
Ross, What?! What do you mean? You-you-you’re not pregnant?
Monica, You didn’t tell anybody I was did you?!
Ross, No!  I’ll be right back. 
Monica,  Oh  about that. Joey  you have to change before the party.
Joey, I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.
Monica, Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France. 
Phoebe, Okay.  Hey Mon  why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
Monica, Because I’m not.
Phoebe, We found your test in the trash  if you’re not pregnant——It’s because I am.
Chandler, What?! What are you talking about?
Monica, What are you talking about?
Phoebe, Yes  I…I am with child.  And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.
Monica, Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?!  Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Chandler, Who’s the father?
Monica, Yeah!
Phoebe, I can’t say.
Monica, Why?!
Chandler, Why not?
Phoebe, I can’t say because he’s famous.
Rachel, Oh my God  who is it?! 
Monica, Phoebe  come on  you have to tell us.
Phoebe, Okay  okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
Chandler, As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
Phoebe, What?! Well he never said that to me!
Phoebe, How about just the bridemaids?
Chandler, Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Phoebe, It is.
Rachel, For you. 
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Rachel, Oh  thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.
Phoebe, So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Rachel, You said that she was  I just didn’t disagree with you.
Phoebe, Sneaky.
Rachel, Oh yeah.
Rachel, Oh!  Oh by the way?
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Rachel, James Brolin?
Phoebe, Oh  I know. I could only think of two names  him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he’s gay.
Rachel, Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Phoebe,  Really?!
Chandler, Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
Monica, Honey  I’m going to put my hand in your pocket!
Chandler, No?
Monica, No.
Chandler, I’ve been taking dancing lessons.
Monica, What?!
Chandler, Yeah  the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
Monica, Oh that is so sweet!
Chandler, So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Monica, Yes.
Monica, What’s the matter?
Chandler, I don’t know  it’s these new shoes  they’re all slippery.
Monica, Well  are you going to be able to do this?
Chandler, Not well.
Monica, Well  the good news is  I don’t think anyone’s looking at us.
Phoebe, So  are you ready to talk about it?
Rachel, No.
Phoebe, Now?
Rachel, No!
Phoebe, Okay  we’ll talk about something else then.
Rachel, Thank you.
Phoebe, Who’s the father?!
Rachel, Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet  so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.
Phoebe, Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?
Rachel, Phoebe!!
Phoebe, Okay  I’m sorry. I’ll stop.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God  it’s Joey!
Rachel, Honey  stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Phoebe, Ah-hah! At least we know it’s a him.
Monica,  Oh sweet Lord.
Joey, I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look  what’s more important  the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?
Monica, Honey  I’m not even going to pretend I was listening.  Hey! Hey! 
Ross, Hi. I’m uh  I’m Ross. I don’t  I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.
Ross, Oh! Hello uh  Mona from her restaurant.   Mona  wow what a  what a beautiful name.
Ross, Aw come on  Mona Lisa?
Ross, Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No  supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
Ross, Linda Clickclocken.  So what uh  what-what table are you at?  Oh  uh me too.
Ross,  Yes there will.  Oh guess what  Molly Gilbert you’ve just been bumped up to table one. And if it’s all right with you I’m gonna take your place at table six—Martin Clickclocken.
Joey, That’s better  now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay  look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. 
Chandler, Thank you.
Chandler, Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Joey, I don’t believe we’ve met  Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, Wow  I’ve admired your work for years. You-you’ve done some really amazing stuff.
Joey, Wow Dennis Phillips! That’s great! How did you guys meet?
Chandler, Funny: ha-ha or funny: 
Ross, Hey! Uh  I thought  I thought you were at table six.
Ross, Oh see  before you uh  when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh  which was misleading. Well I’m…  Hello.
Joey, Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all  film  television  and theater. The only think left would be radio  and that’s just for ugly people.
Chandler, What size shoes do you wear?
Joey, Uh  eleven  eleven and a half.
Chandler, Great  because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor  can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Joey, Uh  I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.
Chandler,  Those aren’t eleven and a half.
Joey, Okay fine! I’m a seven! All right  I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good  I’ll show ya!
Monica, Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Rachel, Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
Monica, This is so huge.
Rachel, Sure  but come on  as big as your wedding?
Monica, Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…
Rachel, Yeah.
Monica, …in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
Rachel, Hey! Y’know  sometimes you can do everything right  everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear  and one of those little guys just gets through!
Monica, How?
Rachel, I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
Monica, Well I-I talked to and uh  she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know  she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
Rachel, Well  maybe that’s  maybe that’s really brave.
Monica, Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.
Rachel, Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
Monica, Well  there’s a lot to think about. I mean  how is she  how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
Rachel,  I don’t know.
Monica, Are you okay?
Rachel, Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Rachel, Oh yes! Thank you very much!  Oh that’s-that’s actually how the French drink it.
Phoebe, Well  I just got off the phone with my lover  James Brolin…
Monica, Oh really?!
Phoebe," Yes  and apparently he is married to some singer  but he said he would leave her for me. And I said  ""James  James Brolin  are you sure?"" James Brolin said…"
Monica,  Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.
Phoebe,  What?!  Why bother?
Monica, How do you feel?
Rachel, I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make.  Somebody just take this away from me!!
Phoebe, Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe, When I got pregnant with the triplets  I took that test like three times just to make sure.
Monica, Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
Rachel, How many ways are there to do that?
Phoebe, I’m-I’m just saying  don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.
Rachel, All right  I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.
Monica, You-you gotta take it now. Come on  do it as a present to me.
Rachel, Okay. Thank you.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, I’ll run out and get you one.
Rachel, Oh  you guys are so great.
Monica, Oh  wait a minute! Who’s is the father?!
Phoebe, Oh no  she won’t tell us.
Monica, Oh  come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.
Rachel, Wh—Hey  I just gave you peeing on a stick.
Phoebe, See? This is why you register.
Ross, It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look  I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh…  Hi.
Ross, Umm  would you like to dance?
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Oh great! 
Ross, I wasn’t farting!  Uh  a little game from our table.  Yes?
Ross, Oh umm  well uh  maybe-maybe later. Right now  I’m about to dance with this lady.
Ross, Uh  unless! Unless  uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.
Ross, Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey  why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.
Ross, Yeah? Hop on.  Is the pretty lady looking?
Ross, Keep dancing.
Chandler, And the world will never know.
Joey, Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Chandler, Yes  I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
Joey, No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.
Chandler, But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Joey, Hey!
Ross, No-no  thank you Miranda.
Ross, All right. 
Ross, Oh-oh  were you  were you watching?
Ross, What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Ross, I am so gonna score.
Ross, I like your bow.
Joey,"  I’d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler  the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now  my when I first found out they were getting married I was  I was a little angry. I was like   ""Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"" But then I thought back over all our memories together  some happy memories.  And-and there was some sad memories.  I’m sorry. And-and some scared memories—Whoa!  Eh? And then  and then I realized I’ll always be their friend  their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.  Oh! To the happy couple!"
Ross,  That was very nice Ashley.
Ross, No-no. 
Ross, Oh! 
Ross, Oh  you-you sure?  Okay.  Okay. So what’s uh  what’s your name.
Ross, That’s  that’s pretty.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?
Ross, Okay.  Hop on Gert. 
Ross, I’m trying. 
Ross, Maybe I should stand on your feet! 
Joey, So did you uh  happen to catch my toast up there?
Joey, Well  I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look  I know you’re casting for this new show…
Joey, Oh  see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there  just-just try me.
Joey, Well I’m not proud of this  but… 
Monica, Hey  are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Chandler, Did it turn into sand?
Monica, Ohh come on  I love this song! Come on  you’ll be fine. 
Chandler,  No. No  I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See  for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Monica, Oh sweetie  you can never embarrass me.  Okay  you can easily embarrass me. But come on  it doesn’t matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on.  Just try not to move your feet at all.  There you go.
Chandler, Why?
Rachel, How much longer?
Phoebe, 30 seconds.
Rachel, 30 seconds  okay.
Monica,  Did I miss it?  Rachel  I-I want you to know that  if it’s positive  we’re gonna…
Rachel, Oh I know. I know. 
Phoebe, It’s time.
Monica, Go ahead Rach.
Rachel, Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t  I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me  somebody tell me.
Phoebe, Okay.
Rachel, Okay.
Phoebe, Umm  it’s negative.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, It’s negative.
Rachel, Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew!  That is—that’s great—that is really great-great news.  Y’know ‘cause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects  all that. Whew. Wow  this is so just the way it was supposed to be.  God.
Monica, Well… Well  great.
Phoebe, Here. 
Rachel, Thanks.  God this is so stupid!  How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?
Phoebe, No  it’s positive.
Rachel, What?!
Phoebe, It’s-it’s not negative  it’s positive.
Rachel, Are you sure?
Phoebe, Well yeah  I lied before.
Rachel, Oh!
Monica, Oh God…
Phoebe, Now you know how you really feel about it.
Rachel, Oh-oh  that’s a risky little game!
Monica, Are you really gonna do this?
Rachel, Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby! 
Phoebe, With who?
Rachel, Ah  it’s still not the time.
Ross, I just didn’t see the fast song coming.
Joey, Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk  we’ll get you up to your room  we’ll soak your feet  you’ll be okay.
Ross, Oh  thank you.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Tell me about it  I feel like I’m holding down the fort all by myself.
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?! 
Rachel, Listen y’know what sir? For the last time  I don’t care what the computer says  we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!
Joey,  Hey!
Phoebe, Oh! Joey uh  were you in our room last night?
Joey, No.  I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
Chandler,  Hi! We’re checking out of the bridal suite.
Monica,  That’s right. I’m no longer a bride. I’ll never be a bride again. Now  I’m just someone’s wife!
Chandler, And I’m the happiest guy in the world!  Oh honey  come on don’t be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Monica, Oh yeah  right. 
Chandler, We got the honeymoon.
Monica, That’s not ‘til Thursday.
Chandler, The wedding pictures?
Monica, They won’t be ready for weeks.
Chandler, Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Monica, That’s true!  I knew I married you for a reason!
Chandler, I’ll tell you what  I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, What? What did you take a picture of?
Joey, Nothing! It was something.
Chandler, Okay Ross has the cameras  has he checked out yet?
Rachel, Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.
Chandler, Oh.
Monica, Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
Rachel, Yeah  one time  when we were dating  uh we got a late checkout  he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know  he screamed out Radisson at the end.
Chandler, Okay  well I’m gonna get Ross  get the cameras  and get them developed.  32 Joe. You’re 32! 
Monica, Oh thanks.  Champagne  strawberries…Oh my God! I can’t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!
Joey, Yeah  that’s sad. Mashuga nut?
Ross, Hi.
Chandler, Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Ross, Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.
Chandler, Yeah but you don’t need——What is this?
Ross, Thread!
Chandler, Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
Ross, What disposable cameras?
Chandler, The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
Ross, No you didn’t.
Chandler, Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake  I went up to you and I said…
Ross," Oh-oh yeah  you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor  and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said  ""Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?""  Yeah  then you did that."
Chandler, So you don’t have the cameras?!
Ross, No. Sorry man.
Chandler, So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
Ross, Well  I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.
Chandler, Great.
Ross, In-in three minutes.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
Monica, No!  But  they’re callin’ out to me! I mean this little guy  even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on  Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
Phoebe, A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.
Monica, A tiny salt shaker!!!
Phoebe, Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!
Monica, Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Phoebe, Oh yeah.
Monica, Good. Okay  I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Whew. Although y’know  this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Phoebe, Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know  it’s probably this one. 
Monica, Or this one! 
Rachel,  Hi.
Monica, Hey  how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?
Rachel, Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
Monica, No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.
Phoebe, Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy  I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.
Rachel, Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours  ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
Phoebe, Ooh  is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?
Rachel, Ew! No!
Phoebe, What?! I think he’s cute.
Rachel, Well then you have his baby.
Phoebe, Believe me I’m trying.
Monica, Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean  you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.
Phoebe, Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check  or the raw sexual magnetism.
Rachel, Yeah. Uh-huh  I guess it is pretty big news.
Phoebe, Pretty big? It’s huge! God  this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking  ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.
Rachel, Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean  I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
Phoebe, Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking  ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!
Monica, What was that bam?
Phoebe, I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey Joey  what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
Joey,  Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call!  I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
Rachel, Oh Joey! Joey! No  it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!
Joey, Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?
Phoebe, Oh yeah. That’s me.
Joey, Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
Phoebe, Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God  I’m gonna have a baby! 
Joey, Whoa  wait a minute. Who’s the father?
Phoebe, You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. 
Joey, Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
Phoebe, David Lynn.
Joey, David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! 
Monica, Who’s David Lynn?
Phoebe, Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.
Ross, Chandler?
Chandler, Hey! Did you find the cameras?
Ross, No. Did you?
Chandler, Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
Ross, Well I checked in the uh  lost and found  I talked to the manager  no-one’s turned them.
Chandler, Well this is great. Y’know  those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today  she’s really depressed.
Ross, Now you guys just got married  why is she so depressed?
Chandler, All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
Ross, I’m sorry man.  Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.
Chandler, Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
Ross, No-no-no  I’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop  throw our tuxes back on  and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.
Chandler, Are you serious?
Ross, I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?
Chandler, Marriage advice? Really?!
Ross, I’m telling you  this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?
Chandler, I don’t know  Monica picked out the flowers.
Ross, What about the chairs?
Chandler, She picked those out too.
Ross, How about the place settings?
Chandler, That was her.
Ross, What did you do?
Chandler, I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Ross, Hmm. 
Phoebe, Hey! Ooh  did you do it yet?
Rachel, Not yet.
Phoebe, Oh  well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?  Is it Gunther?
Rachel, No! Phoebe  it’s not Gunther.
Phoebe, Thank God  ‘cause that hair on a baby…
Rachel, Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
Phoebe, Why not?
Rachel, I don’t know  let me think. I was walking down the street thinking  ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
Phoebe, Bus?
Rachel, No  you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
Phoebe, Well-well but it is huge.
Rachel, I know  but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
Phoebe, You’re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. It’s like  it’s like ripping off this Band-Aid.  Quick and painless  watch.  Oh mother of…See?
Joey,  Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
Monica, No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey  you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say  no matter what I do  please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Joey, Okay.
Monica, Give me one more.
Joey, Okay. 
Phoebe,  Hey.
Joey, Oh good  uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.
Phoebe, All right. 
Joey, Umm  now uh… It’s a scary world out there  especially for a single mom. Y’know  now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay  will you marry me?
Monica, Oh my God! Joey!
Phoebe, Hell yeah! I’ll marry you! 
Monica, You can’t marry him!
Phoebe, Hey lady  your day’s over! It’s my turn!
Monica, Phoebe!
Joey, Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!
Phoebe, I can and I will! 
Monica, She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.
Joey, Oh my God.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!
Phoebe, It’s Joey! 
Joey,  Now I can’t believe it! What? Rachel’s pregnant?  Who’s the father?
Phoebe, We don’t know.
Joey, Ohh… I wonder if that dude.
Monica, There’s a dude?
Joey, Yeah.
Phoebe, Who? Who is it?
Joey, About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel  I didn’t see who it was but… 
Phoebe, Was that story over?
Joey, The guy left this.
Phoebe,  Oh my God! I know who the father is… 
Monica, People have got to finish their stories!
Chandler,  Uh  excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
Chandler, Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!
Ross, I heard it. I heard it.
Chandler, Oh yeah. I’ll take  I’ll take your picture. 
Chandler, Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
Phoebe, Look  I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before  so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!
Rachel, What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe  how do you even know who the father is?
Phoebe, I may play the fool at times  but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.  I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Rachel, Oh God… Oh  he’s in there right now?
Phoebe, Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Rachel, Uh  let’s rip!
Phoebe, Really? Are you sure?
Rachel, Oh Phoebe!
Phoebe, Okay  sorry. Yeah. 
Chandler, Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
Ross, Okay. Okay!
Ross, Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Ross, A ’95 LeSabre?!
Ross, A green LeSabre?
Ross, I’m sorry  I meant a blue LeSabre.
Ross, Well go! Go move it! 
Chandler, Okay  you ready for the last picture?
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Get ready to run.  Congratulations on your wedding. 
Phoebe, Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm  I believe that this is your red sweater.
Phoebe, Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay. 
Rachel, Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot  are you involved in some kind of dare?
Rachel, Oh  it’s just not the right time.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Tag…
Rachel, I’m having a baby.
Rachel, You can go.
Monica,  I don’t know how any of these got opened?!
Joey,  You opened them all?
Monica, I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean  Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Joey, Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift! 
Monica, Yeah. What is that?
Joey, Well  I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.
Monica, Hey! How’d it go?
Joey, Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Rachel, Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Joey, I do Rach. I do  and I so happy for you. 
Rachel, Oh wow  you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
Monica, So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
Rachel, No  I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
Joey, Hey Rach listen  no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.
Rachel, I’m not?
Joey, Listen I uh…  It’s a scary world out there especially if you’re a single mom. Y’know  I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y’know? So   Rachel Green will you marry me?
Rachel, What?
Monica, What?!
Phoebe, What?!!
Joey, Pheebs  give me the ring back!
Phoebe, No!!
Rachel, No! Joey  oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet  honey. But I’m not  I’m not looking for a husband.
Joey,  I understand.
Rachel, Now  if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. 
Phoebe, I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, Uh yeah. Pheebs  listen about that. I only offered…
Phoebe, Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
Joey, There you go!
Chandler, We’re back!
Monica, Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen!  Let’s stay in the kitchen!
Chandler, It’s picture time.
Ross, Now you are going to love these.
Chandler,  Here’s a picture of Ross.  And that’s me.  And that’s me and Ross.  Oh-ho  that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Monica, Wow! That is a great picture!
Chandler, Eh?
Monica, Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! 
Ross, Huh  didn’t see that coming.
Chandler, Okay  so this isn’t a picture of our first  but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
Monica, That would be a good idea.
Chandler, Okay.  You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
Monica, You kissed another woman!
Chandler, Call it even?!
Monica, Okay! 
Ross, Well  I’m gonna go get these  in some water.
Phoebe, Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
Ross, No-no  I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah  they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts  they got another think coming.  Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
Joey,  Oh my God!
Ross, Hey! How you doing?
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Oh hey  right back at ya.
Ross, Yeah. She—Well  she’s one crazy lady?
Ross,  Umm  I don’t some Italian guy. Come on  read your own label. See you later.
Ross, He is so weird.
Chandler, Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?
Monica, Yeah I am!
Chandler,  Bermuda  Bahama  come on pretty mama…
Monica, That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.
Joey,  Hey!
Phoebe, Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!
Chandler, I’d better go pack.
Monica, Oh no  I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.
Chandler, A Speedo? Uh  I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. 
Rachel,  Oh good you’re still here!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! 
Monica, Thank you.
Rachel, And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.  What? What? What?
Joey, We know its Ross!
Rachel, How?! How do you know?
Phoebe, It was his sweater  but—Oh my God!
Rachel, Oh  I so wanted Ross to know first  but I’m so relieved you guys know.
Monica, This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!
Rachel, I know! 
Phoebe, Me too! 
Joey, I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here! 
Rachel,  You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Monica, Yeah  but I’m the only one related by blood.
Rachel, Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
Monica, Well  what were you gonna say?
Rachel, Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
Joey, Well that  that sounds good.
Rachel, Yeah but how do I start? I mean  what’s-what’s the first thing that I say?  Okay great! Thanks. 
Monica, Hey! Good luck!
Phoebe, Yeah  bye.
Joey, Bye.
Chandler,  Hey  what was that all about?
Monica, Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now  Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Chandler,  What?! I didn’t even know that—Why didn’t you tell me?!  Why am I talking like this?!
Monica, I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
Chandler,  What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Joey, What secrets?
Chandler, Oh no-no Joey  I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
Joey,  You’ll tell me later?
Chandler, You already know.
Phoebe, Oh  it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Joey, Y’know  Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
Phoebe, All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Joey, I don’t have a key  they took mine to give to you.
Phoebe, What?! They took mine to give to you!
Joey, Why would they take away our keys?
Phoebe, Maybe they don’t trust us.
Joey, No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
Phoebe, You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?
Joey, Hey  I washed those!
Phoebe, No you didn’t.
Joey, Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
Phoebe, Well  what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Joey, Yeah  I have stuff in there too.
Phoebe, What stuff?
Joey, Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it.  Hey Mr. Treeger  it’s Joey Tribbiani. Listen  I need to get into Monica and Chandler’s apartment. It’s an emergency.  Uhh  gas leak! Yeah oh  and bring garlic bread. 
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe, Did Rachel find you?
Ross, No why?
Phoebe, Oh she was looking for you.
Ross, Oh well  I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
Phoebe, Well  she really wanted to talk to you now.
Joey, Yeah  it seemed pretty important.
Ross, Oh no.
Phoebe, What?
Ross, I think I might know what this is about.
Joey, Really?
Ross, Yeah. Uh  uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh  about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
Phoebe,  And?
Ross, Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Phoebe, Oh sorry.  And?!
Ross, Well  we-we said we’d just do it that one time but  but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Joey, Yeah  I don’t think that’s what it is.
Ross, Why? What-what else could it be?
Joey, Oh wow  I don’t feel well.
Ross, I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
Phoebe,  Maybe it’s something you ate?
Joey, Please  just-just  just go and talk to Rachel.
Ross, Yeah  I guess I should.  Man  y’know what I have to realize? Maybe I’m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Y’know  they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. 
Monica, They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
Chandler, Oh honey  leave them alone  they’re in love.
Monica, I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Monica,"  Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said  ""Next."""
Monica,  Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.
Chandler, We are on our honeymoon.
Monica, Grab my ass!
Monica, Hi  sorry. I almost didn’t hear you  because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.
Monica, Oh no  you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm  can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
Monica, You see  if we’d gone around them like I said  we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
Chandler, 25J and K  any chance those aren’t together?
Joey, I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
Phoebe, Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
Joey, What the hell is that?
Joey, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger  what are you doing?
Phoebe, Well why don’t you use your key?
Phoebe, Oh! We could have done that.
Monica, Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
Chandler, No.
Monica, Me neither! We have to get in! 
Chandler, Just act like you belong.
Monica, Oh my God! Oranges!
Chandler, Shh!  Nice to see you again. 
Chandler, Yes  of course. 
Chandler, Oh that’s all right  I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
Chandler, Apology accepted. Excuse us. 
Monica, Fine.  Go! Go! Go!
Rachel,  Hi!
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi.  Umm  I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.
Ross,  I think we do. Why don’t we go inside?  Look uh  I know why you’re here.
Rachel, You do?
Ross, Yeah  and to save you from any embarrassment umm  I think maybe I should talk first.
Rachel,  Okay.
Ross, Okay.  Uh  Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
Rachel,  What?
Ross, I mean look  that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate  but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
Rachel, Seriously. What?!
Ross, Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to  we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact  I have some time right now.
Rachel, Okay  y’know what? Can I  can I talk now?
Ross, Oh sure. 
Rachel,  I’m pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay  whenever you’re ready.  And you’re the father by the way—but you got that…
Rachel,  Can I get you some water?
Ross, I’m good. I’m good.
Rachel, Ross  there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. 
Ross, Yeah  I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand  umm  how this happened? We-we used a condom.
Rachel, I know. I know  but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.
Ross, What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Rachel, They do!
Ross, No they don’t!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Rachel, Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.
Ross, Oh well I may as well have!
Rachel, Listen  y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…
Ross, Freaked out? Hey no  I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
Rachel, Y’know what? Let’s  let’s talk later.
Ross, No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact   I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Rachel, Okay  y’know maybe I should come back… 
Ross,  Shh! Shh! Shh!
Rachel,  Okay.
Ross,  Yeah I’ll press 1! 
Joey,  Huh. So then I can heat this up? 
Phoebe, Oh great! And listen  could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm  they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Phoebe, Oh no.
Ross, Hi.
Ross, Sure.
Ross, Namaste. 
Ross, Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Joey, So it’s noticeable huh?
Ross, Look  is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Phoebe, Didn’t you two already talk?
Ross, Yeah but uh… Okay  okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together  but there’s something else.  Rachel’s pregnant.
Joey,  Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!
Phoebe,  Holy mother of God!!!
Ross, With my child.
Phoebe, That is brand new information!!
Ross, You already know don’t you?
Phoebe, A little bit.
Joey, How are you doing?
Ross, Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
Joey, Well  what did you say to her?
Ross, Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Phoebe, Oh Ross.
Ross, But hey  in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Joey,  What?
Ross, I gotta go find her.
Joey, Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Ross, Evidently they do.
Joey, What?! 
Monica, I can’t believe we’re here.
Chandler, Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
Monica, What? 
Monica, No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Chandler, We’re you just ten seconds later!
Monica, Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!
Chandler,  We need the stuff.
Joey, Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh  Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.
Monica, What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas!
Chandler, What else is new?
Joey, Yeah and we’d go check it out  but you took away our keys.
Monica, Well do something! Get in there!
Joey, How? I guess I could break down your door.
Monica, Yeah! Do that!
Joey, And-and you won’t blame us for any damage? 
Monica, No!  Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
Joey, Uh  okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down. 
Phoebe, Oh hey hi  he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door.  Okay  we’re in. 
Rachel,  If I said I was  would you judge me?
Rachel, Okay.  Oh man  I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…
Ross, Hi!
Rachel,  Hi!
Ross, Uh we-we need to talk.
Rachel, Uh-uh-uh  right now? Because I’ve kinda got an el fresco situation going on over here.
Ross, Please  please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Rachel, Okay Ross that’s fine  but can you please stand near my head?
Ross, What? Oh yeah.  I’m sorry. I mean I-I think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I  really—I should have been thinking about you Rach…
Rachel, Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Ross, Right! Right! I just—I want you to know that I’m going to be there through this whole thing  okay? Okay? The doctor’s appointments  the uh  the Lamaze classes  uh baby-proofing the apartment—Although we could probably worry about that ‘til after we get married.
Rachel, What married?
Ross, Well yeah  I think we should get married.
Rachel, What  because that’s your answer to everything?
Ross, No  because that’s the right thing to do.
Rachel, Yeah  maybe if you’re in love. But Ross  we are not in love  are we?
Ross, No but…but still you can’t possibly do this alone.
Rachel, Excuse me?
Ross, Come on Rach  you can’t even eat alone in a restaurant.
Rachel, What?!
Ross, I’m just saying if you can’t eat by yourself  how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
Rachel, I can too eat by myself!
Ross, When have you ever?
Rachel, When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Ross, Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Rachel, Oh please  you inhale your food!
Ross, I grew up with Monica! If you didn’t eat fast you didn’t eat!!
Rachel, Oh no Dr. Long  please come in. This is Ross  he is the father.
Ross, But not the husband  because evidently she can do this alone.
Ross,  I don’t know why you can’t admit that you need me.
Rachel, I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Ross, Oh my God.
Rachel, Wow. There it is  I see it.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Thank you.
Ross, Pretty amazing huh?
Rachel, I don’t see it!
Ross, What? What?!
Rachel, I can’t see it!
Ross, You-you just said that you did!
Rachel, I know  I lied! I didn’t want her to think I was a terrible mother! I can’t even see my own baby!
Ross, Oh sure  come here!  Sure you can! Uh  look come here look   it’s-it’s-it’s  it’s right there .
Rachel, Oh. Oh  it’s beautiful. I see it now.
Ross, Do you really?
Rachel, No  I don’t see it!
Ross, Come on! Come on! Here  okay-okay  you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Sweetie that’s it.
Rachel, That’s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh  thank you.
Ross, You’re welcome.
Rachel, Wow! I can’t believe that’s our baby.
Ross, Yeah  that’s our baby.
Rachel, Hi.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! So how was the doctor?
Rachel, Oh  everything went great.
Phoebe, Good.
Ross, Oh hey  show them the picture of your uterus.
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, I don’t see the baby. Where is it?
Rachel, Oh no  I know I couldn’t see it either at first  but it’s right umm…  Ross  I lost it again.
Ross, Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Chandler, Wait. Before we go in  I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon  and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
Monica, You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh? 
Phoebe, Hi!
Joey, Hey! You’re back! 
Monica, Hi sweetie!
Phoebe, Come on in!
Phoebe, So how was the honeymoon?
Monica, Oh  so much fun. But the best part is  we met this incredible couple on the way back.
Phoebe, That was the best part?  Good honeymooning tiger.
Monica, No  they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Chandler, They’re terrific  and they live right here in the city.
Monica, Yeah  can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Chandler, I’m sorry  we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
Monica, I know.
Joey, A couple? Like two people? Like  one   two people?
Monica, This is different! Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Phoebe, Oh  Greg and Jenny yuck!  Hi Greg  I’m Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica  this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.
Chandler, Listen  they are really great. If you just got a chance…
Joey, Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
Chandler, We really…didn’t get a chance to…
Phoebe, You have got to be kidding me!
Monica, We didn’t get anything for anyone.
Joey, Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
Monica, That you can have.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hello!
Rachel, Welcome home.
Ross, So  how was the honeymoon?
Monica, It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!
Rachel, Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!
Monica, Oh great! 
Chandler, Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
Monica, All right  so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean  when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Phoebe, Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
Rachel, Well it happened about six weeks ago  and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.
Joey, You’re welcome buddy.
Ross,  Yeah  thanks. 
Rachel, And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross  nice guy that he is  offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine  we got to talking  and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
Ross,  Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
Rachel, What is?
Ross, The lie you just told.
Rachel, That-that you came on to me?
Ross, There’s the one!
Rachel, But you did! I mean  let’s be honest.
Ross, Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh  it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that  is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
Joey, Whom.  That’s right.
Rachel, You know you kissed me first.
Ross, What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
Rachel, I was sending you signals?
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, Oh please. Okay  anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols  please show of hands. 
Ross, Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Rachel, Okay. So these signals Ross  explain this to me  ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean  am I sending you these signals right now?
Ross, Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel  just-just drop it.
Rachel, No please  show me how I begged you!
Ross, I can show you  I have it on videotape!  It’s an expression.
Phoebe, I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!
Joey, Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Chandler, Y’know who has a great video camera?
Phoebe,  Greg and Jenny?
Monica, Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
Chandler, Let’s call ‘em.
Joey, Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Monica,  Hello?  Eighth street deli?
Joey, Hey  hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
Monica,  Uh sorry  wrong number. 
Chandler, Here you go. 
Monica,  Hello?   It’s the deli again!
Joey, All right! I’ll have a sandwich!
Monica,  I don’t think this number’s right!
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, You got fake numbered.
Monica, What?! People don’t do that!
Joey, Oh I think we do.
Monica, They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Chandler, I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful  great questions.
Monica, And you’ve never been funnier. Joke  joke  joke  you were a hoot!
Joey, Y’know what? Don’t worry about it  you still got me and Phoebe.
Phoebe, Excuse me  I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.
Ross,  Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
Phoebe, Hmm  I wonder why. Pervert!
Ross, Okay  listen I am not a pervert!
Phoebe, That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand  put your left hand down your pants  and repeat that!
Ross, Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look  here’s what happened  and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right  about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm  a personal thing.
Joey, Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.
Ross, About…about sex?  That I hadn’t had sex in months?
Joey,  Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about.
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey.
Ross, Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m  I’m really uncomfortable talking about.
Joey, Sure. What? About uh  you showering with your mom?
Ross, I actually had a topic in mind! I’m  I’m kinda going through a dry spell  sex wise.
Joey, Whoa  for like months?
Ross, Five to be lying  six.
Joey, Six months? Whoa that’s rough.
Ross, Well  I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh  smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
Joey, The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Ross, Please  help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!
Joey, Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh  I got something. It’s this story I came up with  very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.
Ross, Really? Well then tell it to me.
Joey, Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it  but you have to remember it is just the story.
Ross,  I’ll try to control myself.
Joey, Okay.  Years ago  when I was backpacking across Western Europe…
Ross,  You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Joey, Have a nice six more months Ross! 
Ross,  Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please  please  you were in Western Europe and?
Joey, I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake  very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…
Ross,  Why?
Ross, It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm  a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross, Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um  yeah I was in Barcelona.
Ross, Anyway  umm so I was um  I was hiking…
Ross,  Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
Ross, Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Joey, Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Ross, Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Joey, Hey! Look  if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.
Ross, No! No  I don’t…don’t want to.
Joey, How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?
Ross, I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Joey, I’m not feeling it.
Ross, I was just outside Barcelona  hiking…
Joey, No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?
Ross, It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
Joey, Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look  I gotta go. I got a date  but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.
Ross, I’ll try that.
Joey, All right now… All right  you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?
Ross, Thanks.
Joey, Good luck.
Ross, Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Joey, Yeah?
Ross, Listen  if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
Joey,  That means a lot to me man. 
Ross, Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!
Rachel, Oh Ross!
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Ross, That’s less embarrassing  yes. Yes I was.
Ross,  So when she came in  I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.  It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Chandler, Yeah  we’re gonna need to see that tape. 
Monica, Yeah  definitely.
Ross, What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Joey, Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!
Ross, Thank you.  No!
Joey, You’re right. 
Ross, Joey! No!
Joey, Loud and clear! 
Monica, I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Joey, Y’know  if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.
Monica, Okay  maybe people give out fake numbers  but they don’t give out fake names.
Joey, Oh yeah?  Hi  Ken Adams  nice to meet you.
Phoebe, Regina Philange. 
Chandler, I still don’t get it  we didn’t do anything wrong.
Monica, I know! Although  you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
Chandler, I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Monica,  Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! 
Chandler, Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Monica, What about my questions?
Chandler, The sheer volume  it was like flying with the Riddler!
Monica, Oh  I’m sorry. Was that another joke?
Chandler,  Was that another question?
Rachel,  Hey! Is Ross still here?
Joey, Uh no Rach  he’s gone. But listen  he told us what happened and it does  it sounds like an honest mistake.
Rachel, Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh forget it!  Oh there he is now  the father of my child  the porn king of the west village.
Ross, Look  it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened  but I swear  I didn’t even watch it! Anyway  here.  I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. 
Rachel, Thank you.  What?  You don’t want to see this do you?
Monica, Hell yeah!!!
Rachel, I am not gonna show you this!
Phoebe, No! Not the sex part  just the stuff leading up to it.
Ross, Forget it  she’s destroying it.
Phoebe, Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who ’ thing to rest! Come on now  think!!
Ross, Look  forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So  end of story.
Rachel, I wanna see it.
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either  but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
Joey,  Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
Ross, I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
Rachel, Ahh  I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. 
Ross, Rachel  please…
Rachel, Ah  a little preview!
Ross, Fine. Fine  but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road  because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…
Rachel, Okay  here we go. 
Ross,  Hello! Can I get you anything?
Joey,  I’m so happy!
Rachel,  Oh  thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
Rachel, There I am.
Phoebe, You’re gonna get pregnant.
Rachel,  I screwed up so bad  I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…
Ross,  You didn’t do it?
Rachel,  I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.
Monica,  Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.
Rachel, Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.
Monica, I know.
Rachel,"   I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it!  ""Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please  drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!""  Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…"
Chandler, Did you do it on our invitations?!
Ross,  Not on the ones we sent out.
Chandler, So  just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! 
Rachel,  Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
Ross,  I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh  you and I almost…
Rachel,  Oh  I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know  if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?
Ross,  I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just  I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
Rachel,  Oh I wanted to.
Ross,  So we…we both wanted to.
Rachel,  Interesting.
Ross,  Yeah.  Anyway umm  it probably worked out for the best.
Rachel,  Oh yeah  sure.
Rachel, Okay  in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.
Ross, And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
Rachel,  Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
Rachel, Okay  get ready to see some beggin’!
Phoebe, Oh  you came on to Ross!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Now I’m so happy.
Rachel, What are you talking about?!
Monica, You used the Europe story!
Chandler, That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
Rachel, How do you know about that story?!
Joey, How do you know about that story?!
Rachel, I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Joey,  Some guy!! 
Rachel, No. No  she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Joey,  Ken Adams!!
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, So uh  apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Ross, Yeah. Listen about that  the whole uh  who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean  I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.
Rachel, It was an amazing night.
Ross, It was. It was an amazing night.
Rachel, You think it looked amazing?
Ross, I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.
Rachel, Yeah  me neither. Yet…
Ross, Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.
Rachel, Yeah  it would be really weird.
Ross, Good luck.
Rachel, Good luck to you.
Ross, Mind if I mute?
Rachel, Oh please. 
Ross, Oh  oh there go the clothes.
Rachel, You are undressing very quickly.
Ross, Six months Rachel  six months.
Ross, Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.
Rachel, That’s what I was gonna say.
Ross, Oh nice tan!
Rachel, Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Ross, Ah….
Rachel, Have you been working out?
Ross, I have been working out.
Rachel, Really? Wow  this is so much better than I…
Ross, Oh that’s not pretty.
Rachel, Oh! Oh!
Ross, No!
Rachel, Oh God!
Ross, Oh no!
Rachel, Oh  make it stop!
Ross, Oh no!!
Rachel, Make it stop!!
Ross, No!!
Rachel, Have to make it stop!!
Ross, No!!!
Monica,  Hello Greg?  Hi  this is Monica from the plane? Listen  the number that you gave me 853-5…   That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!
Chandler, Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Monica,  Hey listen umm  how would you like to get together? Say next Saturday?  Okay  how about Sunday?  Okay umm  the week after that?  The week after that?  Y’know what Greg? Y’know what?

Monica, Okay!
Phoebe,  Oh  well hello there.
Phoebe,  I didn’t see this on the menu.
Monica, Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim  my new sous chef.
Phoebe, Oh  so you're Monica’s boss?
Phoebe, Oh! I sous stand.
Monica, Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm  could you get me the pesto?
Phoebe, Oh you…you made pesto?
Phoebe, Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Monica, All right  I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
Phoebe, I made it myself.
Phoebe, Well  it’s no pesto.
Monica, All right  all right! Let’s just cut to the chase  okay?  You’re single.  You’re single.  He gets off work at eleven.  She’ll be waiting for your call.  I’ll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!!  I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Chandler, You know me sir. Oh ah  I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Chandler, What’s funny about that?
Ross,  Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Chandler, Hey that’s okay. So  where do you want to go?
Ross, Oh ah  I think you know where I want to go.
Chandler, The Hard Rock Caf�?
Ross, Yeah!
Chandler, Again?!
Ross, Yeah!!
Ross, I’m telling you  I like the food!
Chandler, You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob.
Ross, Did that guy just call you Toby?
Chandler, Yeah  he thinks that’s my name.
Ross, Well  why don’t you correct him?
Chandler," Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know  I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway  so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said  ""Hey Toby  do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later  the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby."
Ross, Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
Chandler, No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides  we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse  it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel. 
Ross,  Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M  your middle name is Muriel!!
Chandler, Shh! It is a family name!
Ross, Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy  your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Joey,  Okay  let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
Rachel, Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!
Joey, I’m not telling  you’ll have to see it on TV!
Rachel, You don’t know do you?
Joey, No  couldn’t care less.
Joey, Hey you too!
Joey, What? You weren’t in it.
Rachel, Oh! 
Joey, Oh sorry. Uh-uh  Kash?
Joey, This is my friend Rachel. Rachel  Kash  Kash  Rachel.
Rachel, Hi.
Rachel, Well  Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know  he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh  your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.  And uh  and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that  I’m just stroking your arm.
Joey,  Here we go! Here we go! 
Rachel, Oh  we’re leaving. Bye Kash.
Rachel, Say hi to Wally.
Phoebe, Ooh Monica!
Monica, Hi!
Phoebe, Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh  I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.
Monica, I…I have to fire him.
Phoebe, But why?!
Monica, Because he’s terrible! Okay  he’s slow  he burns things  last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Phoebe, Well maybe he was just nervous  y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Monica, Well  now she has no eyebrows  mission accomplished.
Phoebe, But Monica  he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
Monica,  All right  but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
Phoebe, That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops  it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
Monica, I paid to have this done.
Phoebe, Love it!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Oh you know uh Kash  really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
Rachel, I thought I was a complete idiot.
Joey, Hey  I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.
Rachel, Oh! Oh  I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
Joey, I said no.
Rachel, What?!
Joey, What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.
Rachel, Okay Joey  first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all  what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
Joey, I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
Rachel, Good-good  don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Joey, Rach look  I really don’t think that’s such a great…
Rachel, Okay  you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
Chandler, Hey Bob.
Chandler, If I see him  I’ll ask.
Chandler, Yeah!
Chandler, We’re on a semi-first name basis.
Chandler, Bob? Ooh  working here with us? Everyday? Yeah  I don’t know if he has what it takes.
Chandler, But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.
Chandler, I think it’s best sir.
Chandler, Y’know what you should do  just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.
Chandler, What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey. Okay  I gave him another chance  but Tim has got to go!
Phoebe, But…
Monica," No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said  ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""
Phoebe, Okay. Okay  but you can’t fire him today.
Monica, Why not?!
Phoebe, Because I’m dumping him today.
Monica, What?! You said he was sweet!
Phoebe," He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"""
Monica, Just don’t pick up your phone.
Phoebe," Then he comes over!  ""I’m so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"
Monica, What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
Phoebe, You can’t fire him and dump him the same day  he’ll kill himself.
Monica, Okay well then  I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Phoebe, Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip  I’ll kill myself!
Monica, Okay well  then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!
Phoebe, Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
Monica, What do you mean?
Phoebe, Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped  bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired  blond bitch!
Monica, I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Phoebe, All right  that makes sense.  Ugh. But—Screw you I’m going first! 
Chandler, Sure  what’s up?
Rachel," Hey  what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm  I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon "" or ""I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"""
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, So  what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Joey, No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Ross, Rach? You wanna come?
Rachel, Oh no  I can’t. I got a date.
Ross, A date?
Rachel, Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
Ross, Why no  it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh  regular. It’s-it’s uh  it’s mundane. It’s actually uh  a little dull.
Joey, It’s no Ukrainian film.
Rachel, Yeah—Ooh! Earrings! 
Ross, A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
Joey, I set her up with this actor on my show.
Ross, You set her up?!
Joey, No
Ross, Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Joey, Well  I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
Ross, Joey  I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
Joey, Hey! I’m an  actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Ross, A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Joey, Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Ross, Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
Joey, Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross  this is Kash.
Ross, Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
Ross, A bit of a daredevil are we?
Rachel,  Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!
Rachel, Yeah! All right  I’ll see you guys later.
Ross, Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Rachel, Thank you.
Ross, Yes it is too slutty! 
Phoebe, Hi.
Phoebe, It will be…in a minute. Listen  Tim you’re a really great guy.
Phoebe, Aw.  I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
Phoebe, Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
Joey, So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
Ross, Books?
Joey, All right  car magazines  cereal boxes  but it’s like enough!
Ross, Well  I tell you what. Why don’t we uh  why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie  we’ll just hang.
Joey, And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Ross, Hey  if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
Joey, Dude! What is going on?!
Ross, I just…I have to find out how it went.
Joey, Why?
Ross, This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
Joey, They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!
Ross, I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
Joey, Well Ross  what did you think she was gonna do?
Ross, I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
Joey, What do you mean?
Ross, It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben  but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s  it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and  my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
Joey, That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Ross, No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Joey, Hey  can I ask you something? In this  in this picture of you and your wife  is your wife Rachel?
Ross, It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
Joey, Good call. Yeah. But  the face Ross  the face isn’t Rachel.
Ross, No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
Joey, I know  but I don’t think that’s what she wants.
Ross, No  it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
Joey, That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought  but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby  your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, Hey  I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
Ross,  We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Joey, No  I said fun!
Chandler, Hey Bobby.
Chandler, Uhh yeah. Yeah  it’s  right  right down there.  Right there  yeah. Can I ask you why?
Chandler, Okay Bob listen uhh  I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
Chandler, Bob!
Chandler, Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Monica, Hey.
Monica, Uh well that depends  how are things with Phoebe?
Monica, Oh my pleasure. Okay  I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.  Phoebe!
Phoebe, Monica!
Monica,  You’re fired!
Phoebe,  I’m breaking up with you!
Phoebe, I’m  I’m breaking up with you.
Monica, You’re fired.
Phoebe, I’m sorry  I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.
Monica, Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But  well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.
Phoebe, Oh that’s good  the chemistry thing for us too.
Monica, Tim wait!
Monica, Umm  I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
Monica, Yeah.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, And Tim I just wanna say  good luck here. 
Ross, Hello.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Well  how was the date?
Rachel, Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars  what do you think?
Ross, Uh-huh. What happened?
Rachel, I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Ross, Ah  he didn’t uh  take it so well?
Rachel, Well better than you  but y’know still not what you want.
Ross, Oh?
Rachel," He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh  ""Yeah  I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."""
Ross, He sounds swell.
Rachel, Doesn’t he?
Ross, Hey  wanna…wanna a little cheering up?
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, Sit down.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Rachel,  Chandler M. Bing?
Ross, Yeah-ha!
Rachel, Oh my God. 
Ross, I’m sorry about your date.
Rachel, Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Ross, Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um  in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh  wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
Rachel, Thanks sweetie.
Ross, You wanna  you wanna grab some coffee?
Rachel, Oh no  I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Ross, Hey  I thought I cheered you up.
Rachel, Oh you did  there are twenty in here.
Ross, Right. Good night.
Rachel, Good night.
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Oh hi!
Ross, Wow! Uh…how are you?
Ross, Oh that’s right. Well uh  would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Ross, Great! Well umm…
Ross, Sure! Uh  let me get it for ya.
Chandler,  Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!
Monica, Hey you guys?
Ross, What?
Monica, I know it’s last minute  but we decided to have a Halloween party.
Phoebe, Oh good! 
Monica, And everybody has to wear costumes.  Come on! It’ll be fun!
Ross, Well  I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
Rachel, Please tell me you’re not gonna dress up like a dinosaur.
Ross,  Not two years in a row.
Joey, Look  I’ll come to the party but I’m not dressing up.
Monica, You have to!
Joey, No way! Look  Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up  pretending to be someone you’re not…
Chandler, You’re an actor!
Monica, So Ross  are you gonna bring Mona?
Ross, Yeah. Yeah  I think I will.
Joey, That hot girl from their wedding?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes  she could be a bikini model  or a slutty nurse  or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh  Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
Phoebe, Now wasn’t Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
Ross, That’s right! He was hitting on her  and I got her. I guess the better man won.  Please don’t take her from me.
Phoebe, Ursula!  Wait! Err-err  it’s me! Phoebe!
Phoebe, Wait a second! So  what’s new with you?
Phoebe, What?!
Phoebe, Huh. Okay. Well  I’m really happy for you. 
Phoebe, Really?
Phoebe, Yeah. Okay. Umm  y’know  my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so  you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.
Phoebe, By the way  it’s a costume party.
Phoebe,  No. But thanks. 
Rachel, Hi!
Monica, Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!
Rachel, I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it  because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.
Monica, Oh.
Rachel, Ahh!
Monica, I’m Catwoman  who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know  ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.
Rachel,  Just a minute!!!  Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary witch. 
Rachel, And you are a very funny clown. 
Rachel,  And you are so in style right now. Y’know  I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue  but…
Rachel, Yeah. Sure. 
Phoebe, Ah  Catwoman. So we meet again.
Monica, So we do Supergirl.
Phoebe, No  it’s me. Phoebe!
Chandler,  Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen  I appreciate you getting me the costume…
Rachel,  Oh  you did this to him?
Monica, What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Chandler, The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Monica, Well  it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
Chandler, No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
Joey,  Hey!
Monica, You didn’t dress up either?!
Joey, Yes I did! I’m Chandler.  Dude  what happened?
Chandler, How is that me?
Joey, Okay. I’m Chandler 
Phoebe,  That is so you!
Chandler, When have I ever done that?!
Joey, When have I ever done that?! 
Rachel, Oh!  Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.
Rachel, Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Rachel, Well  I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Rachel, Ohh… Oh  honey here. Take it all.  Monica! We need more candy?
Monica, What?! There’s only been like four kids.
Rachel, Yeah I know  but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.
Phoebe, No wonder your pregnant.
Ross,  Hey! 
Rachel, Hey.
Monica, What are you supposed to be?
Ross, Remember the Russian satellite  Sputnik?  Well  I’m a potato or a…spud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik  becomes…  Spud-nik. Spudnik!
Chandler, Wow! I don’t have the worst costume anymore!
Joey,  Hey all right  Ross came as doody.
Ross, No  I-I’m not doody.
Monica, No  space doody!
Phoebe, Okay  I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Phoebe, Ursula’s fianc�e?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, My mother killed herself.
Phoebe, No-no! That’s okay  we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.
Phoebe, Why are you looking at me like that?
Phoebe, Okay.  So  what are you?
Phoebe,  No I-I meant your costume.
Phoebe, I love the second grade!
Phoebe, Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.
Phoebe, Umm  I’m a masseuse…by day. 
Phoebe, No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Phoebe, Thank you.
Monica, Hey Joey?
Joey, Yeah.
Monica, You read comic books right?
Joey, Exclusively.
Monica, Who do you think would win in a fight  Catwoman or Supergirl?
Joey, Catwoman  hands down.
Monica, Yeah…
Joey, But between you and Phoebe  I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Monica, What?! Really?!
Joey, Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus  she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?
Monica, No you’re fine.  All right well  do you think I could take Rachel?
Joey, I’m not sure.
Monica, What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here!  As hard as you can!
Joey, Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.
Monica, Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that  y’know  Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
Joey," I would say  ""Woman  please!"""
Phoebe,  Hey. Ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! He’s a teacher  he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know  I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!
Monica, Oh my God  Phoebe!
Phoebe, What?
Monica, You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fianc�e.
Phoebe, No I’m not! You are!
Joey,  Here comes the temper.
Rachel, Hi! Y’know what honey  we’re actually out of candy right now. But someone just went out to get some and I have been giving out money but I’m out of that too. Hey  can I write you a check?
Rachel, Okay  what’s your name?
Rachel, Okay  I’m just gonna write this out to cash.
Rachel, Hey Mona!
Chandler, Oh! Hi!
Chandler, Joey’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping you’d come by as a slutty nurse.
Chandler, You’d think that would embarrass me  but you see I’m maxed out.
Ross, Hey!
Ross, You made it!
Ross, Well  I’m a spud…
Ross, Yes!
Chandler,  Marry her.
Joey, Okay  here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.
Monica, I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.
Joey, So Ross?
Monica, Yeah.
Phoebe, Hello handsome.  Oh God.  Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Phoebe, Two weeks? That’s it?
Phoebe, Oh really?
Phoebe, Huh? 
Phoebe, Peace Corps  really? 
Chandler, Howdy doody.
Ross, That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Chandler, Oh relax man  relax. You’re looking a little flushed.
Joey,  Hey-hey-hey  I think we might find out the answer to our question.
Chandler, What question?
Joey, Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight  you or Ross?
Chandler, There’s no question.
Joey, So you think Ross too?
Chandler,  You picked Ross?!
Monica, Ross is really strong! Okay  he’s the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey.
Chandler, I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.
Ross, Uh  in her defense  she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Chandler, Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it? 
Ross, Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
Monica, Wait-wait!! Okay  stop it! Stop it! Stop!  Now listen  no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.
Joey, Hey Monica!  People came to see a fight  let’s give ‘em what they came for!
Joey, Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Chandler,  You’re going down.
Ross, Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
Joey, Seriously guys  the trash talk is embarrassing.
Rachel, Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.
Rachel, Honey  someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.
Rachel, Gotta go!  Hi! Wow! There you go! 
Rachel, Oh yeah  we were but umm  now we’ve got candy.
Rachel, Well  that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!
Rachel, Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?
Rachel, You shut up!
Rachel, Uh  I think I just did. And uh-oh  here it comes again. Shut up!
Joey, Rach?
Rachel,  Yeah I know—I’m good—I got it!   Now wait a minute  I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!
Rachel, No! Wait no! Shut up—I mean don’t cry! Let me get my checkbook! 
Monica,  Look honey  you don’t have to do this  okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal  you’re honest  and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
Chandler, That means nothing to me.  Come on!
Phoebe, Hi liar!
Phoebe, Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.
Phoebe, But they’re not!
Phoebe, Why are you lying to him?
Phoebe, You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Joey,  Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We’re waiting!   Okay. Okay guys  one match  winner take all.  Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Ross, Pride.
Chandler, And dignity.
Joey,  Okay  if you say so. All right  ready? Set! Go!
Joey, Or equally weak.
Monica,  Oh God!
Phoebe, Hmm?
Monica, Chandler’s making his sex face.
Ross,  So  you gettin’ tired?
Chandler, Nope! I can do this all day.
Ross, Yeah? Me too.  Gettin’ a little tired though.
Chandler, God  I’m exhausted.
Ross, Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona  Mona’s standing right over there.  Oh God  she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Chandler, No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!
Ross, Hey  at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin’ people up! And I’m dressed as doody.
Chandler, You’re Spudnik.
Ross, Come on  who are we kidding? I’m doody. Please? She’s watchin’.
Chandler, Fine.  Oh no!
Ross,  Oh yeah!
Joey,  You’re a weird lady.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Sure it does. Yeah  yeah.
Phoebe, Umm listen  I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Phoebe, Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
Phoebe, She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me.  Okay. Okay. Yeah—Not a prayer chain  but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.  Okay  here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher  a waitress. All right  here’s her driver license  this oughta be good  she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
Phoebe, Oh  I almost don’t want to show this.  Just remember I’m a minute younger.
Phoebe, No. You’re not  you’re not stupid.
Phoebe, That’s good  you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person.  What?
Phoebe, Yeah  you should. 
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hey! Well  I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Joey, That’s not so bad.
Rachel, No  I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh  I am just awful with children!
Joey, Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know  they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Rachel, Really? You think that’s all it is?
Joey, Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they’re hungry or sleepy. Y’know  kids are tough. Good luck with that. 
Monica, Look  I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.
Chandler, Listen  I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Monica,  Is that a secret or a lie.
Chandler, No  I let him win—Ross!
Ross, Yeah?
Chandler, Would you tell her I let you win please?
Ross, Oh. Yeah.  Uh Chandler let me win. No  Chandler’s really strong. Oh my arm is so sore. Oh nurse! 
Chandler, I am strong! I’ll show you! 
Monica, Chandler please!
Chandler, Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
Monica, Let’s go big bunny!
Chandler, Okay. 1…2…3—Go!   I’m gonna kill myself!
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh  I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
Chandler, Y’know uh  I didn’t actually do this.
Monica, Oh no  was I cleaning in my sleep again?
Chandler, No  it wasn’t you.
Monica, Well then who?
Chandler, I got a maid. Yay!
Monica,  I hope by maid you mean mistress  because if some other woman was here cleaning then…
Chandler, Uh honey  I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
Monica, Oh  relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
Chandler, Look  she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Monica, Did she really say that?
Chandler, Yes  I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance  okay?
Monica, Fine  I can do it.  Whew.
Chandler, What’s the matter?
Monica, Well  usually when I’m this anxious  I clean!
Phoebe,  Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.
Ross, I think it’s coming from your bag.
Phoebe,  I never get calls!!  Hello?
Phoebe, Oh my God Eric hi! Wait  how’d you get this number?
Phoebe, Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.
Phoebe, Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!
Rachel, Wow! What did he do?
Phoebe, Shhh! I’m talking.
Phoebe, Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
Phoebe, No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.
Phoebe, Not great  but we can work on it at lunch. Okay  I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Phoebe, I’ve got friends too. Okay  bye.
Phoebe, Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh  this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross  I can’t make lunch. 
Ross, So apparently I’m available for lunch.
Rachel, I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
Ross, You’re moving?
Rachel," Yeah  I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be   ""How you doin’?"""
Ross, So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
Rachel, Well  I haven’t discussed it with him yet  but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week  he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Ross, That’s not really porn.
Rachel, Not so much.
Ross, Hey  y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Rachel, Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Ross, Well I don’t know  but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.
Rachel, Yeah that would really be great.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
Ross, Yeah. No. No you’re right.
Rachel, Shall we?
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Rachel, And I’m Rachel  an admirer of the building.
Ross, I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
Ross, What?
Ross, Oh  thank God!
Rachel, Ahh.
Ross, Of course! Uh yeah  she and I would talk all the time in-in  the laundry room. 
Ross, Y’know I would it’s just painful.
Rachel, So she’s really not dead.
Rachel, Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in  in a one bedroom or a two?
Monica, Oh well umm  I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.
Monica,  I love her.
Monica, Okay. 
Chandler, See? I told you.
Monica, She stole my jeans!
Chandler,  What?
Monica, I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
Chandler, So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Monica, Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!
Chandler, She must’ve been planning this for years!
Monica, I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
Chandler, Honey  isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
Monica, I guess.
Chandler, So  shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
Monica, Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.
Chandler, Out of curiosity  what is your secret ingredient?
Monica, Yeah! 
Phoebe, Hi!
Phoebe, Yeah  me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Yeah.  Yeah.
Phoebe, Maybe this is too weird.
Phoebe, No don’t tear out your eyes!!
Phoebe, Oh  yeah try that.  So  is that better?
Phoebe, Look Eric  turn around.  Look  I like you  but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh  he just touched my hand  did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and……second kisses. 
Ross, Thanks for the coffee  or bedankt voor de koffie  Gunter. 
Ross, Yeah  we’re done.
Ross, Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? 
Joey,  Hey Ross! Listen  do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Ross, Really?!
Joey,  No. But I got Knicks tickets for you  me  and Chandler.
Ross, Sweet!
Joey, All right  well finish your coffee; let’s go.
Ross, Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
Joey, To tape the game? You do this every time Ross  you’re not gonna be on TV!
Ross, No-no  I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
Joey, Oh  you’re switching apartments?
Ross, It’s not for me  it’s for Rachel.
Joey, But Rachel has an apartment.
Ross, Yeah  but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.
Joey, She is?
Ross, Yeah  you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?
Joey, I guess I didn’t really think about it.
Ross,  Ezel!  Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!
Ross, Damnit!
Monica, Nice jeans!
Monica, Oh.   You’re not gettin’ it.
Monica, Oh  I fell asleep.
Monica, Oh  will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.
Monica, Hello.
Monica, I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before  is this not okay?
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, How was the game?
Joey, Oh  okay. I…I ate way too much.
Rachel, Oh.
Joey, Ooh.  So umm  I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Rachel, Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
Joey, I was kinda hoping you’d stay.
Rachel, Oh but Joey  I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.
Joey, No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.  Y’know  I mean you-you could you could put it over here.  Or-or-or we could put it right here.  Aw  it’s cute  right? Or-or we could put it over here.  You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? 
Rachel, Honey  it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.
Joey, I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.
Rachel, Honey  it’s so sweet that you want me to stay  but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
Joey, I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.
Rachel, I know.
Joey, Y’know I blame Ross for this.
Rachel, I do too a little bit.
Joey, I’m gonna miss you  you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.
Phoebe, Ooh  oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Phoebe, No  I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.
Phoebe, Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. 
Chandler,  Hi!
Monica, Hey! Umm  I think Brenda needs a raise.
Chandler, How come?
Monica, Because I put my head between her legs.
Chandler, To see her pants?
Monica, They’re my pants!
Chandler, Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
Monica, No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
Chandler, God! She is not stealing from us! Okay  will you let this go?
Monica, Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!
Chandler, Oh dear God!
Monica, My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Chandler, And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.
Monica, Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!
Chandler, Here’s another plan…No!
Monica, I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!
Chandler, Why?
Monica, Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!
Chandler, I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Monica, Do this for me! Come on  I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!
Chandler, You see that?
Monica, Do you see this? 
Chandler, All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Monica, Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look  you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup  the lacey part  there’s a very noticeable rip.
Chandler, You need new clothes.
Ross, Hi. How is she?
Ross,  Oh.  Oh. Well I uh  I brought her some bloemen. 
Ross, Oh I don’t know that it would.
Ross, All right then. 
Phoebe,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
Phoebe, Why?
Phoebe, What sex?
Phoebe, We didn’t have sex.
Phoebe,  Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Phoebe, You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!
Phoebe, You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Phoebe, Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.
Phoebe, So I guess this is it.
Phoebe, Yeah  so do you.
Chandler, I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
Chandler, Brenda a bee!
Chandler, Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
Chandler, You do?
Chandler, I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?
Rachel, Hi!
Monica,  Where did you get those jeans?!
Rachel, You gave them to me!
Monica, No I didn’t!
Rachel, All right  I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Monica, Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
Rachel, What bra?
Monica, The pink one with the flowers?!
Rachel, You mean the one that you’re wearing? 
Monica, Sounds about right.
Rachel, What is this?
Joey, Hey! Uh  this is just to give you an idea. Okay well  we can put screens here   so that the baby has privacy  and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor   which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
Rachel, You’re so sweet.  Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! 
Joey, Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? 
Rachel, But Joey the baby is going to be crying  it’s going to be loud.
Joey, I’m loud!
Rachel, It’s gonna be up all night!
Joey, I’m up all night!
Rachel, It’s gonna poop!
Joey, Hello!
Rachel, What about all the women you want to bring home?
Joey, Look  if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby  then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Rachel, Joey  are you sure?
Joey, Yeah! All right—Look  I know sometimes it’ll be hard  okay? But  it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Rachel, I want me to stay too.
Joey, Ohh!
Rachel, Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!
Joey, I know! I found it on the street.
Rachel, Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel, Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?
Joey, I don’t know.
Rachel, It’s moving.
Joey, Ew.
Rachel, It’s still——It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
Joey, Ooh! Ah! Okay! 
Ross, Well  the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care   because you got the apartment. Yes!
Rachel, Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
Joey, Isn’t that great?
Ross,  Ezels!!
Rachel,  Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe, Huh?
Rachel, I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night  do you wanna come?
Phoebe, Sure. Yeah  he’s kinda sexy.
Rachel, Oh no  no  I’ll be there too.
Phoebe, Okay so  we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.
Rachel, No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.
Phoebe, Oh. Why not?
Rachel, ‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.
Phoebe, Oh Rachel  this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’
Rachel, What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.
Phoebe, Wow! Oh well  I will be there!
Rachel, Thank you.
Phoebe, Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
Monica,  No you don’t!
Rachel,  No you don’t.
Phoebe, Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Chandler, Her what?!!
Phoebe, Your secret bachelorette party…
Chandler, You had a bachelorette party?!
Phoebe, She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!
Chandler, I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know  we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
Joey, It’s a grand tradition!
Monica, I’m sorry  they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Rachel, Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.
Joey, This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party  but no  I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Chandler, You went home with the waitress.
Joey, Oh yeah  that was a pretty good night.
Chandler, I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Monica, Ugh  I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
Phoebe, Oh  I-I don’t eat meat.
Phoebe, Yeah  I don’t eat that either.
Rachel, Well actually umm…
Rachel,  In case you didn’t notice  that is a scary man.
Phoebe, He’s right though  the ’74 is absolute piss.
Rachel, This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t  I can’t  I can’t  I can’t…
Phoebe, Rachel!
Rachel, No it’s okay  this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Phoebe, Why  so he can get mad at the baby?
Rachel, Hey  that is the…baby’s problem.  Oh  everything okay with the waiter?
Rachel, Well… Umm  I got TiVo.
Phoebe, It’s slang for pregnant.
Rachel, Phoebe!
Rachel, Well uh  yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up  yeah.
Rachel, No  it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy  I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it  this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Who?
Rachel, February 2nd!
Ross, Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Ross, Yeah  a lot of my students do that.
Ross, Okay  I-I’ll see you tonight.
Ross, Okay  bye.
Chandler, My God! You must be good in bed!
Joey, So uh  you and Mona  been a while now. How’s it going?
Ross, Ah  it’s good. It’s going good. I mean  we get along great. She’s  she’s so…
Joey, Hot?
Ross, Well  I was gonna say sweet  but yeah-huh!
Chandler, She’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
Ross, Well I…I haven’t actually told her yet. I don’t want to scare her off  y’know?
Chandler, Well  you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path  but you’re really going down different ones.
Joey, I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Monica,  Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing  so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.
Chandler, What?
Monica, Yeah  I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
Chandler, Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…
Joey, Will you let the lady talk?!
Monica, Come on! Come on  it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.
Chandler, Look  I appreciate it  but uh  it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.
Monica, So don’t think of it as a bachelor party  think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.
Ross, Sure  one year is paper  but two months is lapdance! 
Monica, Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
Chandler, All right fine! But I’m only doing this for you!
Joey, Yeah!
Chandler, And Joey.
Monica, Thank you. All right  now who else do you want to invite?
Chandler, Ah  no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Ross, Uh actually  sorry I can’t even make it. I’m seeing Mona again tonight.
Chandler, I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
Joey,  I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…
Phoebe, I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding  but I’m really busy that day. Yeah  I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
Rachel, I know. I know. I panicked  I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
Phoebe, It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
Rachel, All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this  I’m gonna tell him  I’m gonna be strong.
Rachel, Yeah?
Rachel, Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!!  Right. Daddy  I need to talk to you. Please  sit down.
Rachel, There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
Rachel, I’m sorry daddy.
Rachel, Oh now daddy  stay calm. Please.
Rachel, Yes. Yes  he says I’m damaged goods.
Joey, So you uh  nervous about getting married?
Chandler, What are you doing?
Joey, Look  look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on  it’ll be fun.
Chandler, Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
Joey, How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Chandler, You’re right  this is more fun.
Joey, That’s her! Okay  come on! 
Chandler, Hi. 
Joey, Uh  that-that’s-that’s me!
Chandler, That’s me.
Joey, Joey Tribbiani  a big fan.
Chandler, Yeah  yeah right over there.
Chandler, That was weird.
Joey, Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
Chandler, So she’s a…
Joey, Yeah  that’s one naked hooker!
Ross, Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Ross, So much more.
Ross, Aw forget it  it’s from Pier One.  Sorry. 
Ross, Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
Ross, Who did?!
Ross, Yes. Yes  yes I did.  But-but it was  it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Ross, No! No sir umm  she means a lot to me. I mean  I care—I-I love Rachel.
Ross,  Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a  like a friend.
Ross,  Hey! I offered to marry her!
Ross,  But I didn’t want to.
Ross, I’m sorry. Dr. Green  Mona. Mona  Dr. Green.
Chandler, I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Joey, Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper  but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.
Chandler, Could be. I mean technically she did strip  we just  we just missed it.  Ma’am  are you also a stripper?
Joey, Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker  that’s pretty funny.
Chandler, That is funny  maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.
Joey, I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
Chandler, Oh actually  I’d rather you…Yeah  go ahead. We’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
Ross, I was going to tell you  but…
Ross, Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just…  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
Joey,  Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.
Ross, No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to  I need to lie down.
Monica, Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.
Monica, My husband.
Monica, She’s a stripper.
Monica, Is that  is that what they call strippers sometimes?
Monica, Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?
Joey, Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Chandler, Why would she do that?
Joey, Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know  sexually?
Chandler, This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Joey, In a minute!
Chandler,  In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
Joey, All right  all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Chandler, Why me?!
Joey, Hey! It’s your bachelor party.
Chandler, Which is why you should do it.
Joey, I don’t want to. You do it!
Chandler, You do it!
Joey, You do it!
Chandler, All right Rock  Paper  Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?
Joey, I miss this.
Chandler, I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
Joey, No  I-I miss hanging out with you.
Chandler, Well we…we still hang out.
Joey, Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.
Chandler, Well y’know  things are different. I’m…I’m married now.
Joey, Oh sure—And hey  don’t get me wrong  I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us  y’know?
Chandler, Yeah  I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.
Joey, You got it. Come here. 
Monica,  She’s a hooker! She’s a hooker! She’s a…  Hi! Uh  we spoke on the phone. 
Ross, So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!
Rachel,  Oh no…
Phoebe, I’d better go.  Just over here: I don’t want to miss the fight.
Rachel, Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person  or via e-mail.
Ross, I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!
Rachel, Oh okay  I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?
Ross, Rachel!
Rachel, All right  I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.
Ross, Okay!
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Thank you!
Phoebe," That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren’t!"" What happened to you two?!"
Ross, Thank you so much for coming back over.
Rachel, I know Mona  just hear me out. First of all  I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you  but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Ross, Focus.
Rachel, Okay. Um…But—Okay  yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Rachel, Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, I mean he was possessive  he was jealous  he could never just let the little things go!
Ross, Trying to date this woman.
Rachel, Right! But  none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is. 
Ross, Probably shouldn’t touch me.
Rachel, I know  I get it  but Mona  what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?  I am so gonna leave right now. 
Ross, Should I leave this open for you too?
Ross, Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
Ross, I know and I was going to  but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake  but it’s only because I really  really like you. Really!
Rachel,  Forgot my purse!  Oh  you guys made up.  He’s a good kisser isn’t he?  I’m going! 
Monica, I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?
Chandler, Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt  do you really want to talk about smoking?
Monica, Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper   and you’re gonna get a stripper. 
Chandler, Monica! Wait!
Monica, What?
Chandler,  Carry on.
Monica, Ooh  these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off. 
Chandler, Could you not narrate?
Monica, Gotcha sailor. 
Phoebe,  Wow  you told your dad the truth.
Rachel, About an hour ago.
Phoebe, Wanna go see a movie?
Rachel, Yes!  Bye daddy. 
Joey,  Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to…  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.
Joey, Hey Rach listen  did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
Rachel,  Oh my…God! Let me see that! 
Joey,  You fall for it every time!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, I brought you my old maternity clothes! 
Rachel, Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet——Ooh  those are so cute!
Phoebe, Yeah! And look   see how they expand as the baby grows?  And then after the baby’s born  they’re great for shoplifting melons.
Monica,  Oh good you’re all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow  four o’clock.  Oh  guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
Rachel, No.
Monica, He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well  really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
Rachel, Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey  are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
Monica, No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time…   Anyway  umm Will’s  Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.
Rachel, Oh that’s nice.
Monica, Oh  and by the way  he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay  I mean really  really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.
Joey, I just want you to say it once in a while.
Monica, All right okay  just so you know  I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.
Joey, What?!
Monica, Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…
Joey, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Turkey’s are beautiful  intelligent animals!
Joey, No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!
Monica, All right! Okay  it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet  Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food  and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.
Joey, She is?
Rachel, Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Joey, Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Monica, Anyway  it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.
Joey, But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean  Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Monica, All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
Joey, No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!
Monica, All right  you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Joey, That’s right! ‘Cause I’m a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders  we don’t read a lot or run very fast  but damnit! We can eat!
Monica, Hey  isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table?   Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica, You too!
Phoebe, Anything I can do to help?
Monica, Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this  but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins? 
Phoebe, Sure!
Monica, I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica, No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time  remember?
Phoebe, Yeah  it all just came screaming back to me.   So how’s the game?
Chandler, I have no idea.
Phoebe, What?
Chandler, Yeah! I’m just pretending to watch the game so I don’t have to help out with stuff.
Phoebe, I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
Chandler, Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Monica, Is your team winning hon?
Chandler, Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s no Anderson.
Phoebe, Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all  I didn’t realize this game was on.
Monica, Oh  I didn’t know you liked football.
Phoebe, Well normally I don’t  but y’know……Green Bay is playing.
Monica, You like Green Bay?
Phoebe, Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually  it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter  but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Monica, Hey!
Monica, Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…
Monica, A pie! 
Monica, You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler  this is Will.
Chandler, Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus  I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.
Monica, This is Phoebe.
Phoebe,  Hey.  Wow!  Well done.
Monica,  Wanna give me a hand?
Monica, Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!
Chandler, I’m watching the game  but I’m not deaf!
Monica, Oh umm  I meant to tell you  Ross is coming.
Monica, Good. And Rachel Green too. 
Monica, Is there a problem?
Monica, What?
Chandler,  Y’know  it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.
Phoebe, Oh okay.
Chandler, Oh come on!
Phoebe, Noooo!! Damn you ref! You burn in hell!!!
Monica, Hey  what are you doing? You gotta save room  you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.
Joey, Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.
Monica, All right.
Joey, Don’t worry  Tribbianis never get full.
Joey,  Who the hell is this guy?
Monica, Will! From high school.
Joey, Oh hey!
Monica,  Joey.
Ross,  Will!
Ross, Hey-hey you came! Man you look incredible! Hot stuff!  Hot stuff?
Ross, Yeah  you too. Man  so-so what are you up to?
Ross, Really? Yeah that-that sounds interesting.
Ross, Oh! Man I don’t think I’ve seen you since uh  Lance Davis’ graduation party.
Ross, Yeah. It would’ve been good if we had gotten in  but still real fun.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross,  Yeah.
Ross, So how long are you in town?
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Hey sweetie. Oh good. 
Ross, Aw—oh  that’s right. Are-are you gonna be okay?
Ross, Will  high school was-was a long time ago.
Rachel,  Oh my God Monica  who is that?
Monica, That’s Will from high school!
Rachel, Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy  smoldering thing going on.  Oh my God  he’s… Look at the way he’s just staring at me. I think he’s trying to mouth something to me  but I can’t make it out. 
Monica, Okay  dinner’s ready!
Chandler, Good game!
Phoebe, Yeah.
Chandler, Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
Monica, Oh  so who won?
Phoebe,  Green Bay.
Chandler,  Detroit.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Well the Lions technically won  but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.
Rachel, Hi! Will  right?
Rachel, Hi! I’m Rachel Green.
Rachel, Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though  I am  I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm  did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?
Rachel, Thank you!
Monica,  Uh Rachel? Rachel  why don’t you sit here?  And Will you sit way over there. 
Joey, That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
Monica,  This is Chandler’s chicken. This is the turkey. 
Joey,  Oh. How-how big is that?
Monica, About nineteen pounds.
Joey,  It’s like me when I was born.
Rachel, All right  who would uh  like some yams? Will?
Rachel, What?  Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
Rachel, I’m sorry. What?
Joey,  Seriously  who is this guy?
Rachel, Umm  I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
Phoebe, I think you do.
Monica,  Apparently you were umm  a little mean to him in high school.
Rachel, I’m-I’m—I had no idea. I’m sorry. I…
Monica, Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…
Monica, Okay. 
Rachel, Uh Will umm  I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
Rachel, You had a club?!
Rachel, Whoa! My God! So what  you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
Ross, No need to point  she knows who Ross is.
Rachel,  So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?
Ross, No. No.
Rachel, So who else was in this club?
Ross, Uh actually  there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
Rachel, So Ross  we went out for two years  and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.
Ross, That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
Rachel, Okay Monica  did you know about this?!
Monica, I swear I didn’t.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Monica, Hmm  a little relieved  I gotta say.
Ross, Look Rach I-I’m sorry  okay? I…I was a stupid kid  okay? The only reason I joined…
Ross, …co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Rachel, Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?
Ross, No-no! No-no. No-no.
Phoebe, What?! What else did you do?
Rachel, What rumor?
Phoebe, Oh  come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Rachel, Ross!
Ross, It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
Rachel, What?!
Rachel,  Oh my God!
Monica, You started that?!
Rachel, What?! You heard that?! 
Monica, Everyone at our school heard it!
Chandler, Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Rachel, Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!  
Ross, Actually  Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
Rachel, Monica  how come you never told me this?!
Monica, I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Rachel, Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!
Joey, I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
Rachel, Oh! 
Joey, You are my Everest.
Monica, Joey  you don’t have to finish that.
Joey, Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey  but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar  wraps up the rest  and puts in the fridge? No! No  I just…I just—I gotta change my pants.  Jeans have no give. 
Rachel,"  Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year  ""Dear Rach  you’re such a good person."" Not girl! Person!"
Ross, Rach  I think you’re reading a little too much into it.
Rachel,"  ""Dear Rach  you’re a great person. Sorry about your tiney-wienie."" "
Ross, Look  what do you want me to do? Do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn’t true?!
Rachel, Yes!
Monica, Oh! Me too!
Ross, Well look-look I’m not calling anybody! Okay? It was like a million years ago!
Rachel, I don’t care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y’know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
Monica, That’s not totally true.
Rachel, What?
Ross, What?
Monica, Well you-you did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs. Altman  our 50-year-old librarian.
Ross,   How did you know that?!!!!
Monica, It’s true?!!
Ross, No.
Rachel, Yes it is! I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog!
Chandler, I’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Ross, Hey! She didn’t look 50!
Chandler, Did she look 16?
Rachel, Ohh  there’s a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
Phoebe, Oh!  Wow!
Ross, She didn’t photograph well!
Chandler, Well  she probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Phoebe, So how did this happen? Did she  did she lure you to an early bird dinner?
Ross, I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know  Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace…
Monica, Didn’t she walk with a cane?
Ross, Only when it was damp!!  I can’t believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y’know what?  I’m back in the club!
Phoebe, I wanna join!
Rachel, Wh—Phoebe!!
Phoebe, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to be in a club. I-I didn’t go to high school  but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French. Bonjour.
Rachel, All right  y’know—Fine! You guys have your stupid little club  but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie! 
Monica, All right  listen you’re just being silly. Rachel  even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!
Rachel, Wow…
Monica, And Ross  if it weren’t for Rachel’s rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!
Ross, As a romancer of the elderly.
Monica, Hey! Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.
Ross, The eyes…did still sparkle.
Monica, Hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past. You-you’ve been through so much since then. And right now you’ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life. Can’t you just let this go?
Rachel, She’s right.
Ross, Yeah. I mean we are having a baby together.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Nope.
Phoebe, Okay.  It’s exactly how I’d imagined it would be.
Joey,  All right where’s that turkey!
Phoebe, Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Joey, Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
Joey, Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats. 
Monica, Well Joey  we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
Chandler, Yes  I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Phoebe, Is there anything we can do for you?
Joey, No just  nobody press on my stomach.
Rachel, You can keep those pants by the way.
Joey, Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Monica, Yeah  you want some?
Joey, Ah  just cut me a little sliver.  A little bigger.  Little bigger.  What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!
Monica, Hey! So what do you think?
Chandler, New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress?  Boots?  Boots!
Monica, Yes! Now  they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent 
Chandler, Oh my God!
Monica, I know.
Chandler, I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
Monica," I’m sorry  they just  they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like  ""Oh  these are way too expensive for you."""
Chandler, She had a point. 
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Hey.
Rachel, Oh my God!  Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Monica, They’re mine!
Chandler, Yeah well  too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
Rachel, Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
Monica, Honey  I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot  but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides  I love the compliments. I mean  have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Chandler, I have you.
Monica, Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.
Ross, That’s right  I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
Phoebe, How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Rachel,  He’s talking to the baby.
Phoebe," Ohh! Okay! Okay  cause when-when he said  ""I can’t wait to hear your first words "" I thought  ""There’s a trick."""
Rachel, Okay. Well  I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.
Phoebe, Okay.
Ross, Bye.
Rachel, Bye. 
Joey, Oh hey Rach  listen—Hi!
Rachel, Hi.
Joey, Umm  can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…
Rachel, No  forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Joey, No-no-no-no-no-no  not her  not her. My youngest sister  Dina  she’s really interested in fashion  and she wants to talk to someone successful  y’know  to give her some advice.
Rachel, I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
Joey, Oh no-no-no-no  she wants to talk to you!
Rachel, Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!
Joey, Okay  so will you meet with her?
Rachel, Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.
Joey, Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh  she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey  y’know the S.A.T’s?
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, She took ‘em!
Phoebe, Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Ross, Yeah. Why?
Phoebe, Sting has a son that goes there too!
Ross, Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
Phoebe, You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Ross, Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? 
Phoebe, Sting’s son  seven years old and there’s a picture.
Ross, What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Phoebe, No  it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Ross, Uh  I actually haven’t even met him.
Phoebe, Uh-huh  yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night  but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
Ross, Well actually  I’m picking Ben up tomorrow  maybe he’ll be there.
Phoebe, There you go! Oh  you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
Monica, Hey guys!
Chandler, Hey-hey.
Rachel, Hi Monica!
Monica, Hey. 
Rachel, Hi boots.
Monica, See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See  you can wear them with dresses  with skirts  with pants…
Chandler, You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. 
Phoebe, Wow! They’re beautiful!
Rachel, Ahh…
Monica,  They hurt so much!
Phoebe, What?!
Monica, The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Rachel, Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!
Monica, I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time  I just can’t give them away!
Phoebe, Well then get your money back and return them!
Monica, I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Ross,  Hey!
Chandler,  Hey!
Ross, Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
Chandler,  I don’t think you did a very thorough job!
Ross, I dropped him off at Carol’s.  Anyway  it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Phoebe, Oh no! Why not?
Ross, Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
Phoebe, How come?!
Ross, Apparently  Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
Phoebe, Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Ross, Phoebe  you can’t force kids to be friends.
Phoebe, Sure you can! Give them some blocks  put them in a playpen!
Ross, Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
Phoebe, Your kid is seven?!   He’s really small.  Please! Please get the tickets!
Ross, Look I’m sorry Pheebs  I can’t do it.
Phoebe, Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Ross, What?
Phoebe,  Rosssss can!
Ross, Look Phoebe  I’m sorry it’s just…
Phoebe,  Rossss can!
Ross, Phoebe  I…
Phoebe,  Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Joey,  Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Rachel, Oh Joey  I’m hardly a…
Joey, My little sister Dina!
Rachel, Right! Hi Dina!
Rachel, Nice to meet you. 
Joey, This is so exciting for her. Well  I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. 
Rachel, Okay. All right Dina  well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see  there’s design  but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh  there’s-there’s sales  which is great because you get to travel…
Rachel,  And there’s marketing…
Monica,  Ahhhhhhhh!
Chandler,  What’s wrong?
Monica, Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. 
Chandler, Oh don’t forget  my office holiday party is tonight. 
Monica, Honey  we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Chandler, Now sweetie  I know you don’t like my office parties  but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
Monica, I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.
Chandler, Why not?
Monica, Well y’know  I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Chandler, Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Monica, Anyway  I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the  and the boots don’t really go with it.
Chandler, You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts  dresses  and pants!
Monica, Fine! If you want me to wear the boots  I’ll wear the boots. In fact  I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Okay?  Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! 
Rachel, Honey  it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me  and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. 
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, Hey! It’s my fashion girls!  What’s wrong?
Rachel, Honey  why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Joey,  Oh. What’s  what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?
Joey, Is that a sandwich?!
Rachel, Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
Joey,  What?!
Rachel,  Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! 
Joey, Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Rachel, What?! Dina…
Joey,  Bub!!!   I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Joey, You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right  I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Joey, I can’t look at you right now! 
Rachel, I know.
Phoebe, Oh  there you are Ben!
Phoebe, Well  I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down  have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm  the boy’s name is Sting’s son.
Phoebe, Now Ben  sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside  but they have famous fathers.
Phoebe, Him you’re friends with. 
Phoebe, Yes! Yes you can  I’m looking for Jack’s parents.
Phoebe, Uh-huh  I’m with Ben.
Phoebe, I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was  it was difficult coming out to my parents.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
Phoebe, Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk  just me  my lover Carol  and the Stings. Umm  how-how will I get in touch with them?
Phoebe, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm  could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out  she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain  but man what a hot piece of ass.
Chandler, Y’know  that party wasn’t bad.
Monica, Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Chandler, I don’t see any uh  cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Monica, Oh no  we can’t walk!
Chandler, What honey  it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.
Monica, Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Chandler, What’s going on?
Monica, I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Chandler, What?
Monica, Okay you were right! All right  I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!
Chandler, So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.
Monica, How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Chandler, Hop on.
Monica, Okay. Wait  just give me a second  I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…
Chandler, Honey  I know you’re in pain right now  but I’m a little turned on.
Rachel, What college was that Dina?
Rachel, Joey  what are you doing?
Joey, Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved  we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…
Rachel, Oh Joey this is crazy!
Joey, Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right  okay. Do you Dina  take this man…
Joey, Oh you’ll take ‘em!
Joey, Hey! You don’t get a say in this!
Joey," Ahhh! I heard ""I do""  we’re halfway there! Okay!  You!"
Rachel, All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen  as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is  it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license  they don’t have any witnesses  and the groom only has on one shoe!
Joey, Well what am I supposed to do?
Rachel, You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Joey, No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel, Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?
Rachel, Oh  come on kids! A little help here!
Phoebe, Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway! 
Phoebe, Hi!
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, Why else would I be here?
Phoebe, Uh-huh. 
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe, Umm  I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?
Phoebe, Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then  could we reschedule? For say  Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?
Phoebe, Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert  and he’s obviously busy during.
Phoebe, Unless! Unless umm  okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert  umm  all the while thinking about the children of course.
Phoebe, Oh  thank you. Four would be great.
Phoebe, Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!
Phoebe, The Police? Here? A reunion?! 
Chandler, Okay  ten blocks down. Five to go.
Monica,  Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Chandler, Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
Monica, My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Chandler, I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
Monica, Okay  I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Chandler,  I don’t have your boots.
Monica, Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?
Chandler, Well  why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Monica, Okay.  God well  we gotta go back and get them!
Chandler, Honey  are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Monica, Okay  I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.
Chandler, Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Monica, Okay.  All right.
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica,  Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! 
Rachel, Joey  just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Joey, Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now  what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Joey,  You were right. He is funny.
Rachel, Hey  now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby  why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?
Rachel,  Really? 
Joey, Dina  if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude  that’s not a compliment!
Joey, So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!
Rachel, Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Joey, No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
Joey, One pregnant woman at a time  please! I just want you to be okay.
Rachel, So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Joey, Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh  what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!
Joey, Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
Joey, Well I’d be scared of them  but all right.
Joey, Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Joey, That’s right! By his uncle too!
Rachel, Okay Bobby  why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 
Joey, Come here! 
Rachel, No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
Ross, You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! 
Phoebe, Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Ross, Well…let’s just say…  Rosss caaaaan!
Phoebe, Oo  where are the seats?
Ross, Uh  middle balcony.
Phoebe, Okay  now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting  his wife  or a member of his family?
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe, Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
Rachel, Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Rachel, Look at that guy by the window  wow!
Phoebe, He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest  he’s not that good in bed.
Rachel, Oh  what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example  I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to  but right now  with the way I’m feeling  all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Phoebe, Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy  right?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, This is completely normal  around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Rachel, Really?! So this has happened to you?
Phoebe, Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind  now  I was carrying triplets so in  y’know  medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Rachel, Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend  I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.
Phoebe, Yeah. Yeah  I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Rachel, Ah.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, Well  y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow  I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Phoebe, Yeah. Yeah  that’s what you need a good…pill.
Ross, Hi!
Ross, Oh great! Hey-hey Joey  do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Joey, Oh uh  ordinarily I would love too  but I am just swamped right now. 
Ross, Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Joey, I’m missin’ picture time?! 
Phoebe,  Y’know she has a face Ross!
Ross, Wow! That is a good one! Wow  it looks like a  like a holiday card y’know  with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Ross,  Together? Like-like to people?
Ross, Okay. 
Ross, Uh sure  sure.
Phoebe, Bye.
Joey,  Congratulations! You just got married!
Ross, I know. Can you believe that?
Phoebe, Wait  I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?
Ross, Married couples send out cards  families send out cards  people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Joey, Hey-hey-hey  hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!
Chandler, Honey  you remember my boss Doug right?
Monica, Yes  hi.
Chandler, I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced  I’m sorry.
Monica, No leg-chewing for us sir.
Monica, I can’t think of anything we’re doing.  Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?
Monica, Okay  I’ll see you tomorrow!  Just so you know  we’re not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Chandler, No.
Monica, That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Chandler, Oh yeah. Boy  urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?
Ross, Hey!
Ross, Huh. Wow  this is great.
Ross, Well  we-we haven’t said that to each other yet  but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
Ross, A hundred?! Well  I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona  uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh  card thing.
Ross, Sending out a holiday card  together  I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, Huh.
Ross, Hmm…
Ross, Let’s do the card!
Ross, The card! I think we’re there!
Ross, Really?! I mean  even with the card?
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Oh  okay. Hey  can I ask you a question? Was it me  or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about  bald haircut  hairy fingers… 
Rachel, Yes  you are.
Rachel, Oh  really  really good. But enough about me  come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
Rachel, Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time  do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Rachel, Oh  I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Rachel, No. I’m very comfortable.
Rachel, No! Shoot  Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Rachel, Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Rachel, Do you feel it too?
Rachel, Hi.
Phoebe, Oh hey! So  how did your doctor’s appointment go?
Rachel, Well  let’s see. Uh  they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
Phoebe, Oh my God.
Monica, Why did you do that?
Phoebe, Okay  remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Monica, Oh yeah  the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
Phoebe, You wish.
Monica, Hey  I could’ve had you if I wanted you.
Phoebe, Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Rachel, Okay  even this is turning me on!
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it  how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
Ross, Oh yeah  yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
Monica, You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Ross, Yeah  we’re not just doing a card! Y’know  she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Phoebe, Ugh! Women!
Ross," I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman  ""So  where is this going?"""
Rachel, Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Ross, Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides  I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know  something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
Monica, Like asking her to move in with you?
Ross, Smaller than that.
Monica, Making her a mixed tape?
Ross, Uh  bigger than that.
Phoebe, Give her a key to your apartment.
Ross, Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Monica," All right. Have you said  ""I love you?"" You could say  I love you."
Ross, Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet  but I could say I looove spending time with you.
Phoebe, No  we hate that.
Monica, That is a slap in the face.
Ross, Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are  and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Rachel, I think  if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Chandler, Oh uh  as it turns out  we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
Chandler, Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
Chandler, It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
Chandler, Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
Chandler, Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Chandler, Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
Ross, Here we go. Mona umm  I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
Ross, Aw  we-we are so… So umm  well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm  y’know hanging out with you. And I mean-I’m having a lot of fun. 
Ross, I mean  there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be  it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking  fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know  but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you  not you  you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?
Ross, Well  well to sum up  we’re having fun  you look young.
Ross, But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment. 
Ross, Really.
Rachel, You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Ross, Not just a key  I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Phoebe,  Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?
Ross, Oh great  I live on the street.
Phoebe, Where?! 
Rachel, Hey!
Phoebe, Hi! Okay  Monica  Rachel  this is my friend Roger.
Monica, Hi Roger.
Phoebe, So umm  I’m gonna get us some drinks.  Would you help me out?
Rachel, Yeah. 
Phoebe, Umm  he’s here to have sex with you.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, You’re welcome.
Rachel, Phoebe no!
Phoebe, It’s okay  he’s a virgin.
Monica, Rachel umm  I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.
Phoebe, Yeah  okay let’s leave these two alone.
Rachel, No! I do not care what my hormones are doing  I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Phoebe, Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this! 
Chandler, Oh that’s all right sir  and that’s just one girl.
Chandler, It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
Chandler, Oh no-no-no!
Ross, Okay  and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
Ross, No. That guy is.
Ross, I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
Ross, I love you!
Chandler, Hi honey I’m home.
Monica, From the tequila factory?
Chandler, It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars  and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring  he threw a soda can at a bird!
Monica, Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Chandler, Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me  that we will grow old together  and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
Monica, I promise. Hey  speaking of together  how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Chandler, Ooh  I don’t know if we’re there yet.
Rachel, Yes. Hi  I’d like to order a pizza. Okay  can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.  I’ll call you back.
Joey, Who was that?
Rachel, It’s just the pizza place.
Joey, You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.
Rachel, I’m sorry honey  I’m just having a  having a rough day.
Joey, Oh  what’s wrong?
Rachel, Oh you really  you really just don’t want to hear about it.
Joey, Then why did I ask?
Rachel, Okay  it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm  erotically charged.
Joey, Is that college talk for horny?
Rachel, Yeah. So y’know  I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them  because I can’t date like a normal person  which is fine because I don’t need a relationship  I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex  y’know? No strings attached  no relationship  just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night  I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?
Joey, Good  I uh  I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Rachel, Well  I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.
Joey, Yeah  I gotta  I gotta go to my room too.
Rachel, Okay  good night!
Joey, Good night. 
Joey,  I can’t do it!
Rachel,  I didn’t ask you to do it!
Joey, You’re Rachel!
Rachel, You’re Joey!
Joey, You’re my friend!
Rachel, Right back at ya!
Joey, But plus  it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Rachel, And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!
Joey, I know!
Joey, Do you wanna do it?
Rachel, No!
Joey, All right  me neither! I was just testing you!
Rachel, That’s the end of this conversation!
Joey, This conversation never happened!
Rachel, Never happened! Good night!
Joey, Good night!
Joey, Get back in there! 
Phoebe, Hi. Listen  I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right  and I  and I want to make it up to you  so umm  I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy.  Now  this is just a loan. Okay? I’m gonna  I’m gonna want him back. So…  I’m gonna go now.    I’m sorry  I thought I could do it and I can’t! 
Phoebe, Hey! I got you a present!!
Chandler, Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Phoebe, I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago  and it finally got here!
Chandler, Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
Monica,  I love it! It’s huge!! Let’s open it! Open it!! 
Phoebe, It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
Monica, Oh my God!
Phoebe, I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
Monica, Oh well  maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Chandler, Oh  okay.
Monica, All right. 
Chandler, I kinda like it here.
Phoebe, Do you really like it?
Monica, Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my  this is like my second favorite game!
Phoebe, Oh really? What was your first?
Monica, Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.
Chandler, Well what did it do?
Monica, Well  you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Chandler, A vending machine?
Monica, Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Ross, Hey! Oh  I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
Joey,  Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Ross, Professor Neuman  the head of the department  so….
Rachel, They made you head of the department!
Ross, No  I get to teach one of his advanced classes!  Why didn’t I get head of the department? 
Joey, Oh! Hey Rach  listen umm…
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, I got a big date coming up  do you know a good restaurant?
Rachel, Uh  Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.
Joey, Ooh  great! Thanks!
Rachel, Yeah! Oh  and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!
Joey, You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex  I’ll tell ya…
Rachel, Ooh  I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long  and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Joey, Hey  y’know what?
Rachel, Huh?
Joey, Why don’t I take you out?
Rachel, What?! Joey  you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Joey, Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out  we’re gonna have a good time  and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…
Rachel,  Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.
Joey, I’ll be fun.
Rachel, All right?
Phoebe, No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh  would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores  how sad.
Monica, Okay  I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!
Phoebe, Oh  I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.
Monica, Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
Chandler, Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
Monica, You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.
Chandler, I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
Phoebe, Wait okay  if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you  then maybe I should just keep it.
Monica, No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact  why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Chandler, Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Phoebe, Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Monica, Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on  get out—out of the chair. Get out!  Oh come…Phoebe!
Rachel, Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Joey, No  I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you. 
Rachel, Ohh  Lilies. Joey  they’re my favorite. Thank you.
Joey, And  a brownie!  Well  half a brownie. Actually  it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…
Rachel, Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although  I have a hint of morning sickness  and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.
Joey, Hey come on now  this is a real date. Uh  so…nice place you got here. Foosball  huh? Pizza box. Oh  a subscription to Playboy  my kind of woman.
Rachel, Yeah  actually that’s my roommate’s.
Joey, I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Rachel, Ah yes  but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.
Joey, Ah… Hey  so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
Rachel, Hm-mmm.
Joey, Oh yeah  it must be tough to keep your hands of him  huh?
Rachel,  Yeah  but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.
Joey, No-no-no-no  he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Ross, …which brings us back  of course  to Greely’s theory of dominance.  Okay  that-that’s all for today. Oh  uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
Ross, What?! That-that’s all the way cross town  I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Ross, Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I’m the teacher!!
Ross, Hello.  I’m sorry I’m a little late. Ah——Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh  by introducing myself  I am Professor Geller.  So to sum up  I’m Professor Geller. Good job today.
Rachel, Now the filet mignon  what comes with that?
Rachel, Emmm. Now  instead of the vegetables  is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
Joey, Y’know what? Bring her both  and I’ll have the same. 
Rachel, Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh  I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.
Joey, Oh whoa-whoa-whoa  no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.
Rachel, Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
Joey, No! No. Umm  just myself and if they don’t like me for— I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.
Rachel, I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Joey, Oh alright. Umm  well  okay  I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Rachel, Oh my God. And that works?!
Joey," Well it does when you combine it with  ""This is so embarrassing  I just want to have a normal life!"""
Rachel, Oh  you poor little famous man.
Joey, Oh okay  how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you  but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.
Rachel,  Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic  I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
Joey, Alright  so…so tell me one of your moves.
Rachel, Alright. So where’d you grow up?
Joey, That’s your move? Boy Rach  you’re lucky you’re hot.
Rachel, Come on  just answer the question!
Joey,  Queens.
Rachel, And so were-were you close to your parents?
Joey, Yeah  with my mom. Yeah  not so much with my dad.
Rachel, Why not?
Joey, I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there  but it is.
Rachel,  Oh.  It’s gotta be rough.
Joey, Yeah  it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!
Rachel, Huh?
Joey," ""Where’d you grow up "" it’s so simple!"
Rachel, Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me  I have to go to the rest room.
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel, And now you’re watching me walk away.
Joey, Yes I am! Again so simple!
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, You are not going to believe what I did today!
Monica, Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.
Chandler, I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.
Monica, Wait a minute  you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Chandler, Uh-huh  and I got all the top ten scores  I erased Phoebe off the board! High five! 
Monica, What is the matter with your hand?
Chandler, Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours  it’ll loosen up. Come on  check out the scores. Oh  and also look at the initials  they’re dirty words.
Monica, Chandler  why would you do that?
Chandler, Because it’s awesome.
Monica, You think this is clever?
Chandler, Well y’know  they only give you three letters  so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
Monica, Hey wait a minute  this one isn’t dirty.
Chandler, It is when you put it together with that one.
Monica, Ah  well if you don’t clear this off  you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game  this can’t be there.
Chandler, Come on  he won’t even know what they mean.
Monica, Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.
Chandler, Have you talked to him lately?
Monica, All right  look I’m just gonna unplug it.
Chandler, No-no-no  if you unplug it  I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at that! Look at that  it’s still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM  Chip in it or something!
Monica, Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Chandler, With the claw?!
Monica, All right fine. Fine  I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
Chandler,  Pull my finger——My hand is messed up.
Rachel, I am not gonna answer that!
Joey, Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica  Phoebe  Chandler  and Ross if you had to  if you had to  who would you punch?
Rachel, No one! They are my friends  I wouldn’t punch any of them.
Joey, Chandler?
Rachel, Yeah  but I don’t know why. Look at me  I’m having such a wonderful time!
Joey, Me too! Hey Rach  can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Rachel, I know!
Joey, I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Rachel, Joey  I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Joey, I gotta say  I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Rachel, Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Joey, Huh. Huh.
Rachel, All right  now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves  but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.
Joey, Ah! Okay  well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before. 
Rachel, So tell me  what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?
Joey, Ah  well  if I want the girl to kiss me  first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Rachel, How do you do that?
Joey, Now you can’t tell anyone  but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Joey, Yeah  like a moth to a flame  I’m telling ya. Okay all right  so now you go.
Rachel, No  I don’t want to tell you.
Joey, Why not?
Rachel, Because it’s embarrassing.
Joey, More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach  just tell me!
Rachel,"  Okay. All right  stand up.  Well  when we’re at the door  I lightly press my lips against his  and then move into his body just for a second  and then I make this sound  ""Hmmm."" Okay  I know it doesn’t sound like anything  but I swear it works."
Joey,  Yeah. Why—Yeah  that would work for ya…
Rachel, All right  I gotta go to bed. Honey  I had such a wonderful time.
Joey, Oh.  Yeah.  Me to. 
Rachel, …you were 50 minutes late to the class  what did you crawl there?!
Ross," No  I ran. It was really far  and when did people stop understanding the phrase  ""Get the hell out of my way!"""
Rachel, Well  why didn’t you just take a cab?
Ross, Ugh  between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides  I teach the class three times a week  who am I? Rockefeller?
Rachel, Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.
Ross, Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t  they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
Rachel, You what?
Ross, You’ve seen it  the Geller Yeller.
Rachel, Right. Wow!
Ross, Besides  I-I think I figured out a much faster route  I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars. 
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi! Hey  remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
Joey, Oh yeah  I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Rachel, Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!
Joey, Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Rachel, Yeah I know it’s really boring  but it’s like a big deal. Anyway  I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Joey, Oh yeah? All right  let’s do it tonight.
Rachel, Well don’t you have that big date tonight?
Joey, Oh right!
Rachel, Hey Joey  can I ask you something?
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel, After our date last night  did you feel a little weird?
Joey, Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out  what was that?!
Rachel, I don’t know!  I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…
Joey, Oh yeah-yeah  the lobster.
Rachel, Yeah  I mean I was up sick all night.
Joey, Yeah me too  all night.
Rachel, Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?
Joey, Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah  you don’t want to look in my hamper.
Monica, Okay  I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right  come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right— Well  you’re just a little bitch  aren’t you?
Phoebe,  Hey  you guys. Listen  I’m sorry that I was hogging the game before——Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
Monica, They’re all Chandler.
Phoebe, Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
Chandler, I did.  But it came at a price.
Monica, But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.
Chandler, Oh come on  by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
Ross, Yeah!!!! Yes  I made it! I’m on time!  Okay  why don’t we all uh   open our books to page 23. Where…  Where you will see…a uh…a bunch of uh…red spots. Okay   umm  why don’t  why don’t you all start to read  while I—
Joey, No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey  can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?
Joey, Yeah. Yeah  that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.
Joey,  Ooh! Yeah. So yeah  so you know exactly what I’m talking about.
Joey, Oh yeah  sure.  Ehhh.
Monica, Oh my God Phoebe  you’re on fire!
Phoebe, I know!
Chandler, One more score to go! You can do it! 
Phoebe, Don’t touch me!!
Monica, Don’t touch her!!
Chandler, All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Phoebe, I can’t!! I can’t!!  Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Ross, Phoebe!!
Phoebe, Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine! 
Rachel, Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.
Joey,  Alone?!
Rachel, Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Joey, Hey  did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?
Rachel, No! No! Seriously  what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute  what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
Joey, Oh uh  it didn’t work out.
Rachel, Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Joey, Oh uh  okay. Yeah.
Rachel, Y’know  I never thought I’d say this about a movie  but I really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here  you protect me.
Joey, Oh sure  yeah  why not? 
Rachel, Okay.  Okay  that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!
Joey, All right  I know! I know. Yeah  it’ll be okay.
Rachel, Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch!  Oh. Seriously  how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?
Joey, Terrified. 
Ross, So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now  the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.  Here.  Here.  Now as for the hydrosaurs…
Joey,  All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel  you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are  as your friend Tony would say  Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Rachel,  Hi  sweetie.
Joey,  Hey  it’s your girlfriend  Rachel!
Monica,  Hi.
Chandler, Are you  are you high?
Monica, I just had the most amazing bath.
Chandler, Really? I don’t like baths.
Monica, Wait  you like them with me.
Chandler, Honey  it’s not the bath I enjoy  it’s the wet  naked lady.
Monica, Oh  baths are so relaxing!
Chandler, Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Monica, How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you  if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music  you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.
Chandler, Honey  it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules  how stressed do you think I am?
Joey,  Hey  Chandler  you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Chandler, Oh! Uh  yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Joey, Well  neither.
Chandler, Oh my God  what’s up?!
Joey, I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately  I’ve been feeling… Okay  here’s what it is…  You know what? I feel a lot better  thanks! 
Chandler, Oh no-no  no you don’t  just come back.
Joey, All right. Okay. You and Monica  friends for a long time  and sure there are rules  but then you went to London. Oh  no  but that’s different. I mean  there are rules there  too! You know what I mean?
Chandler, Do you?
Joey, It was different for you guys! I mean  I mean  you were both in the same place  right?
Chandler, In London?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Yes. When Monica and I were in London  we were both in London.
Joey, You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it  and listen  do me a favor  this conversation was between you and me.
Chandler, If that.
Rachel, Hi! Oh  Ross  don’t forget  we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!
Ross, Right.
Phoebe, Hey  are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Ross, No-no  we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.
Rachel, Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Ross, And smart!
Rachel, Popular.
Ross, With an aptitude for science.
Phoebe, Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Rachel, Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!
Ross, Really? Me too!
Phoebe, Me too!
Rachel, Really?!
Phoebe, Uh huh! If it’s a girl  Phoebe  and if it’s a boy  Phoebo!
Ross, Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup  you know? Uh  Rach-Rach  what were you thinking? 
Rachel, Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl  how about Sandrine? It’s French.
Ross, Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Rachel, Okay fine  what do you have?
Ross, Well  OK  it’s for a boy. Well  I know it’s a little out there  but…Darwin.
Rachel, Wow  oh my God  our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Phoebe, Yeah  by Sandrine.
Ross, You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
Rachel, I’m really  really not.
Phoebe, How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Ross, All right.
Rachel, All right.
Ross, That sounds fair.
Rachel, Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay  check this out. If it’s a girl  Rain.
Ross, Veto.
Rachel, Why?
Ross, Rain? Hi. Hi  my name is Rain. I have my own kiln  and my dress is made out of wheat.
Phoebe, I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Ross, Okay  how about  for a guy  Thatcher?
Rachel, Ross  why do you hate our child?
Ross, Fine  you go.
Rachel, Okay  James.
Ross, Huh.
Rachel, But only if it’s a girl.
Ross, Oh  veto. How about—Ooh  I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Rachel, Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?
Ross, Veto. Stewart?
Rachel, Veto. Sawyer?
Ross, Veto. Helen?
Rachel, Veto.
Phoebe, Is it me  or is veto starting to sound really good?
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Boy  do I have a surprise for you!
Chandler, Sex on the balcony?
Monica, No  but someone’s really not going to get over that idea  are they?
Chandler, What is it?
Monica, I drew you a bath!
Chandler, Honey  I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Monica, Please  could you just try it for me? Come on  I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts  plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!
Chandler, Well  this does butch it up a bit.
Monica, I swear  if you try it  you will love it!
Chandler, All right  if I do this  can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Monica, Absolutely.
Monica, Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.
Chandler,  All right  this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay  because I’ve got my boat.
Monica,  So?
Chandler, Oh my God.
Monica, I told you you were a bath person! Hey  when you get out  maybe I can give you a facial!
Chandler, I’m going to need a bigger boat.
Ross, I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean  come on  little Ruthie Geller  how-how cute is that?
Rachel, Oh  oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Ross, Uh  no. No  we’re not.
Rachel, But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Ross, No  no  we want to wait  right?
Rachel, Right. Right.
Rachel,  So  which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Ross, What? Rach! Come on  that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.
Rachel, Third one from the left?
Ross, Yeah  why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, You’re looking!
Rachel, I didn’t!
Ross, I saw you!
Rachel, Okay fine  I did. But I didn’t see anything  I swear.
Ross, Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Rachel, Okay  but Ross just listen to me…
Ross, No  no  no  no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!
Rachel, But I couldn’t even if I wanted to  because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything  and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Ross, Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?
Rachel,  Okay  a couple months late on the lecture  Ross.
Monica, Hello?
Chandler, I’m in the bathroom  can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
Monica, You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.
Chandler, I’m in the bathtub.
Monica, Oh.  What’s wrong?
Chandler, I drew my own bath  but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
Monica, What?
Chandler, The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.
Monica, Okay  let’s talk about something else.
Chandler, Yeah! Sure  sure. So  what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Monica, Well  I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…
Chandler, I had the exact same conversation.
Monica, You did? What was he talking about?
Chandler, I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
Monica,  That was a long night.
Chandler, All right  let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Monica, Okay  he was talking about rules.
Chandler, Uh-huh.
Monica, Umm  and looking at people differently.
Chandler, He didn’t say anything about that to me.
Monica, What did he tell you?
Chandler, He was asking all these questions about you  me  and London. And  of course the glue that holds this all together  the rules.
Monica, Okay. So you  me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
Chandler, But what did he mean by rules?
Monica, Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Chandler, Because he was looking at her differently.
Monica, And Phoebe is his friend  so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Chandler, My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Phoebe,  You guys?
Monica, Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!
Chandler, You don’t say anything.
Monica, Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank  and we could all start having babies?
Chandler, I’m not going to let you say anything.
Monica, You just stay here! 
Chandler, Oh  God!
Phoebe, Oh  hey  Monica  I brought back your iron.
Monica, Oh  you had that?
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Monica, I thought I lost it. I got a new one  like  a month ago.
Phoebe, Oh  just as well  I broke this one.
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Nothing.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, I mean  I-I  I really shouldn’t say. I mean  I’m really not supposed to.
Phoebe, Fine.
Monica, It’s a humdinger!
Phoebe, Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
Monica, Somebody likes you!
Phoebe,  Is it Chandler?
Monica, No!
Phoebe, Well  then tell him to stop staring!
Monica, It’s Joey!
Phoebe, Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
Monica, Is it something you’d be interested in?
Phoebe, I don’t know  I don’t know  I don’t know. You know  I mean  on the one hand  Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No  I can’t. We’re friends. No  oh  no. I don’t want to risk what we have.
Monica, I guess that makes sense. So  you think you’re going to talk to him?
Phoebe, Sure  yeah. I mean  it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well  I must say  I am on fire! First Chandler  now Joey!
Monica, Not Chandler  just Joey.
Phoebe, Sure.
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Ross, Rach  I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless  you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
Rachel, I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.
Ross, I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy  and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
Rachel, I would—Sequoia?
Ross, Veto.
Rachel, Fine.
Ross, Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl  and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well  I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
Rachel, But Ross  you want the name Ruth!
Ross, Not like this!
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, Hey. Well  what’s up?
Phoebe, Umm  Joey  I know.
Joey, What?
Phoebe, I knooow.
Joey, Whaaat?
Phoebe, I know about your feelings.
Joey, Oh my God. You do?
Phoebe, Yes  and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica  but that’s very rare.
Joey, I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean  it’s Rachel for God sakes.
Phoebe, For God sakes  it’s Rachel!
Joey, I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!
Phoebe, Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.
Joey, What am I going to do? You know  and I keep  I keep trying to get rid of these feelings  y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?
Phoebe, Yeah.
Joey, She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And  you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Phoebe, Joey  I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.
Joey, You think?
Phoebe, Absolutely! Y’know  you get this rush of feelings  but then it goes away.
Joey, Yeah  just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.
Phoebe, That’s right  there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well  except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.
Joey, Not really.
Phoebe, Mm-hmm.  Throw me a bone here.
Ross, So  I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.
Rachel, What?
Ross, That’s right. The student has become the master.
Rachel, Ross  I swear  I don’t know.
Ross, Oh  come on  you know it’s a girl!
Rachel, A what?!
Ross, You really didn’t know?
Rachel, We’re having a girl?
Ross, No.
Rachel, That’s what you just said!
Ross, No.
Rachel, You said girl!
Ross, Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Rachel, I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
Ross, I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!
Rachel, Oh  yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
Ross, Permission to veto.
Rachel, Yes  please.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Do I smell essential oils?
Monica, Yeah  I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, What do you think you’re doing?
Chandler, L-leaving my troubles behind?
Monica, I know that you’re new at this  but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.
Chandler, Oh  it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
Monica, Fine  you can have the bath  but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!
Chandler,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hi  Bubbles. Manly. Well  I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Chandler,  You told her?!
Monica, She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?
Phoebe, Well  you were wrong  he doesn’t like me!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you  and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
Monica,  I don’t think I’d care.
Phoebe, Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Joey,  Hello?
Phoebe, We’re in the bathroom!
Joey, Why?
Chandler,  Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
Joey,  What are you guys doing in here?
Monica, Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently  but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!
Chandler, You like Rachel?!
Joey, It’s no big deal  okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away!  Dude  you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Phoebe,   Mazel tov.
Rachel,  Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here?  Oh  my! 
Monica, Honey  cover it up with the boat!
Ross,  Hello?
Chandler,  Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Ross,  Well hey! What’s going on? Ooh  cool boat——Oh  no.   Hey  did you  did you tell them?
Rachel, No  I was waiting for you!
Phoebe, Tell us what?
Rachel, We’re having a girl.
Chandler, I’ll…I’ll get you later!
Joey,"  All right. It’s a new day  and it’s just a crush  that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing  that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say  ""it was cuckoo!"" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush."
Rachel,  Hi  sweetie.
Joey,  I love you.
Monica, It sure is nice to do this together  isn’t it?
Chandler, Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
Monica, I’m not touching you.
Chandler, You’re not?
Monica, It’s the salts.
Chandler, Oh  sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Monica,  Whatever keeps you off the balcony  big guy!
Monica,  Hey  what’s up?
Phoebe, Well  I left my guitar here again.
Monica, Oh  okay. No problem.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, Oh.
Monica, Here you go.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, Great! Umm…
Monica, What?!
Phoebe, So do you want to hang out or something?
Monica, Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Phoebe, Oh are you and Chandler…
Monica, Yes! Exactly.
Phoebe, Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Monica,  No. 
Chandler, Hey Pheebs  what’s up?
Phoebe, You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Phoebe, Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Monica, Phoebe  I can explain!
Phoebe, You told me you hate massages!
Chandler, Buy stamps  pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
Phoebe, I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
Monica, Well umm  Alexandra has been…
Phoebe, Oh  it has a name?
Monica, Phoebe  don’t get upset!
Phoebe, Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go! 
Chandler, Well  Phoebe I thought I’d——Yeah  what the hell. 
Joey, Oh okay  okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey  we’re almost there! We’re almost there!
Rachel, Oh Joey  I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
Joey, Oh  I love you too.
Rachel, And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but  you’re the best sex I ever had.
Joey, That’s always appropriate!  Oh  okay. One more push! One more push!
Ross,  I hope you’re a better father than you’re a friend!! 
Rachel,  Joey! Joey!
Joey, What? What’s going on?
Rachel, Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Joey, Aaaah…
Rachel, Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Joey, Really?!
Rachel, Yes!
Joey, Oh  y’know what? Maybe uh  you…you should come to me. I’m a not  I’m not wearing any bottoms.
Rachel, Oh  okay! 
Joey, Oh my  oh my God!
Rachel, Aw  it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh  she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Joey, Mia Hamm?
Rachel, Mia Hamm!
Joey, Oh that’s amazing. 
Rachel,  Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Joey, Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Chandler, Hey babe.
Monica, Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they? 
Chandler, Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
Monica, No  it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?
Chandler, How about to the street say from the balcony?
Monica, Why don’t we just find a place for it?
Chandler, Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Monica, No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
Chandler, How about the closet by the bathroom? 
Monica, Oh  okay. Here  why don’t you let me do it?
Chandler, Oh no-no-no  I will do it. Honey  you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It’s locked  you have to help me. Why is it locked?
Monica, No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Chandler, Oh y’know  I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is  what is in there?
Monica, Feminine stuff.
Chandler, Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Monica, Chandler  there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.
Chandler, Fine.
Monica, Thank you! 
Chandler,  Love you.
Phoebe,  Hello Chandler  lovely day huh?  You!
Chandler," Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said  ""If it helps!"" "
Phoebe, Why won’t you let me massage you?
Monica, Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.
Phoebe, Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
Monica, That’s different  we were roommates! And when?!
Phoebe, I’m curious about the human body.
Monica, Hey  come on Phoebe  you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Phoebe, But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look  if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance  okay. Please?
Monica, Okay  if it means that much to you…
Phoebe, It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
Monica, Dinosaurs.
Phoebe, Potato  potaato.
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
Ross, What?! It is?! 
Rachel, It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
Ross, Hey  when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Rachel, Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
Joey, A dreamless sleep.
Ross, My God  the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.
Joey, Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
Ross, Look  I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number  okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.
Joey, Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Phoebe,  Are you under the sheet?
Monica, Yes.
Phoebe,  Great  let’s begin.  How’s the pressure?
Monica, Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Phoebe, Stating the obvious  but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.
Monica, No. Ooohh…
Phoebe, That’s right  you just enjoy.
Monica,  Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Phoebe,  Okay.
Monica, Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh that’s it! That’s it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… 
Chandler, I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! 
Joey, Whoa  Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Chandler, Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.
Joey, Why not?
Chandler, I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!
Joey, I don’t know. Ooh  I bet it’s Richard.
Chandler, Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Joey, Well off the top of my head uhh  maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Chandler, And here we go…
Joey, I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it  and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!
Rachel, Joey. Joey  something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! 
Joey, Oh hey whoa-whoa  don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book  it was always nothing.
Rachel, Really?
Joey, Absolutely. But  we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure  okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.
Rachel, Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
Joey, Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me  look at me  everything’s gonna be fine  trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones!
Joey, Hey! So?
Rachel, Hmm  mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?
Joey, So but everything is normal.
Joey, And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?
Rachel, Thank you doctor.   Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Joey, Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!
Rachel, But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Joey, Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!
Rachel, But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
Joey, You sure?!
Rachel, Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort  what’s he talking about?
Joey,  Oh hey-hey!
Ross,  Is everything okay?
Rachel, Yeah  everything’s fine!
Ross, Your page said come to the hospital  what? What was it? What happened?
Joey, Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Ross, Oh. Oh. Thank God  most women don’t even feel them.
Rachel, Okay  no uterus  no opinion.
Joey, Hey uh  what’s with the candy?
Ross, Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Rachel, Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Ross, No I—Mona!
Rachel, Oh  I gotta go back in there.
Ross, What? Why? What’s wrong?
Rachel, No  everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…
Ross, No really  you tell me what’s up.
Rachel, I-I forgot my underwear. 
Ross,  So  thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Joey, Oh hey  don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it  no big deal.
Ross, Yeah but still  I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
Joey, Oh uh  hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers!
Chandler, There has got to be a way!
Joey, Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh  do you have a bobby pin?
Chandler, Yeah.  Oh no wait  I’m not an nine-year-old girl.
Joey, Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler, Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey," Sure. ""Monica."""
Chandler, So  how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Joey, Uh  really good. Really good. Yeah  I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow  you sure found that quick.  I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way about Rachel anymore  y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean  I love living with her and God  helping out with the baby is just amazing  but now I think…I think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital  the doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s face.  By the way  I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey  did you try opening it with a credit card?
Chandler, That’s a good idea.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Okay.  So uh  Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Joey, Oh  I just…I feel terrible.
Chandler, Well  it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong.  Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if you’re in there  could you pass me my credit card?
Monica, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey.
Monica, I gotta tell you  yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Phoebe, No-no  I got that.
Monica, So umm  what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Phoebe, Okay. Okay but you should know though  I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, I mean $500.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, 600.
Monica, What’s going on?
Phoebe, Oh  you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Monica, What? 
Phoebe, Yeah  and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Monica, What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!
Phoebe, Really? There’s nothing sexual about this?  Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh.   What are you looking at?!  I mean hi.
Monica, Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God  I’m never gonna get massaged again!
Phoebe, No  you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look  I have  I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Monica, Really?!
Phoebe, Well not clients  lovers. But let’s just y’know  try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
Monica, Are you sure?
Phoebe, Yes.
Monica, I guess.
Phoebe, Great! Okay  if you’ll just excuse me.  So  did you hear something you liked?
Rachel, Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Ross, Hey uh  I brought you some lunch.
Rachel, Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this?
Ross, Well yeah!
Rachel, Oh Ross!! 
Ross, What?! What?! Rach what?!
Joey, What’s going on?
Ross, I made her favorite  tuna salad with pickles.
Joey, Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Ross,  I-I’m sorry Rach  I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
Rachel, Yeah  I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?
Joey, I’m on it! 
Ross, I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
Joey, Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Ross, Yeah? Not to you  because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
Rachel,  Well  if anyone is keeping score  I no longer eat tuna.
Joey, Hey uh  can I  can I talk to you guys for a second?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, What’s up?
Joey, Uh  sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Rachel,  Are you breaking up with us?
Joey, The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff  okay?  And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…
Rachel, Yeah?
Joey, Maybe you two should live together.
Rachel, Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Joey, Oh no-no  no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate  y’know it might as well be the father.
Rachel, But Joey  I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean——Or he does.
Ross, No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
Rachel, But Ross  its you and me!
Ross, So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
Joey, All right now  so? What do you think?
Rachel, I don’t know. Is it crazy?
Ross, No! No it’s not. Joey  this is a smart idea.
Joey, Well  I was due.
Rachel, Okay  let’s do it. I’ll move in.
Ross, Really?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. 
Chandler, Not to shabby  I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools.  Oh my God!
Monica,   How did you get in there?!
Chandler,  You’re messy.
Monica, Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!
Chandler, I married Fred Sanford!
Monica, No Chandler  you don’t understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.
Chandler, No  honey you’re not sick! Look  I don’t love you because you’re organized  I love you in spite of that.
Monica, Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?
Chandler, Yes! And look  now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we  can we share the closet.
Monica, Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.
Chandler, Hey.
Joey, Hey.
Chandler, So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Joey, Well uh  I wanted to have a few beers  but uh  I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh  it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date  so it’s got a bit of a kick.
Chandler, Are you okay?
Joey, Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah  I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone  I can uh  I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm  I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh  I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh  this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own  I’m uh  better off this way. I’m uh  a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! 
Monica, Ohhh.
Phoebe, That’s it. Just relax.
Monica, Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Phoebe, Come on more!
Monica, Oh God!
Phoebe, Yeah  you like that don’t you?
Monica, Oh yeah right there!
Phoebe, You want it there? You take it there baby!
Monica, Uh Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah  say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up  and umm we’re never doing this again.
Phoebe, Oh! Hey  Rach!
Rachel, Hi! Hey  Happy Valentine’s Day!
Phoebe, Oh  you  too.
Joey, Hey  so  uh  how’s it going living over at Ross’?
Rachel, It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages?  Oh  thank you. I’ll see you guys later.
Phoebe, Okay.
Joey, Bye.
Joey, There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Phoebe,  Honey  I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Joey, Thanks. But maybe later.
Phoebe, Oh  Gunther  can I get a scone?
Joey, You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!
Joey, Oh  okay.
Phoebe, So  how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Ross, Oh  I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah  she’s been away all week visiting her parents  but she’ll be cool. I mean  she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says  ‘Fossils are my friends.’
Phoebe, Ugh. Come on  Mona  don’t kiss ass.
Ross, Uh  I’m going to take off.
Phoebe, All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh  Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Ross, What is it?
Phoebe, It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
Ross, All right.  ‘Candy and Cookie?’
Phoebe, Yeah. Candy’s the mother  Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
Monica,  Phoebe  c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Phoebe, Oh  Monica  grow up!
Ross, Hey  what’s behind your back?
Monica, Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.
Ross, You don’t want my opinion?
Monica, Not really.
Ross, Come on  I’m your older brother  ask me!
Monica, All right  big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter  so your best friend would want to do her?
Ross,  The red one.
Phoebe,  Hey. Look  I know you’ve been really depressed lately  so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real  live  furry playmate.
Joey, No  I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Phoebe, He-hee!
Joey, Hey! A dog! Hi! Who  you got to admit  looks a lot like Jane.
Phoebe, This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now  you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
Joey, Thanks so much  Pheebs!  We are going to have so much fun  yes we are!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Chandler, Happy Valentine’s!
Monica,  Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable  and a little more slutty.
Chandler,  ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! 
Chandler, I love you  St. Valentine.
Chandler, Woah  woah  that’s not pretty!
Chandler, Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! 
Chandler, I am trying!
Joey, Get the ball  ready? Get the ball  get the ball!  Well  you’re cute  but you’re not too smart!
Joey,  Did I just throw this?
Rachel,  Hi.
Joey, Hi.
Rachel, I accidentally packed these with my stuff.  Who is this?
Joey, Oh  that’s  uh  that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is  but I call him Mozzarella.
Rachel,  Oh  well  you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more  but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting  yes I do. Yes I do.  Bye-bye  Joey. Oh  I seriously can’t stop it. 
Joey,  C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well  hey  you understand  right? You’re a guy.  Well  you used to be.
Monica,  So what do you think? 
Monica,  I’ve still got it!
Chandler,  Why did you get me this?
Monica, What is it?
Chandler, It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh  the dilating…
Monica, Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie  this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?
Chandler, I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
Monica, Chandler  if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day…  you were right! Apparently  it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city  you know  in search of stardom  but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah  it got four starts!  Oh  wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway  you want to take a look?
Chandler, Well  I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
Monica, Honey  what’s going on?
Chandler, Well  remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Monica, Mm-hmm.
Chandler, How long it took to go back in the water?
Monica, Chandler  we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!
Chandler, You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
Monica, Child-birth  it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.
Chandler, Oh  beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? 
Monica, Oh! Oh  my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
Chandler, See  honey  there’s—
Monica, Don’t touch me!
Ross, Hey!  So  how was Atlantic City?
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Wha—? Oh  come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know  most people think this is made with sea water  but it’s actually made with  uh  salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
Ross, I do too! I missed you!
Ross, Oh  it was good! It was good. Actually  the baby started kicking!
Ross, Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
Ross, Yeah  I’m missing out on all this other stuff  too. So  Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Ross, What?
Ross,  Huh…uh-huh.
Ross,  Just a second! 
Phoebe, How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Ross, I don’t know  she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um  plus  she  uh  she got me taffy!
Phoebe, Taffy  really? I’ve never had any.
Ross, Ever?!
Phoebe, Well  I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what  you’re just never going to tell her?
Ross, Oh  no  no  no  I will! I just want to butter her up  first! You know  I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff  and then  just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world  then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
Phoebe, If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky  lucky lady! So  where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff?  Oh  God. Is it gum  is it food? What’s the deal?  Oh  it’s nice! May I try a pink one?
Joey, So  between her and me being friends  and her history with Ross  it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey  buddy. How’s my favorite dog  huh? How’s my favorite dog?  You’re subdued.  Did you give him a beer?
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Will you excuse us  we need to talk for a moment.
Joey, Yeah  sure. Go ahead.  Oh  me  right!
Phoebe, He’s miserable! What happened to him?
Joey, Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Phoebe, What stuff?
Joey, Rachel stuff.
Phoebe, Oh…Joey  you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world  and he spends half a day with you  and look at him!
Joey, He’s breathing!
Phoebe, Okay  I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
Joey, No  no  no  no! He’s fine! Look  look  look!  Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!  Get your ball! My God  what have I done to you  huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs  I broke the dog!
Ross, Well  I’m  uh  going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
Rachel, Oh  I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way  and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Ross, Y’know  it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater  when in fact—
Rachel, Ross  we actually watched the documentary together.
Rachel, Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! 
Ross,  Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m  um  supposed to pick you up!
Ross, Ayyyayyyy!
Rachel,  Oh  hey  Mona!
Ross, I have no idea!
Rachel, I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. 
Ross, Uh…lately  she just likes hanging out here.
Ross, I think she’s lonely.
Ross, I know.
Ross, No  no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
Rachel, I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
Ross, Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional  but  but ballsy.
Rachel, You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats  and eat this in bed! 
Ross, And you thought she was going to be in our way! So  why don’t you  uh  open the champagne  and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.
Ross,  Please start drinking! 
Rachel,  I’m just going to grab the phone.
Rachel, Oh  I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?
Rachel,  But  but  Mona  I live here.
Ross,  Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.
Monica, How long has it been this time?
Chandler, 90 seconds.
Monica, That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.
Chandler, You know  it haunts me? Up ‘til now  the worst thing I ever saw  was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this  I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Monica, Okay  well  we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
Chandler, I can do that.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Monica, Oh  thank God!
Chandler, Oh  I know!
Monica, Come in!
Rachel,  Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s  but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
Monica, Oh  my God.
Chandler, Poor Ross.
Chandler, Oh  great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear  but for this he closes the drapes!
Monica, Rach  you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.
Chandler, Oh  and we should warn you  before you watch it: don’t watch it.
Rachel, Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Chandler, Well  let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Rachel, Well  now  wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on  you guys will watch it with me.
Monica, No  but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
Rachel, C’mon  seriously  you guys  you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
Monica, She’s right…of course not. Honey  get the tape.
Chandler,  This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay  here we go.
Rachel, Okay.  Ooh  my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Chandler, Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Monica, It’s…still beautiful.
Rachel, Uh! It’s horrible!
Monica, I know! I know  I’m so sorry for you!
Rachel, Oh  my God!
Chandler, Wait  you guys  look!
Rachel, What? Did her ass explode?!
Chandler, No  the baby’s out! Look  look!
Monica, Oh  look at those little fingers and toes!
Chandler, And look how happy the mom is now!
Monica, Oh…Rach!
Rachel, Oh  screw you guys  you don’t have to do it!
Ross, Hey  hey  man!
Joey, Hey  what’s up?
Ross, Uh…Mona just dumped me.
Joey, Oh  man  I’m sorry. Why?
Ross, Well  with everything that’s been going on lately  I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know  I  uh  I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment  and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way  I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner  you know?
Joey, Still  that really sucks  man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.
Ross, Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on  huh? Girl trouble?
Joey, Sort of.
Ross, Really?!
Joey, You don’t have to seem so happy about it.
Ross, Oh  sorry. Well  look  maybe I can help you with it.
Joey, Oh  I…I d—
Ross, Hey  whatever it is  I am sure it has happened to me. Y’know  actually once—once I got dumped during sex.
Ross, Anyway  so  uh  so what is it?
Joey, Forget about it. It’s no big deal.
Ross, C’mon! Joey! What is it?
Joey, It’s nothing.
Ross, Hey  hey  it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?
Joey, Okay  uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But  uh…it can’t happen.
Ross, She’s not a Tribbiani?
Joey, No!
Ross, I knew it. So  is she someone from work?
Joey, Yes.
Ross, Well  uh  does she like you?
Joey, Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter  because I can’t do anything about it.
Ross, Why not?
Joey, Well  it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work  too. And I could never do that to the guy  because we’re really good friends.
Ross, So  uh  this guy  she used to go out with  is  uh… is he still in love with her?
Joey, No. I don’t think so.
Ross, Okay. Um… is he a good guy?
Joey, Yeah  he’s the best.
Ross, Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Joey, Oh  I don’t know.
Ross, Joey  it’s worth finding out. I mean  if you really like her.
Joey, I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep  I—
Ross, Okay  Joey  you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you  huh? You owe it to yourself.
Ross, I’m going to…uh…I’m going to  um  put the bourbon in it at home.
Joey, Oh  yeah.
Ross, Anyway… seriously  uh…just…just talk to the guy  okay? And tell me how it goes. 
Joey, It’s Rachel.
Rachel,  You’re going to have a baby  and you need to be prepared. Now  you’re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it! 
Rachel,  Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
Joey, There’s this woman  that I like.  A lot.  Well  it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy  y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.
Ross, So  uh  this guy  she used to go out with  is  uh… is he a good guy?
Joey, Yeah  he’s the best.
Ross, Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Joey, Oh  I don’t know.
Ross, Joey  it’s worth finding out. I mean  if you really like her.
Joey, I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep  I—
Ross, Okay  Joey  you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you  huh? You owe it to yourself. 
Joey, It’s Rachel.
Ross,  Did you um—I’m sorry  did you just say it’s Rachel?
Joey, Yes.
Ross, Um  you…you like Rachel?
Joey, Yes. I like Rachel.
Ross, Rachel?!
Joey,  Yeah  okay but look  buy uh—Hey-hey  y’know  y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
Ross, But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!
Joey, Yeah  but it’s not a big deal.
Ross, It’s not a big deal? Oh  I’m sorry I just…um  I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about  I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
Joey, I’m an actor  y’know? As-as a group  we tend to be over dramatic.
Ross, Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
Joey, Look no  I-I know it’s bad  and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings  they’re gonna go away.
Ross, Y’know what? I-I gotta go. 
Joey, Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
Ross,  I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!
Rachel, Oh-oh! Okay  she’s kicking!
Chandler, Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
Rachel, Whoa!!
Chandler, Oh! 
Rachel, Wow that was a big one.
Chandler, I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Phoebe,  Oh hey you guys!
Chandler, Oh hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey listen let me ask you  do you believe in soul mates?
Rachel, Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
Phoebe, Uh-huh   and you?
Chandler, No. I mean I believe that uh  certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love  but soul mates  I don’t think they exist.
Phoebe, Okay  good.
Chandler, Why?
Phoebe, Well last night  I met Monica’s.
Chandler, What?
Phoebe, Yeah  I had a date with this guy  and I swear to God  he is her other half.
Chandler, Come on  don’t be crazy.  You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me  do ya? 
Rachel,  Well  what’s he like?!
Phoebe, Well he’s tall.
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, He has brown hair.
Rachel, Of course  of course.
Chandler, A tall guy with hair similar to mine  oh unknowable universe!
Phoebe, He works with food!
Rachel, Oh sure. Older?
Phoebe, Obviously  and he’s British.
Rachel, Oh  I was just gonna ask!
Phoebe, Yeah? And  he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
Rachel, Oh  it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Chandler, Luckily  the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
Phoebe, Oh  I’m so sorry. Um  and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again  I’ll find out more.
Chandler, You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
Phoebe, Well  he may not be my soul mate  but a girl’s gotta eat.
Monica, Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Monica, I just talked to Joey  I just—I want to see how you were.
Ross, Oh y’know  I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out  only weirder!
Monica, All right  I know you’re hurting  and-and I want to be supportive  but don’t say that again.
Ross, Oh my God! What if  what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
Monica, Honey  I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.
Ross, Sure  because women never like Joey. Y’know  I think he’s a virgin.
Monica, Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Ross, He’s not?
Monica, No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean  listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.
Ross, Why?
Monica, He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.
Ross, Hate him? I… No  I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel  y’know?
Monica, Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But  I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.
Ross, Okay. Okay  I’ll talk to him.
Monica, All right. Now do it soon  he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Phoebe, Oh! Hi!
Monica, Hi!
Phoebe, Umm  Chandler  Monica  this is Don.
Phoebe,  Soul mate.
Chandler,  What?
Phoebe,  Soul mate.
Monica, So  what have you guys been doing?
Monica, I know! What is this  1985?!
Monica, Not really.
Chandler, What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?
Monica, So Don  what-what other restaurants do you like?
Monica, Oh my God! That’s my restaurant  I’m the chef there.
Monica, No!
Monica, Oh  I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me  I’m gonna go with you.
Chandler, What are you doing?!
Phoebe, Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
Chandler, I believe in tall  handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe, They’re just talking  and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
Monica,  Phoebe  good work.
Phoebe, Yeah?
Monica, Yeah! Oh he’s great  I love him. 
Phoebe, Don’t worry  we’ll find you someone else.
Joey, Hey.
Ross, Hey.
Joey, Look  I understand if you came by to hit me  I deserve it.
Ross, No  I don’t want to hit you.
Joey, Oh what then? Kick me?
Ross, No.
Joey,  Bite me?
Ross, No  no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just  I just came here to say that. 
Joey, Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Ross, Uh…yeah sure. 
Joey, Do uh  do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…
Ross, Okay.
Joey,  Hey look Ross  you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing  okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 
Ross, Thank you.
Joey, Anyway  it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her  that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that  I mean I’ve never been in love before so…
Ross, What?! You’re in love with her.
Joey, Yeah  I thought you knew that.
Ross, Umm  no.
Joey," Wow. Hey look  if it helps  I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking  ""Ah  I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t  I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?"
Ross, I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Joey, Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
Ross, No  I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is  because if she’s not where you are  then you can start to move past this.
Joey, But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…
Ross, If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
Joey, Are you sure?
Ross, Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else  the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Joey, Hey thanks.
Ross, So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Joey, Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Ross, I’m understanding  but let’s not get carried away.
Joey, I’m sorry  you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!
Ross, Yeah  tell me about it. 
Chandler, Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work  huh Don?
Chandler, Cheese  it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Monica, Me too! Yeah  Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Monica, You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread  just cheese. No  I want the bread. Yeah. Ah  and pastries…  And pate. Oh  I’m really not high  it’s just I used to be fat.
Chandler, Is it made of cheese?
Monica, I’d move in tomorrow!
Chandler,  Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
Phoebe, I’m so sorry.
Chandler, What do we do?
Phoebe, I don’t know  they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
Joey, Okay. Okay  I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh  just stand up straight.  Take a couple deep breaths.  Look confident. 
Rachel, Joey? What’s up?
Joey, I uh  I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Rachel, Okay what’s up?
Joey, Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Rachel, Well honey  I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Joey, Okay umm  I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.
Rachel, Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? 
Joey, Okay. That’s good. Okay  that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah.  Don’t you people ever knock?!
Monica, I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?
Chandler, Sure  why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here  browsing through the personals.
Monica, Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
Chandler, Yeah  fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica, Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler, I’m sorry  did you say cheese?
Monica, All right  what’s going on?
Chandler, Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates  and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look  I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Monica, Chandler  you don’t believe in soul mates?
Chandler, No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
Monica, I don’t believe in soul mates either.
Chandler, You don’t?
Monica, No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Chandler, So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica, No  I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
Chandler, I love you.
Monica, I know.
Chandler, Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
Rachel, …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?
Joey, What? Yeah! Sure! Uh  look at the uh  the reason…—Is it hot in here?
Rachel, No. Not-not for me  but why don’t you take off your sweater?
Joey, I would  but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Rachel, Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Joey, Yeah. Sure. 
Rachel, Huh. Wow  I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
Joey, Uh… How long have we known each other?
Rachel, Um  seven…e-e-eight  eight years. Wow.
Joey, Uh-huh  long time.
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, But over the past few weeks…
Joey, Actually uh  could you give us a second?
Rachel, So you were saying?
Joey, I’m not quite sure.
Rachel," Okay  well you had asked me how long we had known each other  and I said  ""Eight years."" And the um  waiter came over and cut his tip in half  and umm…now here we are."
Joey, Yeah  here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.
Rachel,  What?
Joey, I’m falling in love with you.
Rachel,  Who are you talking too? Oh  you’re kidding! Oh  it’s a joke!  It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it.  Oh.  Okay. Umm… I-I…uh  wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
Joey, Does it really matter?
Rachel, Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow  it is hot in here.
Joey, Okay look Rach  I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh  you take as much time as you need.  Okay  you gotta say something!
Rachel, Joey  Joey I love you so much  but I…
Joey, But. 
Rachel, Joey.
Joey, Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh  pretty much what I was expecting. So uh  it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go. 
Rachel, No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on  you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 
Joey, Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach  ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.  Oh  here we go! 
Rachel, Can I? 
Joey, Sure!
Rachel, Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
Joey, Hey-hey-hey  hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!
Rachel, I’m so sorry.
Joey, Oh no-no Rach  please  don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.  Y’know I was only kidding you.
Rachel, Yeah  that was a real good one.
Rachel, Joey? Are you in there?
Joey,  Oh God! That’s Rachel!
Monica, Joey  you have to talk to her!
Joey, No-no  I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night  it’s just it’s…too weird  okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!  Don’t eat that! 
Rachel, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Hey Rachel!
Rachel, Is Joey here?
Chandler, I don’t see him.  Do you see him?
Monica, I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl!  Joey? Nope! 
Rachel, Well  at least you make each other laugh.
Monica, What’s up?
Rachel, Well  I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know  I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
Monica, We were playing a game.
Rachel, Ew  was Chandler naked? Sort of like a  like a ring toss kind of situation?
Monica, Sure.
Chandler, What?! No! No!
Rachel, All right. Well listen  if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. 
Monica,  Okay  did you hear that?
Joey, Yeah  a naked bagel game?   Dude  I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.
Monica, Honey  you gotta talk to her.
Joey, I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
Chandler,"  I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to  ""I love you "" was  ""Oh crap!"""
Monica, Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy  kids are mean when they’re hungry.
Joey, All right so  so what do I do?
Monica, This is Rachel. I mean  what are you gonna do  never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird  it’s awkward  but you gotta at least try.
Joey, Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your…
Chandler,  We didn’t play it!!
Phoebe, Okay  so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
Chandler, I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know  and-and y’know  one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
Monica, Okay  I’m done. Read mine.
Phoebe, Okay.  Ooh  I see a ladder.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
Monica,  I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
Phoebe, Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm  who’s next?
Rachel, Okay  I’m done. Do mine.
Phoebe, Okay.  Umm  oh! Okay  I see a circle.
Rachel, Ah.
Phoebe, Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!
Rachel, Well  I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Chandler, What does yours say Pheebs?
Phoebe, Umm… Wow  all right.  Wow! Yay! Ooh  I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. 
Ross,  Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down  like a  like a faded salmon?
Monica, You mean your pink shirt?
Ross, Faded salmon color.
Monica, No  I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.
Ross, Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
Chandler, Well  I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
Ross, That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Rachel, Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Ross, I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up  jump up my own ass and die. 
Phoebe,  Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore  the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. 
Chandler, Phoebe  did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People  what does that mean?
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Hey.
Rachel, Hi.
Joey, Hi.
Monica, Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Rachel, So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out  but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
Chandler, I know it’s tough now  but things will get better.
Rachel, How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse  to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!
Chandler, I’m not great at the advice  can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Monica, Honey  what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Chandler, Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Monica, Okay  where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Chandler, In the James Taylor case.
Monica, Where is the James Taylor CD?
Chandler, Honey  I’m gonna save you some time  200 CDs  not one of them in the right case.
Monica, Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh  we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
Chandler, Well  if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
Monica, Hmm  I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.
Rachel, Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Monica, Okay  I-I’m sorry. You and Joey  your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing  what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Rachel, Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Monica, Yeah  like I don’t know  maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Rachel, Ooh  I can do that.
Monica, Good.  Uh honey  the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Chandler, They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi.
Monica, Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach  I really don’t. I mean  maybe Joey can help you out with your  with your big work problem.
Rachel, What?
Monica, Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem  and it is a head scratcher. Wow!  Y’know what  if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. 
Joey, So you uh  have a…big work problem?
Rachel, Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.
Joey, Huh. Okay.  So uh  I think I’m gonna take off.
Rachel, Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.
Joey, Yeah?
Rachel, Yeah  and umm my baby.
Joey, Yeah?
Rachel, My boss wants to buy my baby!
Joey, What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Rachel, I know I told you  it’s a really big problem.
Joey, What he wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel, Can you believe that?!
Joey, That’s crazy!
Rachel, That’s what I told him!
Joey, Okay  how did this even happen?
Rachel," Well I’ll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm  and that—we were at the Christmas party  and he got drunk  and he said to me  ""Rachel  I want to buy your baby."""
Joey, Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Rachel, Ohh! Yeah!  Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.
Phoebe, Oh hello.
Phoebe, Oh Jim  Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe  Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
Phoebe, Well  maybe we will.  Oh! 
Ross, Mona?  Okay  if I were a salmon shirt  where would I be? 
Chandler, Oh my God  honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
Monica, Honey  both yours.
Rachel,  Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Monica, Yeah? The work problem?
Rachel, Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Chandler, What problem did you tell him you had?
Rachel, Oh that’s not important. The point is  I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
Joey, Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Phoebe, Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.
Phoebe, Oh  witty banter. Well done.
Phoebe, Oh okay  well I’m a masseuse  and I used to work at this place…
Phoebe, I-I-I like  I like parties.
Phoebe, Yeah I guess  a little.
Phoebe,  So! Umm  anyway I-I lived in New York  someone wildly I guess  for umm—Well since I was fourteen.
Phoebe, Oh stop it.
Phoebe, Okay. Umm look  you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt  because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So  why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, What?!
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Wow! You do?
Phoebe, All right. 
Chandler,  The sun’ll come out…tomorrow! Bet…your bottom dollar that tomorrow…  …there’ll be sun.
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey! Oh Joey  honey listen  thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Joey, Not a problem. Oh  and just so you know  that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Rachel,  What?
Joey, Let’s just say I took care of it.
Rachel, Whoa-whoa-whoa  let’s say more!
Joey," Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him  very nicely  ""You don’t go buying people’s babies  so back off!!"""
Rachel, What?!
Rachel, No! No  no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!
Joey, What?! Why?!
Rachel, So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!
Joey, And you couldn’t think of anything else?!
Monica, You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel,  I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
Chandler, You can always sell your baby.
Rachel, Oh Joey  I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
Joey, You lied to me!
Rachel, Well  she told me too! 
Monica, Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Ross, Hello!!
Ross, Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Rachel, Morning. You wanted to see me?
Rachel, Okay look Mr. Zelner…
Rachel, Yeah. 
Rachel, Oh God.
Rachel, Well  as long as we are clear about that. 
Phoebe, Oh there it is.
Monica, That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
Phoebe, I know  but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store  a new bank  a new adult bookstore  a new grocery store…
Monica, What?!
Phoebe, A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?  When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.
Monica, Don’t worry Phoebe  you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy  so can you.
Phoebe, Yeah  we both can. And we both will.
Phoebe, Oh  you didn’t have to come in with me.
Monica, Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts. 
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe, Oh yeah well  I’m sorry about that too  but what are you going to do?
Phoebe, A little.   Now you’re talking.
Phoebe, I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.
Monica,  Ooh  an ink stain! Hey  can I watch how you get this out?
Phoebe,  She must’ve left.
Rachel, Hi.
Joey, So? What-what-what happened?
Rachel, It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
Chandler, Wow  Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
Rachel, Chandler  can you give us a minute?
Chandler, Oh I’m sorry  you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
Rachel, Yeah.
Chandler, I’ll be in there. 
Rachel, Joey  I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…
Joey, I know. I know.
Rachel, It kinda worked. I mean y’know  I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.
Joey, Hey you’re right. Yeah  it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.
Rachel, Yeah I know! I miss that.
Joey, Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
Rachel, My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Ross,  Item J437-A  color: winterberry.  Hi umm  listen come here  come in.  I’m so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I’m really sorry. It’s just that I… 
Ross, You do?
Ross,  Oh God you’re right.
Ross,  No. 
Phoebe, Oh  Ross  Mon  is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?
Monica, Yeah.
Ross, Sure. Yeah.
Joey, So  who’s the guy?
Phoebe, Well  his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
Chandler, Oooh  did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?
Phoebe, Yeah  he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life  and he treats me like a queen  except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
Monica,  Oh  by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Ross, Uh  yeah  you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Monica, Yeah  I’d really like to.
Ross, Okay  hopefully this time mom won’t boo you.
Monica, Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast  and it’s always really moving  and always makes them cry. Well this year I’m going to make them cry.
Chandler, And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Monica," No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries  and hugs him  and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say  ""God  your brother."" Know what they’ll say this year? ""God  you"""
Joey, Well I can promise you  at least one person will be crying.  I’m an actor  and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. 
Monica, Really you can do that?
Joey, Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!
Chandler, What are you doing?
Monica, Oh I’m working on my toast for the party  or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. 
Chandler, It’s a dog.
Monica, It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
Chandler, It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?
Monica, The good stuff  huh?
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, You got a present for my parents. That’s so sweet.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary  I had a star named after them.
Ross, Aww that is so cool.
Joey, And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
Rachel, Hey  do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Chandler, Yeah  sure. What do you need? We got lace  satin  sateen  raffia  gingham  felt   and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Ross,  Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh  I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Monica, What?!
Ross, You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Everybody  this is Parker  Parker this is…
Chandler, Ha!
Ross, Ah  actually  I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
Rachel, I  uh  think you already are.
Monica, That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Monica, It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.
Ross, Well  there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
Monica, Okay  I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?
Chandler, Yeah.
Monica, And I’ve got the car keys.
Monica, Yeah.
Ross, So uh  he seems like a nice guy.
Rachel, Yeah  yeah I like him a lot.
Ross, Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Rachel, Yeah  otherwise I’m not going.
Ross, Hi!  Hey mom.
Rachel, This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive  do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
Ross, That’s a good question  dad. That’s a good question…
Rachel, Hmmm….
Rachel, Thank you…we’re so excited
Ross, Wha—What?
Ross, Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
Ross, Can you believe that?
Rachel, Yeah  if you’re going to do the ears  you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
Ross, No  us having to lie about being married.
Rachel, No  I know I don’t either  but ya know what  it’s their party  and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again  we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.
Ross, Hi Aunt Lisa  Uncle Dan
Rachel, Oh…
Rachel,  Unbelievable!
Ross, We love marriage!
Ross, Hey
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, I don’t think the flash went off.
Phoebe, I’ll go with you
Chandler, Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Joey, I have to go to the bathroom too  but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.
Ross, I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
Monica, He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Ross,  This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture!  Ooh sorry…
Phoebe, Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Ross, That depends  how much did you hear?
Phoebe, So  he a little enthusiastic  what’s wrong with that?
Monica, It’s just that  it’s so much.
Phoebe, Well  so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag  Janice  Mona? No  because friends don’t do that. But  do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion  your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap. 
Monica, I feel terrible.
Joey, I know
Ross, What was wrong with Mona?
Rachel, Open it! Open it! Open it!
Ross, Yeah baby!
Ross, No  no  it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
Rachel, But it was beautiful. I mean it was small  but kind of spectacular.
Rachel, On a cliff  in Barbados  at sunset  and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
Rachel, Yeah  Stevie’s an old family friend. 
Rachel, So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
Ross, Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?
Rachel, What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
Ross, Okay  okay. Ooooh  ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Rachel, Okay  Ross  it has to be realistic.
Phoebe, No  I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.
Phoebe, Hm huh  yeah.
Phoebe, No  that’s not necessary.
Phoebe, No  actually I don’t eat…
Phoebe, Okay  fine! Fine!  Mmm…hmmmmm….
Phoebe, Why don’t you just try one?
Chandler, What are you doin’?
Monica, Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.
Chandler, Ya know if you want to  I can just hold them down and you could .
Rachel, And my veil was lace  made by blind  Belgium nuns.
Rachel, Well  not at first  but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight  it was all worth it.
Rachel, Well  I don’t know about that  but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
Rachel, Oh yeah. That’s a great story.
Ross, Well  um  actually  I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um  she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies  her favorite flower…
Rachel, Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
Ross," Then  Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system  and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?"""
Rachel, And the ring  was the size of my fist !
Joey, Yeah uh  Phoebe! Look umm  I want to apologize about before  okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.
Phoebe, Then you better do it now.
Joey, Why?
Phoebe, Because I’m going to kill him
Joey, What-what?
Phoebe, You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life  but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.
Joey, I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet  and when I finally got up to the plates  I slipped on a giant booger!
Phoebe, Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
Joey, I guess it could’ve been  I didn’t really look at it. Y’know  I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.
Phoebe, He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
Joey, Oh hey  you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.
Phoebe, You think?
Joey, Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Phoebe, You’re right. You’re right  he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny  positive person.
Joey, Actually  you have a little bit of an edge.
Phoebe, What’s that now?
Joey, Nothing…
Phoebe, Oh look it’s Parker!
Phoebe, Oooh I love it!
Phoebe, Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
Monica, Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now  I know that Ross usually gives the toast  but this year I’m going to do it.
Monica, No  no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom  Dad  when I got married  one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough  but I love you.  When I look around this room  I’m-I’m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana  my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here  but she can’t because she’s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was.  Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she’s dead. Okay  her and Nana  gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment?  Didn’t see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania  who have been so neglected  they were incapable of love.  You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!
Ross, Oh  no  Mom  it’s just Monica this year.
Ross, No  of course  Um… Um  everybody? Um  I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride  Rachel   and myself. Umm  that if…if in 35 years  we’re half as happy as you guys are  we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Phoebe, Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
Phoebe, Oh thank God.
Phoebe, Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um  sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
Phoebe, Let’s try something else  let’s play a game.
Phoebe, Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest. 
Phoebe, But  let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Oh my God!
Phoebe, Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights  Parker!
Phoebe, You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
Phoebe, No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac  at Disneyland  getting laid!
Phoebe, Much less happy!
Phoebe, So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out! 
Phoebe, Uh huh. 
Ross, …and then  we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
Rachel, Ross  it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
Ross, But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?
Rachel, It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Ross, Yeah! And! And  it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.
Rachel, Okay Ross  can I uh  can I ask you something?
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, That proposal  at the planetarium…
Ross, I know  I know it was stupid.
Rachel, Are you kidding?! With the  with the lilies  and-and the song  and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
Ross, No  actually I thought about it when  when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh  I would ask you to marry me.
Rachel, Well  that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
Ross, It’s a good thing I didn’t do it  because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay  good night
Rachel, Goodnight
Ross, Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?
Rachel, I will think about it.
Ross, That’s all I’m askin’
Monica, Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary  you’re the one giving the speech.
Ross, Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Monica, Oh  come on.
Ross, Hey! All that stuff you said about true love  you were right  I mean  we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh  yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Monica,  Oh good God  Ross! How the hell do you do it?
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, So  I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle  and guess who the clue is for three down. 
Joey,  Three down  Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!
Monica, How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! 
Joey, Yeah you are baby.
Monica, Three down knows I’m married  what’s three down doin’?
Rachel, So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
Joey, No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me  but I said no.
Ross, Why’d you say no?
Joey, Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines  and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Chandler, If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. 
Rachel, Oh  come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time  and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention  oh I don’t know  gal pal Rachel Green?
Chandler, Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Rachel, Okay  don’t listen to him. Please?
Joey, Fine! All right  I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know  start to say something stupid.
Ross, Just then or-or all the time  ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
Rachel, Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously  proud of you.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Oh  not at all. Happy to do it.
Monica,  You think we’re being obvious?
Chandler, No  we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. 
Joey,  Actually  I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered  I’m doing this for the fans  not for the free food.
Joey, And I’ll have all the muffins.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Ross, Shhh! We’re not talking.
Phoebe, Oh. Finally! Oh. 
Joey, 
Joey, Oh  you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Joey,  Wow  it is easy.  Now  I can have milk everyday.
Joey, Yeah  I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship   and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return  200 years from now  you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up  because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.
Joey, Shh  OK  here I come  here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier  I can't get to the copier  I'm thinkin' what do I do  what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say  wait  here's my line   you know that's bad for the paper tray.
Chandler, Nice work my friend.
Joey, Thank you. Wait-wait-wait-wait  you see me again. Hang on  the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am  there I am  there I am  there I am  there I am…
Joey, Well  there are so many things  it’s hard to pick just one.
Phoebe, I’m gonna get some coffee  anyone want anything?
Rachel, Oh yeah  I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Ross, Uh  double latte  extra foam.
Chandler, And a bagel with only…
Phoebe,  I was just being polite!
Joey,  Look at this clown! Just because he’s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
Rachel, That is the Coast Guard.
Joey, What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there. 
Chandler,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Joey,  Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
Chandler, Well  I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Ross,  Come on  it's fun!
Chandler, All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey, Dude  stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Chandler, Y’know what  we have to turn off the porn.
Joey, I think you’re right.
Chandler, All right  ready?
Joey, One.
Chandler, Two.
Joey, That’s kinda nice.
Chandler, Yeah  that’s kinda a relief.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, FREE PORN!!!
Joey, Yeah!!
Chandler, We have free porn here!!!
Joey, In my spare time I uh  read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids. Y’know a mento  a role model. 
Joey, Right.
Joey, Matter of fact  I do.
Joey, Uh  we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Joey, Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball  without dropping it  for like an hour?
Ross, Are you serious?!
Joey, Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Ross, Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey, Oh  I-I  I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah  my pants are a little loose!
Chandler, What’s wrong with you?
Joey, Nothing! Well  I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before  then I uh passed out and uh  haven’t been able to stand up since. But um  I don’t think it’s anything serious.
Chandler, This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!
Joey, No way! ‘Kay look  if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
Rachel, It’s a trifle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers  then a layer of jam  then custard  which I made from scratch.  Then raspberries  more ladyfingers  then beef saut�ed with peas and onions   then a little more custard  and then bananas  and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
Ross, It tastes like feet!
Joey, I like it.
Ross, Are you kidding?
Joey, What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
Joey, The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts  ice cream  limes—Hey  what was in that brown jar?
Chandler, That’s still in there?!
Joey, Not anymore.
Rachel, Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!
Chandler, Stick to your side!
Rachel, Hey  come on now!
Joey,  All right  what are we havin’? 
Joey, Uhh  I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know  just everything in moderation.
Joey, I’ll take those to go.  For the kids.
Joey, It was so stupid  I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me  that’s not gonna happen today.
Joey, Well  I said that I… 
Joey, You guys  this is Shelley  she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest  and Shelley  this are my friends…
Rachel,  Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green  and if you want the dirt  I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby   who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously   gal pal Rachel Green.
Ross,  Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Joey, Okay.
Monica, Joey! You’re doing great!
Ross, Yeah  so far nothing stupid.
Chandler, Mento?
Joey, No thanks.
Ross, Uh no  no just-just that he is a great guy.
Rachel,  Yeah  that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I……I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Phoebe, Umm  I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
Phoebe, Umm  Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe, Oh okay  it’s P as in Phoebe  H as in hoebe  O as in oebe  E as in ebe  B as in bee-bee and E as in  ‘Ello there mate!

Joey, How come you have two?
Chandler, Well this one's for you.
Joey, Get out.
Chandler, No  I can't. No-no  listen  I  I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry   it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds.
Joey, Wow  is this friendship? I think so. Check it out  we're bracelet buddies.
Chandler, That's what they'll call us.
Rachel, Oh  Joey! Sorry!
Joey, No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Rachel, Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!
Joey, Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Rachel, Really?
Joey, Yeah! Look! 
Rachel, I’ve never lived like this before.
Joey, I know.
Joey, All right  don’t waste it  I mean its still food. 
Ross, All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this  because I wanna be a good friend  and damnit I am a good friend. So just  just shut up and close your eyes .
Joey, Wow  you are a good friend  'course the audition was this morning  and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Joey, All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.  And they're off! 
Phoebe, Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Joey, Judge rules  no violation.
Phoebe, Ohhh.
Joey, And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Phoebe,  No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter  that's just an old Wonton!
Joey, Judge rules  Nutter-Butter.
Phoebe, Ohh  tough call.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Ross, Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel  yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Monica, You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried  but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... 
Joey, That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too  I’d pee on anyone of you!
Joey, Umm  no. No best friend  no. Just a lot of close friends.
Joey, Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!
Chandler, It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Joey, What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first  I thought it just looked good  but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross, Your make-up!
Ross, Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Joey, I think face to face.
Ross, I would say that.
Joey, Face to face  yeah!
Ross, Okay  here I go.
Joey, All right.
Joey,  Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross, I prefer not to answer that right now  I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Joey, Y’know  when we talked about face to face  I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
Joey, Hey Pheebs! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!
Phoebe, Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Chandler, You’re turning into a woman.
Joey, No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
Chandler, Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
Joey, It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God  I’m a woman!!!
Joey, Great nap.
Ross, It really was.
Joey, Uh me? Gay? No! No. No  but I have a number of close friends who are. 
Joey," Oh-oh-oh-oh  how I do it is  I look a woman up and down and say  ""Hey  how you doin’?"""
Phoebe, Oh  please!
Joey,  Hey  how you doin’?
Joey, Hey! How you doin’?
Joey, I’d love to show ya  but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.  Hey uh  would you two girls like to go for a drink? 
Rachel, Oh my God  Jill!
Chandler, Oh my God  introduce us!
Rachel, This is Chandler. 
Rachel, And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross, Hi Jill.
Rachel, And that’s Phoebe   and that’s Joey.
Joey, Hey   how you doin’?
Rachel, Don’t!! 
Joey, Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me  you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Joey, Oh  I do.  How you doin?
Joey, What?!?! Oh dear God!
Joey, Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
Joey, Oh great! Great! Thank you. 
Joey, Bye-bye.  I did it!
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, Amazing! Amazing!
Joey, Oh  I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me  I have a life  y’know?
Joey, Oh  good to know.  So close!
Rachel, Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
Joey, Yeah  I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Monica, You slept with her didn’t you?
Joey, Little bit  yeah.
Ross, Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Joey, Oh yeah  that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. 
Ross, Did you just wink at me?
Joey, Hey  you’re the one that loves the picture.
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?
Phoebe, About twenty  a couple people from work who had something else to do.
Monica, Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Rachel, What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care  as long as my mom’s here.
Monica, Oh my God  your mother!
Rachel, What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!
Monica, Well  given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Rachel, My God!
Monica, Well it wasn’t my fault  Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
Phoebe, Well I don’t  I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…
Monica,  Oh give it a rest!
Rachel, So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Phoebe, No.  Neither is mine.
Monica, Okay  y’know what? Don’t worry  okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.
Rachel, Please  make sure she comes. It’s really important to me  I mean it’s my mom!
Phoebe, I know. I know  what’s her number?
Rachel, I don’t know.
Monica, Go! I have it in my book. Go!   Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi  it’s Monica Geller.
Monica,  Hi  umm I know this is last minute  but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
Monica, Yeah  I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.
Monica,  Oh my God  my ass is sweating!  Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.
Monica, Thank you. 
Phoebe, Isn’t it at three?
Monica, Son of a bitch! 
Chandler, Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Joey, Oh no  I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
Ross, Oh cool!
Chandler, That’s great.
Joey, Yeah-yeah  and if I get it by day I’ll  Dr. Drake Remoray  but by night I’ll be  Joey Trrrribbiani!
Chandler, You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!
Joey, But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
Ross, Well do you want some help?
Joey, Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
Ross, Awesome!
Chandler, Okay  I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Joey,  All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
Chandler, Bamboozled?
Joey, Yeah  isn’t that a cool name?
Ross,  Yeah!
Chandler,  No!
Joey, All right. Uhh  okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Ross, Well uh  I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm  I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh  hi Ben!  And uh…
Joey, I said a little bit Ross. Now  how about you Chandler?
Chandler, Well Joey  I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! 
Joey, Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler  you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Chandler, Bogota.
Joey, It’s Ba-go-ta  but close enough. Now  you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
Chandler, What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Joey, I should know that. Let’s see  just one moment please. Umm  here we are  a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Chandler, Higher or lower than what?
Joey, This is embarrassing. 
Chandler,  Can you believe how lame this is?
Ross, I’m sorry  I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Phoebe, Oh  I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?
Monica, You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Phoebe, What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Monica, Hi!
Phoebe, I’m so glad you could make it.
Monica, Yes  thank you so much. And again  we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Monica, She’s still mad.
Phoebe, Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Monica, Phoebe  Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?
Phoebe, No look  we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
Monica, Okay. I can do that.  I gotta go powder my ass.
Rachel, Okay. 
Rachel, Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh  I don’t even have a housekeeper.
Rachel, Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah  she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it  tu madre es loca. 
Rachel, Well  however great she was I just can’t afford that.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Wh-wh-what? What?
Rachel, Yes. Yes I do.
Joey, All right Ross you’re in the lead  would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Ross, The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh  I’ll take another question.
Joey, Okay  this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Ross, It’s okay  I’m ready.
Joey, No dude  you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.
Chandler, This is ridiculous  he’s not gonna hold his breath… 
Joey, Okay  what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia  Tris…Holy cow  that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler  how do you say that?
Chandler, Let me see that.
Joey, This one right here. 
Chandler, Triscadecaphobia.
Ross,  The fear of Triscuts!
Joey, No! No  fear of the number 13.
Chandler, Fear of Triscuts?
Ross, It’s possible  they have really sharp edges.
Joey, All right Chandler  you’re up.
Ross, Wait a minute  I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
Chandler, This game makes no sense!
Ross, Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
Chandler, Oh come on Ross  I think we’re all losers here.
Joey, All right. Chandler  you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Chandler, Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
Joey, You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Chandler, Either  it makes no difference.
Joey, Choose  you jackass!
Chandler, I’ll take a card.
Joey, Okay  you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!
Ross, What?!
Chandler, This game is kinda fun.
Ross,  You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
Chandler, I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Rachel, Why did you invite my mother?!
Monica, What?
Rachel, She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Phoebe, For how long?
Rachel, Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother  but my God  a long lunch with her is taxing.
Monica, I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Phoebe, She can’t hear you.
Rachel, What? You guys  come on! What am I going to do?
Phoebe, Well  if you don’t want your mother to move in with you  just tell her.
Rachel, You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby  I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
Monica, That’s right. That is right  you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Rachel, Okay. 
Monica,  This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Phoebe, I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!
Monica, Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby  because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Phoebe, How about you less important people  let’s open your presents!
Rachel, Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!
Rachel, Oh yeah. Okay  see mom  the truth is I can do this on my own.
Rachel, But mom  I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.
Rachel, He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Phoebe, Okay  come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
Rachel, Wow!
Phoebe, Okay  this is from your friend at work.
Rachel, Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh  I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
Rachel, Did I say I was done guessing? Okay  thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?
Rachel, Oh  it dispenses clean diapers!
Rachel, Well that’s gross  why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
Rachel, What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
Monica, Rachel  listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Rachel, I don’t know  I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!
Rachel, Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me  the baby dummy. Oh God  okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm  I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later  but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts  and this basket is beautiful.
Rachel, Okay mommy  don’t ever leave me. 
Joey,"  In what John Houston film would you hear this line  ""Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!"""
Chandler, Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Joey, Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!
Chandler, Madre Sierra the of Treasure!

Joey,  That noise can only me one thing.
Chandler,  Hungry monkey.
Ross,  Hungry monkey!  Haaa!  I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
Joey, Okay  it’s an audio question  name this television theme song. 
Ross,  Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay  I know this  give me-give me a second!

Joey, Of course!
Joey, Who invented bifocals?

Joey, Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Ross, Queen Victoria.
Joey, Correct again! But  you forgot to switch legs between questions  so no hopping bonus!
Ross, Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Joey, Now  over to Chandler.
Chandler, I’d like a Google Card.
Joey, Are you sure?
Chandler, Yes!  No!  Google!
Joey, Oh my God! Congratulations Ross  because Chandler  you’ve been Bamboozled!
Chandler, Nooo!!
Ross, Yeah!!
Chandler, This is the best game ever!!!
Rachel, So umm  you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Rachel, Oh mom  I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth  but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh  can I throw up in my diaper genie?
Rachel, Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot.
Ross,  Hey!
Phoebe, Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Ross, I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Phoebe, Not if you were here.
Ross, Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Rachel, Oh we did  but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Ross,  A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Rachel, No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.
Ross, Uh  what?
Rachel, Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo. 
Ross, What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman  but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
Ross, Hi roomie! 
Joey,  It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.
Joey,  Rightie-O Ray!
Joey,  Hello  I’m Joey Tribbiani! Let’s play Bamboozled! Erin  you get the first question! In hockey  who is known as The Great One?
Joey, Correct! Now  would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Joey, What—Why?!
Joey, Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!
Joey, Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?
Joey,  Let’s play Bamboozled!
Ross, Well we…we don’t have a garage.
Ross, Y’know what? Maybe  Mrs. Green  it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Rachel, I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
Ross, I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
Rachel, Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Phoebe, No  not a thing.
Monica, It’s frightening.
Ross, Well uh  y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything  I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together  and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time  by myself.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, That’s a different issue. Uh  the point is  when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Ross, Yes! Yes  you’re gonna be so missed.
Ross, Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma. 
Rachel, Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
Ross, Oh  come on  every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look  y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
Rachel, I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
Ross, Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
Rachel, Really?
Ross, I’m telling you.
Rachel, Thank you. 
Ross, Oh. 
Monica,  You’re still so funny. You’re so funny.  What do I do?
Phoebe, Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely  albeit slightly boring  shower  and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.
Monica, Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.
Phoebe, Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her  I’d tell her off.
Monica, Really?
Phoebe, Uh-huh!
Monica, Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah  and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you  it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Monica, That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
Phoebe,  Wrap it up  wrap it up  wrap it up…
Monica, So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me  I will forgive you. Good day!  I can’t feel my legs!
Phoebe, You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
Monica, Yeah? I’m proud of me too.
Phoebe, You should be!
Monica, Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Phoebe, You got it!
Monica, Okay.  Mrs. Green! Okay I’m really sorry!! I’m apologizing for the—  Okay  I bit my tongue  but I’m still really sorry!
Rachel,  Okay! I’m ready.
Ross, You sure?
Rachel, Yes  I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.
Ross, All right then.  Rachel Green! Let’s play Bamboozled!  How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
Rachel, Uh  put your elbow in it.
Ross, Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Rachel, Full  dry  on its back  and no loose covers.
Ross, That’s correct! This is an audio question  what do you do when the baby makes this sound? 
Rachel, Check if it’s wet  check if it’s hungry  burp it!
Ross, Excellent! Excellent  now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
Rachel, A card! A card! I pick a card!
Ross, Oh  I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother!  I’ve lost sight of why we’re doing this! 
Ross, Hey you guys I got some bad news. 
Phoebe," Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try  ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"""
Ross, No  Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.  I didn’t want her to see it  so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find. 
Joey," Man  this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  ""Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."""
Monica,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Monica,  Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Ross, Umm…
Monica,  Oh dear God!
Ross, But the good news is  no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
Monica, What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Ross, Yeah  they all know.
Monica, Oh my God  this is horrible!
Chandler, I’m so sorry.
Monica, I’m so humiliated!
Rachel," Yeah but y’know what they say Mon  ""There’s no such thing as bad press."""
Monica," You don’t think that umm   ""The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful "" is bad press?"
Rachel, I didn’t write it.
Monica, Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?
Joey, Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me  okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend  I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!
Rachel, Ross!
Ross,  What?! What?
Rachel, I am freaking out!
Ross, Are ya?
Rachel, My due date is in one week!
Ross, What are you doing up?
Rachel, That is seven days!
Ross, Okay look  I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
Rachel,  No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please  come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
Ross, It’s funny you should mention diapers.
Rachel, I’m serious.
Ross, Okay look  there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow  we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Rachel, Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…
Ross,  Okay. Okay. If uh  if you’re gonna do this  then I’m gonna do that.  So… 
Rachel,  Oh  wait Ross! I’m sorry  one more thing!
Ross,  Yeah!
Rachel, Umm  our situation. Y’know umm  what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together  and we live together. Isn’t that  isn’t that weird?
Ross,   Well uh…
Rachel, I’m just kidding! You can go pee! 
Joey,  Hey uh Monica  I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
Monica, We said at the movies  but…
Joey, Okay  I’ll see you there. 
Monica, Joey!  Now that you’re here…
Joey, Sure  I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?
Chandler, I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
Joey, I thought you already have a job.
Chandler, And people say you don’t pay attention. No  this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Joey, Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Chandler, That’s what I do now.
Monica, Hey Joey  come taste this.
Joey, What is it?
Monica, Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well…  I’m getting my revenge!
Joey, You cooked him?
Monica," No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School  so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh  I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! ""Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."""
Chandler, The front page? You really do live in your own little world  don’t ya?
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Oh.
Rachel, No-no-no! No  no  no  we’re not married.
Ross, We are having a baby together  but we’re not involved.  I mean  uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago  but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night.  Or  yes stranger  we’d like this delivered please.
Ross, Oh  okay.
Rachel, Oh yeah! Actually  that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.
Ross, I chose those  I’m a paleontologist.
Rachel, Oh. Oh yeah  don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor  but he’s not.
Ross, Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Rachel, Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register  holding a credit card  and I’m bored.
Ross, That’s my gym.
Ross, I am like Indiana Jones.
Rachel, Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe, Hey! Oh  how did baby shopping go?
Rachel, Oh  it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross  almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.
Phoebe, What?!
Rachel, Well  we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
Phoebe, Well did she know you two weren’t married?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man  we-we must alert the church elders!
Rachel, You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.
Phoebe, Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
Rachel, No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!
Phoebe, Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?
Chandler,  Hey Phoebe!  Fatty!
Phoebe, Hey Chandler  why so fancy?
Chandler, Well  I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Phoebe, Wait  I think I know someone who does that.
Chandler, Me! I do that. So… Seriously  do I look okay? I’m little nervous.
Rachel, Oh yeah! You really—You look great.
Phoebe, Yeah  just don’t get your hopes up.
Chandler, Why not?
Phoebe, Well  the interview…
Chandler, What about it?
Phoebe, Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
Chandler,  What?!
Phoebe, Oh you don’t know.
Chandler, Are you serious?!
Phoebe," Yes  when I first met you  you were like  ""Blah  blah  blah."" I was like  shhh!"
Chandler, What is it that I do?
Phoebe, Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes  y’know  you just—You come off a little needy.
Chandler,  Did you like me when we first met?
Rachel, Chandler  I’m not gonna lie to ya  but I am gonna run away from you. 
Monica, Hi! Umm  I’m Monica Geller  I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.
Monica, I think the things that you said about me are really unfair  and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
Joey, Either eat it  or be in it.
Monica, Spoon?  So  what do you think?
Joey, Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.
Monica, I can.
Monica, Well umm  they both have a egg yolk and butter base  but a bearnaise has shallots  shirvel  and most importantly tarragon.
Monica, Monica.
Monica, Okay. 
Rachel, All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh  how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
Ross, My son? Pretty serious.  Oh hey Katie!  What uh  what are you doing here?
Ross, Ah  must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
Ross, Oh. 
Ross, Oh! Wow! Uh  yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this  back in my pocket  pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah  actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…
Rachel, Horny bitch.  No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!
Rachel, So you guys go  have a really good time.
Ross,  Yeah  I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh  and my whip.  Y’know because of the Indiana Jones?  Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&M.  I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex.  So  I’m gonna grab my coat. 
Rachel, So  you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
Rachel, Oh yeah! Yeah please  you guys have fun.
Rachel, Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic  although you missed a button.
Rachel, Oh okay  I see what you’re doing there.
Chandler, I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Phoebe, Oh! It’s okay  you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Chandler, Oh good. Good  because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
Phoebe, All right  don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
Chandler, An hour.
Phoebe, I can’t help you.
Chandler, Phoebe!
Phoebe," All right  all right  we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. ""Hi! Come on in  I’m uh  Regina Philange."""
Chandler, Chandler Bing.
Phoebe, Bing  what an unusual name.
Chandler, Well you should meet my uncle  Bada.  I’ll let myself out.
Joey, Hi.
Joey, When you say used  do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
Joey, Cheese makes me thirsty.
Joey, All right.
Monica, Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the  when the water makes those little bubbles.
Monica, I-I-I’m sorry  your-your mouth was full  I didn’t hear what you said. Umm  hats off to who now?
Monica, That’s right.
Chandler, …I think you’ll find if I come to work here  I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.
Phoebe, Um-hmm  that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do  and start focusing on what you do do.
Chandler,  What I do do…is manage to uh  create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
Phoebe, I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Chandler, Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.
Phoebe, You gotta go!
Chandler, Oh! 
Phoebe, Okay  don’t worry. You’re ready.
Chandler, Really?
Phoebe, Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Y’know  you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now  no pressure  you like my cookies  you give me the star. 
Monica, Wow! A star!  I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry  but I don’t care.
Joey, I can an A? In-in school?  Hey  I’m a dork.
Monica, Joey! I’m so proud of you!
Monica, Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!
Monica, I do! I’m a professional chef!  Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!
Joey, Yeah!
Monica, I’m-I’m sorry  it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant  Alessandro’s  and umm I just got a really bad review…
Monica, You do?
Monica, Oh  I’m totally crazy  but you-you like the food?
Monica, Okay then  I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. 
Joey, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.
Joey, Hey-hey-hey  if my friend says it’s time to go  it’s time to go. 
Chandler, …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Chandler, That I did. That I did.
Chandler,  My duties?  All right.
Chandler,  I see.
Chandler,  Good to know.
Chandler, No don’t I beg of you!
Chandler,  Really?!
Chandler, Yeah I gotta say thank you  I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong  make to many jokes  and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo. 
Chandler, Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over  that was the real Chandler Bing in there  this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!
Chandler, I’ll look forward to your call. 
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hi! You’re back from your date!
Ross, How are you?
Rachel, I’m fine  but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?
Ross, Uhh  it was fun. We  we just had coffee.
Rachel, Oh uh-huh  uh-huh  coffee  a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
Ross, What’s uh  what’s going on? Do you not  do you not like Katie?
Rachel, No! No  she’s—She was nice. I mean  she’s a little slutty  but who isn’t?
Ross, I liked her.
Rachel, Of course you did Ross  you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Ross, Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
Rachel, No! It’s just that  Kate bothered me.
Ross, Why? What was wrong with her?
Rachel, There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Ross, Okay  so what’s the matter?
Rachel, I don’t want you to date her!
Ross,  Why? What  what are you jealous?
Rachel, Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me  but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this  and it’s completely inappropriate  but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry  but that is just the way that I feel.
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, What?!
Ross, I won’t date. I’ll uh  I’ll be here  with you  all the time.
Rachel, Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
Ross, True  but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.
Rachel,  Oh Ross  thank you. Thank you. 
Ross, Do you feel better?
Rachel, No  not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry. 
Ross, Uh Rach?
Rachel, Yeah. 
Ross, Just one thing umm…
Rachel, Uh-huh.
Ross, We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?
Rachel,  Wow! I don’t know  maybe. I’m…
Ross, Oh-oh  Rach! I was just messin’ around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Rachel,  I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
Ross,  Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…
Rachel, Oh no-no-no-no  no!
Ross, …that you actually…
Rachel, No that’s just——That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!
Ross, Rach?
Rachel, Yeah?
Ross, The bathroom?
Rachel, Right! 
Joey, Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake  ate great food  that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade  and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.
Monica, Oh  look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
Joey, What the hell!
Monica, Okay.
Joey, Yeah  this was a stupid idea. 
Ross, Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Joey, Oh  it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in  check it out.
Ross, Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Joey, Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!
Ross, Now I cannot wait to see this.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  it’s already generating Oscar buzz.
Phoebe, I started that!
Joey, I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited! 
Monica, Are we gonna take a limo?
Joey, Sure! Why not?!
Monica, Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Rachel, Well obviously I won’t be able to come  for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know  I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part  I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
Rachel, That’s right  still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
Ross, Uh sweetie  maybe you’d be more comfortable here? 
Rachel, You. Like you haven’t done enough.
Ross, Look  I-I know how miserable you are  I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.  Because with seahorses it’s the male  they carry the babies. And then also umm  I’d be far away in the sea. 
Rachel, God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Phoebe, Oh I know  I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
Rachel,  Oh Phoebe  that’s a great story. Can you tell it to me when you’re getting me some iced tea?   Oh God  get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!
Chandler, Let’s. 
Chandler, Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Rachel, Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
Monica, What are you doing here so early?
Rachel," They sent me home from work. They were like  ""Start your maternity leave now! Just rest  get ready for the baby."" Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there  I’ll just hang out with you guys."
Phoebe, Or you can do volunteer work.
Joey, Hello?
Joey, One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Joey, Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Joey,  Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Rachel,  What-what about me?
Joey, You said you didn’t want to go.
Rachel, I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.
Joey, Definitely not invisible.
Monica, Well  well Ross didn’t care enough to be here  so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.
Chandler, He’s not snoozing  he’s teaching a class.
Monica, Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey  not that this uh should affect you at all  but if you were to pick me  I was planning on wearing a sequined dress  cut down to here. 
Chandler, I haven’t seen this dress.
Monica, Star in a movie.
Phoebe, Joey  you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe  Phoebe.
Joey, Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe,  Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! 
Chandler, You really want to take me?
Joey, Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry  I wish I can take everybody  but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Chandler, So you’re never actually going to pay me back?
Monica, Wait a minute  just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey  I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
Joey, It’s not just the stuff he paid for  I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous  and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even  even when I didn’t believe in myself.
Chandler, I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.
Joey, Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Phoebe, Mon  maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Joey,  I’m gonna go shave. 
Chandler,  Yeah well  I’m gonna go spit. 
Rachel, Oh  I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. 
Phoebe, When she comes out  you hold her nose  I’ll blow in her mouth  and the kid will just  right out of her.
Monica, She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today  right?
Phoebe, I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
Monica, Hmm  care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.
Phoebe, You’re on!
Monica, Okay  how much?
Phoebe, One hundred thousand dollars!
Monica, How about fifty bucks?
Phoebe, Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
Rachel,  All right  who’s turn is it to help me get up!
Phoebe, No one’s here!  Oh damnit!
Chandler, This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
Joey, A little tall.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Do you mind crouching down a little bit  so that I look taller?  There you go. 
Chandler, It’s just so glamorous.
Phoebe, Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh  you’re still pregnant. Oh  I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah  like fifty bucks.
Rachel, Oh  I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. 
Monica, Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! 
Phoebe, It’s interesting that you lost. Now  I forget  do you like to lose?
Monica, Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Phoebe, Fine! You’re on!
Monica, Okay.
Phoebe, Until then  General Grant  why don’t you set up camp  right there.
Ross,  Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
Monica, She’s in the bathroom.
Ross, Rach  we gotta go.
Rachel, In a minute!!!
Ross, People ask me why we’re not together  I just don’t know what to tell them.
Rachel,  All right  all right. Let’s go!
Ross, Uh  do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us  but if you hurry…
Rachel, No  I’m fine.
Ross, Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. 
Phoebe, Good God man don’t anger it.
Rachel, Ross  it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks  I am somewhat comfortable.
Ross, Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
Rachel, Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. 
Monica, I’m actually with her on this one.
Joey,"  ""I thought I knew who the enemy was  but it was you all along."""
Joey,  Okay  this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. 
Rachel, Ross.
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, Can I ask you something?
Ross, Uh-huh.
Rachel, When Carol was pregnant with Ben…
Ross, Mmm?
Rachel, …were you this irritating?
Ross, Wow!
Rachel, Excuse me?!
Ross, Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh  you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
Rachel, Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Ross, Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon  why don’t we not speak until then.
Rachel,  Okay.  Seriously  breathe louder Ross! That’s great!
Ross, Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
Rachel, Hi Dr. Long  how are you?
Ross,  Oh  you’re nice to her.
Rachel, She has the drugs!
Rachel, Okay. 
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Eh  just a tad.
Ross, Do them!!
Rachel, Well  we are ready to try anything.
Rachel, Okay.
Rachel, Great! We will do all of those.
Ross, You’ve got to be kidding me!
Chandler, Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Joey, You liked it? You really liked it?
Chandler, Oh-ho-ho  yeah!
Joey, Which part exactly?
Chandler, The whole thing! Can we go?
Joey, Oh no-no-no  give me some specifics.
Chandler, I love the specifics  the specifics were the best part!
Joey, Hey  what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Chandler, I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Joey, You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. 
Chandler, Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or  call an ambulance.
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hi!
Monica, What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Rachel, No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross, Yeah  we tried them all. We went for a walk  uh we tried a special tea  caster oil  spicy food nothing has worked.
Rachel," Well  there is one thing that we haven’t tried  but someone thinks that   ""That will open up a can of worms."""
Monica, Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here  like today. I mean  I think you should do it.
Ross, It’s sex.
Monica, Do it!
Ross, Monica!
Monica, I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean  women have needs. Do it  get yours!
Phoebe, Oh I-I don’t know about that. No  I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
Monica, All right  let’s be practical  if Ross isn’t willing to do it  he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!
Ross, Monica  what is the matter with you?
Monica, Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Rachel, Why? Why today?
Monica, Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!
Ross, What?! While she’s been going through this hell  you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! 
Rachel, I’ll take that bet.
Ross, What?!
Rachel, Well  I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Ross, Can I get some of that action?
Monica, Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?
Rachel, Oh honey  don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
Monica, Oh  okay!
Joey, Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Chandler, Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Joey,  Oh no  were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Chandler, I’m so sorry.
Joey, Uh-huh look  the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career  I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay  so how much do I owe you?
Chandler, What?!
Joey, Give me a number  I don’t want to owe you anything!
Chandler, You don’t owe me anything  I don’t want you money…
Joey, Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay  now you got me my first set of head shots. Right  how much were those?
Chandler, I don’t know  five hundred dollars?
Joey, Okay  five hundred dollars. What else?
Chandler, Well then there was the second set  the infamous booger head shots.
Joey, Okay  so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred  that’s… 
Chandler, Do you want a calculator?
Joey, Please!
Chandler, Here! 
Joey, All right  what else?
Chandler, Well uh  there was acting classes  stage combat classes  tap classes…
Joey, Which we’re still keeping under our hats!
Chandler, Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Joey," What the hell are you talking about   ""The south will rise again man."""
Chandler, Yes  money well spent!
Joey, Yeah. Okay  what else? Rent!
Chandler, Okay  two  three years of rent  utilities  food…
Joey, Okay. Okay  so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
Ross, Come on  finish your enchilada.
Rachel, Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
Ross, Okay here  have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!  Oh my— By the way  you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.
Rachel, I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot  watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Ross, Stop it.
Rachel, Oh come on Ross  why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
Ross, I’m sorry  but we have to have some boundaries! My God  I’m dying.
Rachel, Oh come on Ross  we’ve done it before we’ll do it again  it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
Ross, This is insane  I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.
Rachel, Make love? What are you a girl?
Ross, Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.
Rachel, But you will  you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle  y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Ross, I love when you talk dirty to me.
Rachel, Oh  I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!  Whoops! Oh  I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it.  Oh God!
Ross, Okay enough! This is  this is not going to happen.
Rachel, Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this  now you finish it! Come on wuss  make love to me.
Ross, Y’know what?
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Forget it.
Rachel, Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute  I know.  I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses  but no!! That’s not enough…  What are you doing?!
Ross, I’m getting that baby out of you!
Rachel,  Oh God!
Ross, Oh  I know.
Rachel, Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Ross, I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh  I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Rachel, Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, We’re having a baby.
Rachel, I didn’t uh  really have time to read this part of the books  but do you think we have time to…
Ross, Not so much.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Two hundred.
Phoebe, Thank you!
Monica, That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes  no more betting.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Hello?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  I guess we can bet one more time.
Phoebe, Is Rachel having the baby?
Monica, How did you know that?!  Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!
Phoebe, They’re at the coffeehouse.
Monica, You know everything!! Oh wait  double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds.  I bet you it has hair.  I bet you it’s a girl.
Phoebe, We know it’s a girl! 
Monica,  I’ll give you really good odds.
Ross, All right!  Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
Rachel,  Yes  the hard part is truly over.
Ross, No  but come on  we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast  but this has got to be some kind of a record!
Phoebe, Oh you made it!
Rachel, Hi! 
Monica, How are you doing?
Ross, Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Monica, We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Ross, N… No! We took a cab too  but I did test runs!
Chandler, Hi!
Joey, Hey! You made it!
Ross, Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
Rachel, Ross  you stay here and talk  I’m gonna go have a baby.
Ross, Okay. Okay.  Umm hi  this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
Rachel,  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry  semi-private? We   we asked for a private room.
Chandler, Man  if only you’d gotten here sooner. 
Rachel, Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! 
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, Give her some money.
Ross, I really think they’re out of rooms.
Rachel, They’re not!! Ross  they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Ross, Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble  you don’t know where any countries are.  Okay.  Uh  say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm  private rooms may have  opened up?
Rachel,  Okay. Y’know what? I’d have to say I really don’t care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to—Whoa!  Oh gosh! Whoa!
Ross, What-what?
Rachel, Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow! 
Rachel, Yeah  it couldn’t hurt to look.
Rachel, Oh  okay.
Ross, Thank you.
Rachel, Thank you.  Well  I guess we have some time to kill.
Ross, Yeah  guess so. Whew! Check these out!  Never done this before.
Rachel, Yeah well it looks great!
Ross, Hi! Hi  I’m uh Ross. I’m here to ruin this magical day for you.
Ross, Hi Julie.
Ross, This is Rachel. 
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, How are you?
Rachel, Yeah it is.
Rachel, That’s so sweet.
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Umm say  I-I opened this earlier  but let me give you guys some privacy.
Ross, Oh  okay.
Rachel, Oh no  I really don’t want any——Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross…
Ross, What?
Rachel, Here comes another contraction.
Ross, Oh. Okay  just breathe.
Phoebe,  Oh wow  three hours and still no baby. Ugh  the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Monica, Hey  you wanna see something?
Phoebe, Sure! What?
Monica, Umm  this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Chandler, Yeah?
Monica, Listen uh  I-I’ve been doing some thinking  and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm  I think we should try to have a baby.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  What-what-what’s that now?!
Chandler, Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too  and I  I think we’re ready.
Monica, What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!
Phoebe, Oh  this is fun.
Joey, You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!
Chandler, But you said you were ready too.
Monica, Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Chandler, Yes  but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?
Monica, Okay  just back off mister! Whoa.  ‘Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
Joey,  What?! Are you crazy?!
Monica, That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
Rachel, Oh  that’s very—Really very-very okay.
Rachel,  No  I don’t think we’ll be doing that.
Ross,  We’re not gonna do that.
Ross, Uh yes! Thank you.
Rachel, Oh. Oh wait no.
Ross, Later.
Rachel, No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.
Ross, Oh uh  I’m sorry. 
Rachel, No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Ross, Hi! I’m so glad you’re here  but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.
Ross, Oh good.
Ross, Okay  what’s up?
Ross, Ma  you’re asking me to marry you?
Ross, Mom no  come on! Thank you.
Ross, N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant  okay?
Ross, Mom  y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…
Ross, Gimmie! 
Rachel, Hi!
Rachel, Oh  thank you so much for coming. Ross  get in here!
Ross, …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.
Phoebe, Yeah.  Why aren’t you with Rachel?
Ross, Are you kidding? Look  we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?
Phoebe, But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Ross, Okay  stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
Phoebe, Right. And with who again? 
Joey, God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?
Phoebe, I know!
Joey, I mean seriously  she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down  but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me  I would take her in my arms and…  I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Ross,  Hey. Who’s that?
Rachel, New people.
Ross, What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Rachel, They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Ross, Wow! Sorry. So uh  how are the new people?
Rachel, Well they have uh  some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm  evil bitch and uh  sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Ross, Yeah? Okay.
Rachel, Ooh! Ow!!
Ross, Umm. Umm  I’m-I’m just gonna—
Ross, No-no  I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. 
Ross, Just ignore them.
Rachel, Ross.
Ross, What? What?
Rachel, He’s looking at me.
Ross,  Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Monica, Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
Monica, What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Chandler, I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
Monica, What?
Chandler, Look  we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now  but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
Monica, We are pretty good.
Chandler, But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Monica, Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean  it’s a little scary  but maybe it’s right.
Chandler, What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
Monica, What?!!
Chandler, I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
Monica, So we’re gonna try? I mean  are we trying?
Chandler, We’re trying to get pregnant.  Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So  when do you want to start trying?
Monica, Okay  hold on a sec.
Chandler, Period math?
Monica, Yeah.
Chandler, Yeah.
Monica, Well  we could start trying. Now.
Chandler, Right here?
Monica, No  not here. Maybe here.
Chandler, Wait a minute  it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
Monica, And it’s so clean!!
Joey, Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Phoebe, Oh  it ate your money?
Joey,  No.
Phoebe, All right  I’ll see you downstairs then.
Joey, All right.
Phoebe, All right.
Joey, Hey I got one! I got one!
Phoebe, Hi.
Phoebe, Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? 
Phoebe, Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Phoebe, Well  it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.  How about you?
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Uh-huh  yeah.
Phoebe, Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Phoebe, Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Joey,  Uh  you gotta press the button. 
Ross, The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.
Rachel, Ugh  is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross  another contraction! 
Ross, That’s it. That’s it.
Rachel, Yeah it was.
Phoebe,  Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm  he’s like early to mid-thirties  very attractive.
Phoebe, Oh yay! Great! Okay  what room number is he in?
Joey,  Uh  she’s with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
Joey, Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.
Joey, Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
Phoebe, Hands.
Joey, Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine  I’ve been treating him for years!
Joey, 816  thank you!
Phoebe, Thank you. 
Joey, And what is his name?
Phoebe,  No! 
Monica, I think we found a place.
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, Umm  wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Chandler, Okay. Uh  we’ll dim the lights  dim the lights.  Or turn them out all together. Uh  no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. 
Monica, Okay! Okay! Make me sterile  but okay.
Monica, Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom?  Oh right! 
Chandler, Yes  98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
Phoebe, Ooh  this is it!  Oh  that’s him! That’s him!
Joey, Great! Go get him.
Phoebe, Wait a second  or maybe you can go in first.
Joey,  He’s not really my type.
Phoebe, No not you  Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.
Joey, But you said he was this great guy!
Phoebe, But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first  then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
Joey, You do attract some stinkers.
Rachel, Dr. Long  I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies  you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
Ross, Just three?! I’m dilated three!
Rachel, Hey  y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! 
Ross, Actually it’s more like this. 
Rachel, Oh stupid metric system!
Rachel, Oh for the love of God!
Rachel, Oh come on!!
Joey, Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Joey, I know  but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side  Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Joey, That was a test. Good response. All right  full name.
Joey, Date of birth?
Joey, Age?
Joey, I’m a doctor Cliff  not a mathematician.
Joey, Okay. And uh  are you married.
Joey, Oh really? So  33 and still single  would you say you have commitment issues?
Joey,  Yes.
Joey, Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.
Joey, Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Joey, Excellent! Excellent! And uh  finally  are you into any weird stuff y’know  sexually?
Joey, Oooh  wrong answer. 
Rachel, Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women  that’s four  one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated  have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital  I’m going to sue you! And my husband  he’s a lawyer!
Ross, Uh Rach…
Rachel, Go get back on that case honey!
Rachel, Okay  well then bring her in.
Ross, And yet somehow it’s true!
Ross,  Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
Ross,  Really?
Rachel, Oh!
Ross, Oh there you go!
Rachel, I get it!
Rachel, Oh we-we didn’t.
Ross, No-no. We…
Ross, Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh  uh that’s all.
Ross, Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place  y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
Rachel, Just tell me how.
Ross, Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Phoebe, What else? What else?
Joey, Uh  well he’s 33.
Phoebe, Oh. Ah-uh.
Joey, A widower.
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh  and he’s not into anything weird sexually.
Phoebe, Enter Pheebs.
Chandler, Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
Monica, We could  or we can have sex in it.
Chandler, Well let me think about that  while I remove my pants!
Monica,  Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica, Does that sound like Janice?
Chandler, If it’s not  then there’s two of them. And that would mean it’s the end of the world!
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hi.
Rachel, Oh hi.
Monica, I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Rachel, Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Chandler, Weirdest thing. Did I hear——Mother of God it’s true!
Chandler, Jan-Janice!
Ross, Not just Janice  Janice in labor  contracting and everything.
Chandler, Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
Chandler, What?!
Chandler, That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Phoebe, Okay I’ve got one for you  if you had too which one would you rather eat  a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
Phoebe, Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? I’m sorry. 
Phoebe, Oh  I’ll get it. 
Phoebe, Relax  it’s not like we’re forking.
Rachel, Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?
Ross, Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
Rachel, Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! 
Rachel, Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Phoebe, Y’know what? This one is. 
Phoebe, Huh. Okay  Mr. Perkazet.
Phoebe, Cliff  do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Joey,  Rachel’s having her baby!!  Which is of no interest to me  I’m a neurologist.
Phoebe, Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know  if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
Joey, Fake? Excuse me? Hello? 
Phoebe, You’re right  that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just  can we just start over?
Joey, Uh  if I may? Umm-umm look  Cliff  you told me a lot of personal stuff about you  right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh  she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh  she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Phoebe, Uh Joey  we’re trying to dial down the crazy.
Joey, Right!
Phoebe, Umm  look we don’t  we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this  but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.
Joey, Me neither.
Rachel, 3-2-1 oh!!
Rachel, I can’t. I can’t push anymore  I can’t.
Ross, Sweetie you’re doing great.
Rachel, Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Ross, What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
Rachel," Don’t say  ""Oh my God!"" Oh my God what?"
Ross, What is that?
Ross, Oh thank God  I thought she had two heads.
Rachel, Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Ross, Go!
Rachel, I’m sorry  I can’t!
Ross, Yes you can!
Rachel, I can’t!
Ross, Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
Rachel, I can’t. Please  you do it for me.
Ross, No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! 
Ross,  Keep pushing!
Rachel, Are you okay?
Ross, You have no idea how much this hurts.  Keep going! Keep going!
Ross, Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
Rachel, Oh God!
Ross, Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
Ross, Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
Rachel, Oh  she’s so tiny.  Where’d she go?
Ross, Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
Rachel, Okay. Well be careful with her  she’s really tiny.
Rachel, Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me.  I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh  she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Rachel, No  not yet.
Rachel, Oh no  Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Rachel, Hello baby girl.
Phoebe, Can we come in?
Ross, Oh  come in.
Phoebe, Hi!
Joey, There she is!
Phoebe, Oh  she’s so beautiful.
Rachel, Here. 
Monica, Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh  oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
Chandler, It’s incredible  I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
Joey,  She looks so real!  Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
Rachel, What?
Joey, Oh no-no  no for I second there I counted six fingers  but one was from the other hand so we’re good.
Phoebe, Okay  my turn. My turn.  Oh! You’re so cute! Oh  I could squeeze your little head!  I won’t.
Monica, What’s the matter?
Rachel, Oh nothing I… Sorry  I just can’t stop crying.
Ross, The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus  you-you’re sleep deprived.
Rachel, So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. 
Joey, What’s the matter now?
Rachel, I was reliving it.
Phoebe, Ohhh. 
Chandler, So  do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
Phoebe, Oh  wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
Ross, Uh actually  we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
Rachel, Yeah  and y’know what? I love them both  so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.
Ross, Wow! Umm  okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella.  What?
Rachel, That’s not her name! I’m sorry  she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.
Chandler, So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Joey, What was the other one Ross?
Ross, Umm  Delilah.
Rachel, Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Ross, So I guess we’re back to uh  Baby Girl.
Phoebe, Yay!
Rachel, Well what are we going to do?
Monica, It’s okay honey  you’ll find a name.
Ross, Ugh  easy for you to say  you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Chandler, You do?
Monica, Yeah  I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Chandler, Oh no  it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?
Rachel, Well tell us! What are they?
Monica, Umm  okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.
Rachel, And if it’s a girl?
Monica, I don’t want to say.
Rachel, Oh  just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!
Monica, Okay. It’s Emma.
Rachel,  Emma!  See? I don’t want it.
Monica, Take it.
Rachel, What?
Monica, It’s clearly an Emma.
Rachel, Oh honey  but you love that name.
Monica, Yeah  but I love you more. Besides y’know  nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean…  Oh  hi Emma. Yeah  that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh  you want a little cousin?  You want a cousin right now?!
Chandler, That was amazing.
Monica, I know. Hey  do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here  having our own baby.
Chandler, And if not  we got to do it on a bucket.
Rachel, Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
Rachel, Oh  I’m fine. 
Rachel, Oh  I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Rachel, Well then he gets a divorce  it’s Ross!
Rachel, Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
Rachel, Really?
Rachel, Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone  ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross  y’know? Right before I went into labor  we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
Ross,  Hey Janice!
Ross, Who’s this little guy? 
Ross, No-no. No.
Ross, Okay.
Ross, Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Rachel, Uh-huh.  Y’know what I was  I was thinking about?
Ross, Huh?
Rachel, Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
Ross, Yeah. Yeah  it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again  y’know?
Rachel,  Right.
Ross, I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
Rachel, No! No  of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up.  They didn’t have any sodas?
Ross, Oh my God! I’m sorry  I was talking to this nurse  completely forgot.
Rachel, That’s all right.  And so it begins.
Phoebe, Is she in there?
Ross, Yeah. She’s putting her down now  that’s her. 
Phoebe, Oh!
Ross, Look at Emma!
Phoebe, I just can’t decide who she looks more alike  you or Rachel?
Ross, Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous  it’s all Rachel.
Phoebe, I’m sorry  for the last time  why aren’t you two together again?  No  I know. I know  because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine  except you totally are.
Ross, It’s…it’s complicated okay?
Phoebe, Yeah that’s true. Yeah  you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
Ross, Look  we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart  and then together  and then apart  and now we have a baby.  It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything— Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really  we’re doing really well right now.
Phoebe, I know. I know. I know. I know  and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Ross, Yeah  exactly.
Phoebe, Right.  Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.
Joey, Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What’s the matter?
Rachel, Nothing.
Joey, What is it? Hey!
Rachel, Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
Joey, Rach come on  what?
Rachel, I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
Joey, What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Rachel, Oh please  he’ll be with his real family  the twins and little miss new boobs.
Joey, Okay  how long was I watching that woman?
Rachel, I’m just saying that y’know  someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
Joey, Yeah  I guess so.
Rachel, I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Joey, Hey  listen to me  listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.
Rachel, Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
Joey, You don’t have to worry about that okay?
Rachel, Oh  hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
Joey, Sure.
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, My God.
Rachel, Joey.
Rachel,  Oh my God.  Okay.
Rachel, Joey.
Rachel,  Oh my God.  Okay.
Rachel, So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?
Joey, Uh… Look Rach… Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Ross, Hey Joey.  Hey you.
Rachel, Hey you.
Joey, Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross  but I’m really more of a candy guy. 
Ross, You’re weird today.   Listen I uh  wanted to talk to you about something.
Rachel, Uh yeah  actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Ross, Uh Joey  can you give us just a minute?
Joey, No.
Ross, What?
Joey, Oh  I’m sorry. I meant no.
Monica,  Hi! Hey look who’s here!
Chandler, He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Ross, Hey  where’s uh  where’s mom?
Monica, Oh  Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Chandler, Okay. Wow.
Ross, Uh Dad  Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want  but  I really want to talk to you.
Rachel, I know  I still need to talk to you.
Joey, Oh hey but  before you guys do that  I need to talk to you  and Ross  I need to talk to you.
Phoebe,  Oh and I need to talk to you.
Monica, About what?
Phoebe, To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Monica, Isn’t she beautiful?
Ross, What about Ben?
Phoebe,  Have umm  have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
Ross, Oh well yeah  actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Phoebe, Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow  you could’ve done that with us there.
Ross, Yeah right.
Phoebe, Oh sure okay  you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.
Ross, What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Phoebe, Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh  that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
Joey,  Hey Chandler  can I talk to you for a second?
Chandler, Sure.
Joey, Dude I just did something terrible.
Chandler, That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Joey, No! No  that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Chandler, What?! Why does she think that?
Joey, Because it kinda looked like I did.
Chandler, Again  what?!
Joey, Okay well  I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…
Chandler, As we all are at some point during the day.
Joey, It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Chandler, Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Joey, I guess.
Chandler, And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
Joey, I know! I know it’s awful.
Chandler, Well  what did she say?
Joey,  She said yes.
Chandler, Does Ross know?
Joey, Oh God  what the hell am I going to tell him?
Chandler, Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
Joey, Oh  I like that. Yeah…
Chandler, If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out  but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
Joey,  Now let’s not get carried away. 
Monica, I want a baby.
Chandler, Honey  we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Monica, Come on! Come on  if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?
Chandler, I’m so tired.  Yeah okay  but no foreplay.
Monica, Deal!
Ross, Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!
Ross, I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute  are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Ross,  Actually umm… 
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hi.
Phoebe, Are you all right?
Rachel, Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
Phoebe, Oh my God! He did it?
Rachel, Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
Phoebe, Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Rachel, And you really think this is a good idea?
Phoebe, I just talked him into it  don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.
Rachel, I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
Phoebe, Why?! You two are so meant to be together  everybody thinks so.
Rachel, Really?! Even Ross?
Phoebe, Especially Ross!
Joey,  Oh uh  hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later. 
Ross, Wow! Kind of uh  kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. 
Phoebe, There he goes  your fianc�e.
Rachel, I guess so.
Phoebe, Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Rachel, I can’t say that I’m surprised.
Ross, Dad  what are you doing?
Joey, It can’t be me  I’m standing right here.
Ross, No!
Ross, Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.  Come on. 
Joey,  We’re not peeking? 
Chandler, Hello sir  you know Monica.
Joey, Hey uh  is it okay to come in?
Rachel, Of course! Oh Joey  this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
Joey, Yeah uh look Rach  there’s something I gotta tell ya.
Rachel, Hey!
Rachel, Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey  why do you think she won’t take my breast?
Joey,  Yowsa! 
Rachel, Okay sweetie  you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Joey, Dear Lord.
Rachel, I’m sorry honey  what were you saying?
Joey, Oh uh-uh yeah  I think that…
Rachel, Oh look  she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?
Joey, Y’know  I don’t really know her.
Joey,  Are you kidding me?!
Rachel, It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
Joey, I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! 
Phoebe, Oh hey! Wait up!
Ross, Hi!
Phoebe, Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.
Ross, What  that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit  although  he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Phoebe, No! No  that you and Rachel are engaged!
Ross, What?
Phoebe, Oh  it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.
Ross, Phoebe  there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
Phoebe, Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?
Ross,  I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Phoebe, All right  me too.  Should we wake her up?
Ross, No! No  come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
Phoebe, And so engaged. 
Ross, What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
Phoebe, Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.
Ross, I didn’t give her that ring!
Phoebe, Really?
Ross, No!
Phoebe, So whose ring is it?
Ross, It’s mine.
Phoebe, Is it an engagement ring?
Ross, Yes!
Phoebe, But you didn’t give it to her?
Ross, No!
Phoebe, But you were going to propose?
Ross, No!!
Phoebe, Huh  I might be losing interest in this.
Ross, Look. Look  my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel  but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
Phoebe, Oh  what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Ross, Look  I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t  I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket  assume that I was going to propose  throw it on  and-and just start telling people?
Phoebe, No! No  she said you actually proposed to her.
Ross, Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Unless uh…  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
Chandler, Look  we can’t stay in here forever.
Monica, Oh  I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals  but this he sees!
Chandler, This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now  let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. 
Monica, Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Chandler, I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there  that wasn’t for fun.
Monica, It wasn’t fun?!
Chandler,  Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…  Look  I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.
Monica, The truth is  Dad  we’re-we’re trying.
Monica, Yeah  we’re trying to get pregnant.
Monica, Well  that’s okay dad  we-we can wait until later.
Monica, Daddy?!
Chandler, That’s funny  this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Monica, Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Monica, I don’t feel good right now.
Chandler, Seriously sir  my brains? All over the wall.
Monica, Hey.
Rachel, Hey. I need to tell you something.
Monica, Well  now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.
Rachel, Joey asked me marry him.
Monica, What?
Rachel, Joey proposed to me.
Monica, Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
Rachel, Well  I-I said yes.
Monica, What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No  it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine! 
Rachel, I know. Days of Our Lives  thank you very much.
Monica, You can’t marry him!
Rachel, Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
Monica, Well do you love him?
Rachel, Sure.
Monica, Sure?
Rachel, Yeah  I mean whatever.
Monica, Honey  the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
Rachel, No. No  I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Chandler, You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?
Joey, No! She had the ring on  she seemed so excited  and then she took her breast out.
Chandler, Joey  you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!
Joey, I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
Chandler, Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Joey, Look  it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.
Chandler, Okay  look  just do it gently.
Joey, You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh  by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Listen  I um… I heard about the engagement.
Rachel, Surprised?
Ross, And confused. Rach  sweetie  I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.
Rachel, I know.
Ross, I don’t think you do.
Rachel, You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
Ross, Poor baby  you’re so tired. Rach  I didn’t propose to you  Joey didn’t propose to you  and Chandler didn’t propose to you.
Rachel, Uh… You didn’t propose to me  Chandler didn’t propose to me  but Joey did.
Ross, Joey proposed to you?
Joey, I can come back.
Ross, Hey  wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey  did you propose to her?
Joey, No.
Rachel, Yes you did!
Joey, Actually  technically  I didn’t.
Rachel, Well then why did you give me a ring?
Ross, Wait! Whoa-whoa  you…you gave her the ring?
Joey, No! No  and I did not ask her to marry me!
Rachel, Yes  you did!
Joey, No  I didn’t!
Rachel, Yes  you did!
Joey, No  I didn’t!
Rachel," Yes  you did! And don’t you say  ""No  I didn’t!"""
Joey, Ahhh!
Rachel, He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ross, Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Joey, Yeah. Yeah  that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!
Ross, Then what did happen?
Rachel, Yeah  what did happen?
Joey, Okay  the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
Rachel," Yeah  but you said  ""Will you marry me?"""
Joey, No  I didn’t!
Rachel, Yes  you did!
Joey, No  I didn’t!
Rachel, Yes  you did—Oh my God you didn’t!  Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!
Joey, Well I tried  but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
Ross, Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa  you saw her breast?!
Joey,  I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Rachel, Well then Joey  what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
Joey, It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach  because he was going to propose.
Ross, What?!
Rachel, You were gonna propose to me?
Ross, Uhh… No.
Joey, Well  this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Ross, But I-I was going to see if y’know  maybe you uh  start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all  Rach.
Joey, Dude  step up! I proposed.
Ross, No  you didn’t!
Joey, Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross,  I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!
Joey, I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!
Ross, Hey  I’m not going to rush into anything!
Joey, Oh yeah  dude  I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Rachel, Oh my God!
Ross, What?
Rachel, She’s doing it Look  she’s breast-feeding look!
Joey,  Ah  it’s beautiful.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Thank you. 
Rachel, Oh wow  this feels weird.
Ross, Good weird?
Rachel, Wonderful weird.
Joey, Y’know what you guys? I’m uh  I’m gonna go too. And uh  I’m sorry about everything.
Rachel, Honey don’t worry  it was my mistake.
Joey, No  Rach  I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man! That kid is going to town! 
Rachel, She’s perfect.
Ross, We’re so lucky.
Rachel, We really are.
Ross, Look  I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are  but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…
Rachel, I know. I know. I’ve feeling…
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, Yeah. 
Ross, Okay  well  that… Wow  okay  well  umm…then maybe  at least we can  we can talk about us again.
Rachel, Yeah  maybe.
Ross, Well good  okay. I-I  kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.
Rachel, Wh-what’s that?
Ross, And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Rachel, I’m sorry  what?
Ross, When you thought Joey proposed did…did you say yes?
Monica,  Hey dad!
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, You said you’d marry Joey?
Rachel, Okay you have to realize  I was exhausted  I was emotional  I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I’m not helping.
Ross, So you said yes to him  and you just had our baby?
Rachel, That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Ross, So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again  you were engaged to my best friend.
Rachel, Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Ross, Well  Chandler’s my oldest friend  but Joey’s my—No! Ah! 
Rachel, Ooooo!
Joey,  Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know  say goodbye.
Ross, Rachel said she’d marry you?!
Joey,  This isn’t the right room  sorry folks. 
Monica, Ok  I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Phoebe," No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one   See?"
Monica,  So sexy.  Honey.
Chandler, Yea yea. 
Monica, Honey why don’t you go lie down.
Chandler, No  no  Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
Joey, Why’re you so tired?
Chandler, Couldn’t sleep last night you know  then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today  the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like  if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep  but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
Joey, You know what you should’ve done  you should have told yourself that little story.
Rachel,  Hi!
Monica, Phoebe did the signs!
Rachel, Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe, Look at all the stuff people sent!
Rachel, Oh Ah!  Oh my gosh there’s something every mother needs  a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think…  Oh you guys I love it.
Joey, Hey so where’s Ross?
Rachel, He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Joey, Is he still mad at us?
Rachel, Well  you more then me  but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean  I just had his baby.
Joey, That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
Rachel, Yeah  I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Joey, See this is what I was afraid of  I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now.
Chandler, Hey  what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Chandler, Walter .
Phoebe, She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Monica, Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Ross,  Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Rachel, Oh great  the pacifiers?
Ross, In the closet.
Rachel, The burping clogs?
Ross, Linen closet.
Rachel, The diapers?
Ross, In the hospital.
Phoebe, Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!
Ross, No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
Rachel, Alright thanks  oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Ross, Sure what kind?
Rachel, Umm let me think...What do I want  what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Ross, Please take your time  it’s an important decision. Not like  say  I know! deciding to marry someone  this is about a muffin.
Rachel, Blueberry.
Ross, Blueberry it is.
Rachel, Thanks.
Monica, Wow  he’s really not letting this go  is he?
Rachel, God how long do you think that’s gonna last?
Phoebe," I dunno  well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly."
Rachel, Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now  cause I got the cutie little baby  oh I can’t believe how much I love her  I can’t get enough of her  like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
Phoebe, You know that’s… that’s her.
Rachel, Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh  I love her so much!  Oh  I think I’m gonna wake her up.
Phoebe, Oh no  Rach  no no  you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Rachel, Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her!  Come on little girl  hi!
Phoebe, I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.
Rachel, Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
Monica, Breaks your heart doesn’t it
Phoebe, It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
Chandler, Yep.
Chandler,  Yes.
Phoebe, Well  alright  we already tried feeding her  changing her  burping her  oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Monica, Alright here’s something  it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Rachel, Ok. 
Monica, It worked!
Rachel, Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.  Oh come on  what am I gonna do  its been hours and it won’t stop crying.
Monica, Umm  she Rach  not it  she.
Rachel, Yeah  I’m not so sure.
Monica, Oh my god  I am losing my mind.
Phoebe, Yeah  no kidding  this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Ross, Hey Gunther  can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? 
Ross, Yep.
Ross, Yep  can you believe it?
Ross, Huh? Ooh  you mean like a… Huh?
Joey,  Hey.  Ross  I know you’re pissed at me  but we have to talk about this.
Ross, Ah actually we don’t. 
Joey,  Fine  fine okay.  But I gotta say technically  I didn’t even do anything wrong.
Ross,  What!  You didn’t do anything wrong?!
Joey, I said I didn’t technically.
Ross," Okay let’s put aside that you  ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
Joey, Look  can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I don’t really know what that means.  You were saying?
Ross, And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel  but why couldn’t you tell me  huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.
Joey," I know I should’ve.  ""I’m sorry."""
Ross, Not using it right  Joe.
Ross, I’m gonna go.
Joey, No  come on Ross!  Look  Ross  we have to get past this.
Ross, Give me the bag.
Joey, No  look  I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!
Ross, Joey!
Joey, You should scream at me  or-or-or curse me  or hit me.
Ross, I’m not gonna hit you.
Joey, Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better  and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Ross, No I don’t.
Joey, A little bit.
Ross, No.
Joey, Little bit.
Ross, No!
Joey,  A little bit more.
Ross, Give me the bag.
Joey, No  hit me
Ross, Give me the bag.
Joey, Hit me.
Ross, Joey  give me the bag.
Joey, Hit me!
Ross, Joe I’m not kidding…
Joey,  Hit me  hit me.
Ross, No!
Joey,  Hit me! Hit me!
Ross, You ducked!!
Joey, I’m sorry! It was a reflex!
Ross, Oh my god  this really hurts!!!
Joey, I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face  you duck! Look! 
Ross, What is the matter with you?!?
Joey, You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
Ross, Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Joey," Good  good yeah   maybe while we’re there  they can check your reflexes.   ""Oops."""
Monica, Try feeding her again.
Rachel, I already fed her.
Monica, I know  that’s why I said again!
Phoebe, Alright you guys  we can’t turn on each other  Okay?  That’s just what she wants.
Chandler,  Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Rachel, Oh no  you guys  just stay here  I’m gonna go check her diaper  Pheebs you wanna come?
Phoebe, Oh I’m kinda part of this.
Chandler, Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Phoebe, I knew I should have married Chandler.
Monica, Okay what’s up
Chandler, Umm  you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know  you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Monica, Oh yeah .
Chandler, Okay  you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Monica, What? Who says that?
Chandler, People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
Monica, What’s going on?
Chandler, We’re moving to Tulsa! 
Monica, Excuse me?
Chandler, Okay  Ms. McKenna  she kind of works above my boss  she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there  and I was sleeping and apparently  said yes.
Monica,  Tulsa  Oklahoma!
Chandler, The Sooner State  whatever that is.
Monica, Chandler  I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Chandler, Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Monica, Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma  or that you’re gay? All right  not that this matters  but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Chandler, No  no  but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.
Monica, Thank you.
Chandler,  What is wrong with Emma?
Monica, Oh she misunderstood  she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Chandler, Umm ma’am  do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
Chandler, It’s a funny story  actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa  I didn’t really know what I was saying.
Chandler, But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting  ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan  alright . See  here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See  me  I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!
Chandler, No no no! Look  Carol  can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son  strapping!  That’s a picture of your daughter  isn’t it  well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. 
Joey, Hey  so how is it?
Ross, I broke my thumb.
Joey, Your thumb? That’s weird.  You sure you’re punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Ross, You know what  you can go  I just have to fill out some forms. 
Joey, You  you want me to help you with that?
Ross, Why  does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? 
Joey, Name?  I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like  like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Ross, Just Ross!
Joey, It’s pretty  Okay date of birth?
Ross, You know my birthday.
Joey, Sure  May...tember.
Ross, October 18th.
Joey, Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Ross, Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
Joey, Alright  who do you want as your emergency contact?
Ross, Ah  Rachel I guess.
Joey, Okay  relationship  boy this could take a while.
Ross, Just ah… just put roommate.
Joey, Come on  you guys are more then that! I mean  you’re gonna get together right?
Ross, I don’t think that we are.
Joey, But you two were supposed to be together.
Ross, Well  I thought so too  but then she said she’d marry you.
Joey, Come on  Ross  that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby  she was all freaked out about doing it alone  she would have said yes to anybody.
Ross, Yeah that’s what she said.
Joey, So?
Ross, So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
Joey, Wow.
Ross, You know what  it’s  it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking  going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
Joey, Really?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, And you’re Okay with that?
Ross, Yes. I mean  it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan  you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?  I’m fine.
Joey," Hey  for what it’s worth  with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just  ""anybody."""
Ross, Hey there you go! 
Joey,"  ""Thanks."""
Rachel, Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Monica, About a week and a half.
Phoebe, Well alright  looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go.  No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! 
Monica, Rach  try holding her a different way.
Rachel, You guys  I’m doing the best I can  anyone else is welcome to try.
Phoebe, Alright  I’ll try  fine! Yes  Okay!
Rachel, Here you go. 
Phoebe, Shh! Nothing works with this child! 
Rachel, Oh god what am I gonna do you guys  I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!
Monica, You’re just new at this  it’ll get better  think about your first day at work. I mean  that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.
Rachel, Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Monica, Okay I’ll take her  here. 
Rachel, I have to go to the bathroom. 
Phoebe, I have to go scream into a pillow. 
Monica,  Bouncy baby  Bouncy baby  Ooh baby baby  Ooh baby baby  Ooh baby baby. 
Phoebe,  Have I gone deaf?
Monica, It worked! Ooh baby baby baby  ooh baby baby baby!
Phoebe, You must be a fireball in bed.
Monica, I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
Phoebe, I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again!  I’m kidding. 
Rachel, Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Monica, Yes I did  I’m Monica  Super Aunt
Rachel, You are the official baby crier stopper!
Monica, Yes I am!!
Rachel, You’re never leaving the apartment!
Monica, Say what?
Rachel, That’s your new job  day and night  she starts crying I need you here.
Monica,  Oh no no no no!
Phoebe, Thankfully you don’t need me at all  so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months .
Rachel, Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.
Monica, What?
Rachel, You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… 
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Chandler, Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
Monica, No.
Chandler, We’re moving to Tulsa
Monica,  What!?
Chandler, Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  I can’t  I can’t hear you. 
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Heeeeey  where have you been?  What happened to you?
Ross, Ah I had a little thing with Joey  if you think this is bad you should see him.
Rachel, Oh no Ross! This is not good  we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing  okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey  okay?
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, You know what I really really want?
Ross, What  Rach?
Rachel, I wanna sleep  I wanna eat  I wanna take a shower  I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Ross,  Right.
Rachel, I mean I got news for you mister  Emma?  Not easy.
Ross, Well  that’s what I’m here for.  Want me to get that?
Rachel, No its really okay… Monica!
Monica,  Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
Joey, You know  ah  I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya  it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct.
Chandler,  Hey  what you guys talking about?
Joey, Hey OK great  what would you do if I did this? 
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Chandler, Okay  our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa   so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
Ross, Oh my God!
Phoebe, What?!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Monday?!
Joey, How long do you have to go for?
Chandler, They said it could be up to a year.
Joey, A year?!
Rachel,  Do you have to go?
Monica, I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing 
Chandler, There is nothing like the support of your loving wife  huh?
Joey, Wait a minute  you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot  but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Chandler, I'm sorry buddy  but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
Joey, We were gonna go see the Jets!
Ross, You can't go  I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
Chandler, Really?
Ross, Not you.
Joey, I can't believe you guys are moving.
Phoebe, I call their apartment!!!
Joey, Here you are 
Rachel, Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Ross, I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Rachel, Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Joey, 
Rachel, Every time? 
Joey, Uhuh.
Ross, Rach  you don't have to call whenever you have a little question  okay? Trust me  I know this.
Rachel, All right  I trust you. 
Ross, Rachel  I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
Rachel, I'm on the phone!  Dr. Wiener? 
Joey, 
Phoebe, It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Joey, I know  yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener  God that kills me. 
Phoebe, Look at you all grown up.
Joey, Actually  you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah  she's gotta be hot.
Phoebe, You know  I might know somebody. Hey  how about you set me up with someone  and we double date!
Joey, I can do that  yeah. How is Friday?
Phoebe, Done. Oh good  really?
Joey, Yeah!
Phoebe, Let's see!  Oh  you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Joey,  Poophack... 
Phoebe, Yeah... All right  well that rules out Lana Titweiller
Joey, 
Chandler,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, I've got good news!
Monica, You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Chandler, Okay  I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
Monica, It's great! How?
Monica, So you're gonna be gone four days a week?  No.
Chandler, I'm sorry  are you just used to saying that?
Monica, No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, Yeah  you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Chandler, That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
Monica, Honey  thanks for trying to figure out a way  but if you're going to Tulsa  I wanna go with you.
Chandler, Hey  you said that without gagging!
Monica, I know! 
Rachel,  Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well  up yours too! 
Ross, Who the hell was that?!
Rachel, Dr. Wiener.
Ross, Rach  you can't call people at three in the morning.
Rachel, Oh you know what  you sound just like his wife!
Ross, Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Rachel, Yes  of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
Ross, Well  what was it?
Rachel, Hiccups.
Ross, Rach  I told you  you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Rachel, Yeah well  not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait  Monica said that when you guys were growing up  you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
Ross, Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know  I don't think that's a good idea. In fact  I think he's dead.
Rachel, Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
Ross, Rach  I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor  but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Rachel, What? What  do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma  she has not had that shot.
Ross, You know? Come to think of it  it does feel Rubella-like! 
Rachel,    Wiener  Wiener  Wiener  Wiener!!!
Ross,  Rachel!!!
Rachel, Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
Phoebe,  Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, So how is this for our big double date tonight? 
Joey,  Oh my God!
Phoebe, Ooh  great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Joey, Yeah  so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
Phoebe, Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny  and I can't tell you how I know this  but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Come on  give me something. What's his name?
Joey, Mike.
Phoebe, Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
Joey, Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Phoebe, All right  we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
Joey, Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in there!
Rachel, It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean  how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
Monica, Excuse me?
Chandler, I know what she's talking about.
Rachel, We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night  and I think Emma may have caught it.
Monica, Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Rachel, Ross said he died.
Monica, He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand  botched Botox.
Rachel, Oh  great! Well  then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
Monica, Oh  maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Chandler, He saw a therapist?
Monica, Yeah  he used to have this recurring nightmare  just really freaked him out.
Rachel, Why? What was it?
Monica, That I was going to eat him.
Joey, MIKE!!!
Joey,  Okay! 
Joey, Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead  okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Joey, Atta boy!
Joey, Okay  look...
Phoebe, Joey  this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So  Mike  how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
Joey,  From school.
Phoebe, Wow  you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
Joey, Mike  'attorney at law'!
Joey, What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Phoebe, Wow  that's great! I liked that better than the law thing  so...
Joey, Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Joey, No  no  that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Monica, That's so sweet. Find anything?
Chandler, Slim Pickings.
Monica, Nothing  huh?
Chandler, No  'Slim Pickings'  it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Monica, 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
Chandler, 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Monica, Honey  that's okay. I actually know this woman  Nancy  who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
Chandler, Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Monica,  Hi  Nancy. Hi  it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen  I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah  my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No  I don't want a job in New York. Javo  is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh  wow  this is really flattering  but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah  so if you would tell Javo  'I'll take it!'
Rachel, Hi  my name is Rachel Green  I have an appointment for Emma.
Ross, Thanks doctor.
Ross, You even have to ask?!    He is alive!
Phoebe, You know  it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
Joey, Yeah  that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
Joey, That's okay Mike  I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
Joey, Please  we're trying to have a conversation. 
Phoebe, What?!
Joey, What?!
Phoebe, Do you not know each other?
Joey,  Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah  where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games.  Hey  remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
Phoebe, Mike  let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
Joey, What are you doing? I said seven!   Argh!!!
Phoebe, Joey  why did you set me up with a stranger?
Joey, Because I forgot about our date  I'm so sorry.
Phoebe,  You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you  you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Phoebe, Who are you kidding?  You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
Joey, Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey  look  if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!
Phoebe, I'm out of here 
Joey,  You're leaving too?
Joey, Good night!
Chandler, Honey  we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
Monica, You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.
Chandler, What?
Monica, So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant  Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Chandler, How far outside?
Monica, Manhattan.
Chandler, And you're thinking of taking it?  So before you said being me with me was more important than any job  but I guess now it's old job   me   new job.
Monica, I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask  but oh my God Chandler  this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Chandler, What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
Monica, Well  if you really think about it  I mean four days is not that long. I mean  I see you Monday before you go to work  and I see you Thursday when you get back  and I always work late on Tuesdays  so really if you think about it  it's really just one day. And well  if we can't make it one day  we've got real problems my friend.
Chandler, I think you should take the job.
Monica, Really?
Chandler, Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
Monica, That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, How was the pediatrician?
Rachel, Oh  I really liked him.  Yeah  it was really  really  really good.
Ross, You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Rachel, I know.  Ross still sees his pediatrician!!!  I don't care!
Monica, Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross, He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Chandler, Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
Rachel, Ross  seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Ross, Why? Why? I know it's a little weird  but hey  he's a great doctor  okay? He knows my medical history  and every time I go in there  he makes a big deal. 'Ah look  it's my favorite patient!'
Chandler, Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
Ross, Hey  I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Chandler, That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
Ross, It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Phoebe, Sure.
Phoebe, Why did you go along with that?
Phoebe, That's true.  Well  is anything you told me about yourself true?
Phoebe, Prove it.
Phoebe, That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Phoebe, You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Phoebe, Uhuh.
Phoebe, Well  like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Phoebe, It's okay. Go ahead  ask me out.
Joey, 
Phoebe,  Oh  you just caught me off guard! Yeah  that would be nice.
Joey, Look at this. My two best friends!
Ross, Excuse me  I don't mean to be a jerk  but the baby with the rash came in after me.
Ross, With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Ross, Yeah  that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
Ross, I am a single parent.
Ross, Well  let's say  I don't know  you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Ross, Hmm  yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
Ross, Hey  I helped you find Waldo!
Ross,  Oh good  you haven't left yet.
Monica, Where have you been?
Ross, I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
Chandler, Well  you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. 
Ross, Oh man.
Monica, Promise to call me when you land.
Chandler, Of course I will call you. I love you.
Monica, I love you too. 
Rachel, Okay  wow  wow  wow. Watch the tongue people  we've got a baby over here.
Phoebe, Bye Chandler.
Chandler, Awww.  Bye!
Rachel, Bye honey. 
Chandler,  What's the matter Joe?
Joey, I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Chandler, Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
Joey, Dude  you see right thru me!!  
Chandler, Well  bye Mon  bye Ross  Rachel  bye Emma!
Phoebe, Okay  bye-bye!  Good trip! 
Monica,  Chandler  wait. It goes: Old job   new job   you. This is just something I have to do.
Chandler, I know.
Monica, I love you so much.
Chandler, I know that too. 
Chandler,  Don't worry  I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know  that's how. I promise.
Joey,  Double promise? Call me when you land.
Monica, Can I talk now?
Joey, Okay  bye. 
Monica, Joey?
Joey, He had to board.
Phoebe, Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?
Ross, sure.
Phoebe, Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?
Ross, people  so why you all dressed up.
Phoebe, oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.
Ross, oh yea now um how is that going  is it getting serious?
Phoebe, oh I dunno I dunno  you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.
Ross, you know I really admire your whole dating attitude  it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
Phoebe, yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.
Ross, but you  your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Phoebe, I wouldn't say never  you know there's that guy  well what about  ok well there's gotta be someone.
Ross, There isn't that's what I'm saying. 
Phoebe, Oh my god you're right.
Ross, I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Phoebe, I can't believe I never realized this before  I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god  what's wrong with me.
Ross, no  no  no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Phoebe, I wanna get married

Phoebe, yeah well  yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Phoebe, I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, ok I can't do this.
Phoebe, well there is no Vicrum  Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship  I've never lived with a guy  and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  if that's too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close my eye's make it less awkward  You kissed me.
Phoebe, so you don't think I'm a total freak
Phoebe, I guess so  can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm  be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Ross,  This is Vicrum.
Chandler, Hi honey I'm home!
Monica,: Hi  how was your flight? 
Chandler, oh it was great.
Monica,: Here why don't you sit down  get yourself comfortable because I.  have a little surprise for you.
Chandler, well  well  well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Monica,: Ok  This is how much I love you. 
Chandler,  Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Monica,: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Chandler, no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
Monica,: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store  but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Chandler, does what always have to be sharks.

Monica,: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! 
Chandler, You are an amazing wife.  No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me  I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.
Monica,: Im very  very drunk right now.
Joey,  see ordinarily I would talk to her  but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Phoebe, you know maybe this is a wake up call  about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship  here you go from woman to woman  meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Joey, your right! I love my life!  I actually did sleep with her.
Phoebe, Oh hey you guys  I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday  so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Joey, Thursday? But that�s Halloween.
Phoebe, So?
Joey,  So spooky  that�s all.
Ross, So  so  is Mike coming to dinner?
Phoebe, No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend  and he has to work. Uch  I get mad at him  but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.
Rachel, Pheebs  I would make a reservation for five  because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to dinner?
Phoebe, Oh  Rachel!
Ross, Actually  um  I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Phoebe, Oh  yay!
Ross, Thanks  I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Phoebe, Alright  okay  so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey  you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.
Monica, What are you talking about? We�re all together right now.
Rachel, Um  Mon  Chandler�s not here.
Monica, Oh  dear god!
Chandler, Good morning everyone  it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now  before we get started  are there any questions?  Yes  Ken is it?
Chandler,  Well  don�t believe everything you hear  Ken.  But yeah  that�s true. Alright  let�s get started  by take a look at last quarter�s figures.  Ah  Claudia  aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?
Chandler, No  no  no-no-no. I smoked for years  then I quit. Right now  I can�t remember why.  You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?
Chandler, Alright  lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up  go ahead  it�s fine.  So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude  that I�m not.
Chandler,  Ken  please! No  I can�t  I can�t smoke. If I smoke  my wife would kill me.
Chandler, I always liked you  Ken. 
Phoebe,  Trick or treat! 
Monica,  Hey!
Phoebe, Ooh  and treat it is. 
Monica, Hmhmm. 
Phoebe, Wow  so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.
Monica, This is not  what I�m wearing. I�m ovulating and Chandler�s gonna be home any minute  so I thought we would try before dinner.
Phoebe, Ohh. Oh wait!  you guys won�t be late for my dinner  will you?
Monica, Believe me  Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We�ll probably be the first ones there.
Phoebe, �kay  see you there. Happy humping!  Hey�hey! Oh  wow  somebody smoked out here? Oh my god  don�t people know  you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Chandler, Actually  in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Phoebe, You smoked!
Chandler, No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example  in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
Phoebe,  Chandler  you stink of cigarettes.
Chandler, Uch  do you think  Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Phoebe, Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Chandler, Pheebs?
Phoebe,  I�m gonna go. 
Chandler,  Okay  something to cover the smell � Oven cleaner!  Unscented!
Monica,  Welcome home. I�ve missed you. join me in the bedroom?
Chandler, No thanks  I�m good.
Monica,  O-kay  so you wanna play it that way  do you?
Chandler,  Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane  so I�m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Monica, You don�t need a shower.
Chandler,  Alright  the truth is  I soiled myself during some turbulences.
Monica, What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Huh�did you smoke?
Chandler, Yes  but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay  five. A pack. Two pack�a�a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days.  But it�s over  I made a decision  I�m not gonna smoke anymore.
Monica, 
Chandler, But  those are for you.
Ross, Alright  we�ll just  uh  see when you get here. Bye.  Huh  that was my mom  she�s stuck in terrible traffic.
Rachel, Okay  well that�s now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Ross, Oh  what were the other two?
Rachel, Well  let�s see. The first one is: I don�t want to. And  you know  I�m not going.
Ross, I know  it�s the first time  we�re leaving the baby and � hey  I know how hard it is for you  but � but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She�s great with kids.
Rachel, She is?
Ross, Ya.
Rachel, What about  Monica.
Ross, Hey  you only heard Monica�s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.
Rachel, Ish. I just don�t think I can bear it.
Ross, Rachel  I know that you can. And you should.
Rachel, Uch.
Ross, Really  it would be good for you and in fact  why don�t you  why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I�ll meet you there.
Rachel, Oh-A.
Ross, No  no  really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really  the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. 
Rachel, You need to learn some new slang.
Ross, I�m serious. C�mon  you should go. Here.  No  uh-uh  just go.
Rachel, What � Oh! 
Ross, No! No  you know what?  You    the baby�s fine  now squam . Yeah   story walking. 
Rachel, I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Ross, Oh   holy molly are we in a pickle now.
Phoebe, Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.
Joey, I know  u-uch.
Phoebe, I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight  I ate nothing all day.
Joey, What about me  he? Only had one lunch today.
Phoebe, Yes  they are expected presently. Yeah  yeah um  their arrival is in the offing.
Joey, No  they�re comin�  we�re waitin� right here.
Phoebe, Joseph!  Thou needn�t worry  they shan�t be long.
Phoebe, One really does have a stick up one�s ass. Doesn�t one?
Monica, How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa  it�s chilling.
Chandler, I messed up  it was a meeting  everybody was smoking.
Monica, So what? Don�t you have any will power?
Chandler, Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs  without taking the tin foil off.
Monica, You said that was sexy!
Chandler, �kay  look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
Monica, That�s right  because I forbid you to smoke again.
Chandler, You forbid me?
Monica, Mhmm.
Chandler, You know  I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
Monica, Don�t joke  with me  okay? I�m very  very upset right now.
Chandler, Oh  would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Monica, Yes.
Chandler, Then  I might as well �  do this . Not really sure what to do now.
Monica, Well  I�ll tell you what we�re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe�s birthday dinner  so you point out put out that cigarette  we�re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Chandler, Fine. What!?
Monica, Sex! This is the last day I�m ovulating  and when we don�t do it now  we�ll have to wait till next month. 
Chandler, You serious? 
Monica, Oh yeah!
Chandler, Right  fine  I�ll do it  but no talking.
Monica, Huh  and no cuddling.
Chandler, And no kissing your neck.
Monica, Oh good  I hate it when you do that
Chandler, And lots of kissing your neck.
Ross, Okay  well the ??? is not home.
Rachel, No. Uch.
Ross, Oh-oh  wait  my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.
Rachel, Alright  I can�t  I can�t wait that long. You have to do something�knock that door down!
Ross, I would  but I bruise like a peach. Besides  y�you know  everything is gonna be fine. The baby�s sleeping.
Rachel, What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Ross, Can�t hold her own head up  but yeah jumped.
Rachel, Oh my god  I left the water running.
Ross, Rach you did not leave the water running. Please  just pull yourself together  okay?
Rachel, Ah  did I leave the stove on?
Ross, You never cooked since 1996. 
Rachel, Is the window open? Because if there�s a window open  a bird could fly in there.
Ross, Oh my god  you know what  yeah  I think you�re right. I think � listen  listen!
Rachel, Ubb.
Ross, A pigeon  a pigeon.  No  no wait  no-no  an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby  seeing this  jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird�s aid. The eagle  however  misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip  swirling around the whirl pool  that fills the apartment.
Rachel, Boy  are you gonna be sorry if that�s true.
Joey, Maybe we should just eat now.
Joey, Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves  right? But there�s still some food left on their place  okay  what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
Joey, But it happens?  I�m gotta go to the bathroom.
Phoebe, No  you can�t go. No-no-no  I can�t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move  I cave.
Joey, If you ask me to stay  I�ll pee. 
Phoebe, Okay  fine  I�ll move. Alright  you don�t have to manhandle me.  Where?  Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Joey,  Finally you guys made it.  Pheebs  who the hell�uhuhh!
Monica, Spend more time with the tie. That�ll make a baby.
Chandler, Look  I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
Monica, Oh sure  now you�re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle�s funeral
Chandler, That was a celebration of life. Alright  look  I�m not gonna do this. Alright  is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Monica, No  you�re right. Mnya  we shouldn�t do it like this. Huch. For what it�s worth  I�m  I�m sorry. I shouldn�t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes  not the end of the world.
Chandler, Mean it?
Monica, Yah.
Chandler, You are incredible. Unless  I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do  I promise  I will hide it so much better from you. 
Monica, D�you want to?
Chandler, Yeah  let�s celebrate life!
Monica, �kay.
Rachel, Och  god.  Oh  thank god  you�re okay. I�m so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.
Ross, Great. So let�s get going?
Rachel, Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened  I�m never leaving her again.
Ross, Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Chandler, Uhh. You are welcome.
Monica, You know what? Let�s not talk.
Chandler, What?
Monica, Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Chandler, But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.
Monica, Oh  blablablabaybaybay.
Chandler, Leave it.
Monica, I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn�t have sex with me while we�re fighting.
Chandler, You tricked me to get me into bed?
Monica, That�s right  I got mine.
Chandler, I feel so used.
Phoebe, Well  I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?
Joey, Thank you.  Waiter! �lright  this is gonna be fast  so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. 
Phoebe, Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Phoebe, Both it is  thank you.
Joey, Oh  uh  again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers  entrees  we don�t care.
Phoebe, You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Ross, I�m so sorry �
Rachel, We got locked out of the apartment  we �
Joey, That�s a great story�can I eat it?
Ross, And then Rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
Rachel, N-it wasn�t easy  but it�s your birthday and I did what I got to do.
Phoebe, And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Rachel, Oh honey  this is for the best  thus I�m not distracted  worrying about Emma  how she�s doing at home and I�m being completely here with you and  oh  she spit up!
Ross, What?
Rachel, She spit up. Judy! She spi�Judy! Look alive  Judy!  Thank you.
Ross, Thanks. Oh.
Rachel, Oh  ooh  everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
Joey,  Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ross, Y�know this ??? is incredible.
Joey, Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Ross, Okay  I�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Rachel, Yah  I�ll have the soup and the salmon.
Joey, And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry  because �
Monica,  Happy birthday!
Joey, Son of a bitch!
Phoebe, Wher-where have you been?
Monica, Well  we had a little fight.
Chandler, I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Monica, You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.  Ooh  uh  thanks. Wow  little tight  isn�t it? How d�you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table  but they made you move. Huh-huh  shut up Monica. Whoo  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Chandler, I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
Joey, Why are you going? He said  she wanted the shrew! 
Ross, Rach  c�mon  Emma is fine. You�re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay  you need to stop.
Rachel, Y�guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Chandler, You mean the lully story?
Ross,  Huh-huh  they already know it.
Phoebe, You guys  we�ve been waiting for you for a long time  maybe you should order.
Joey,  No  no  it�s okay  I already told the waiter what they want.
Monica, Why would you do that?
Joey, Chandler  control your woman!
Rachel,  Okay  as everybody has ordered  I would like to start the celebration and make a toast � to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
Phoebe, Aw � what?
Rachel, N-no  Emma dropped her sock.
Monica, Mom�s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today  she told me she was out of town.
Rachel, Ross  she still has not noticed that the baby�s sock is on the ground.
Phoebe, �s a good toast.
Rachel,  Could you please get her attention?
Ross, W-oa � Mommy! 
Phoebe,  Oh  for god�s sake  Judy  pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I�m sorry  was that rude? Di-did my  my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this evening? Look  I know  you all have a lot going on  but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn�t even have the courtesy to call.  Well  it�s too late now.
Ross, Well  ??? think that�s us?
Phoebe, well  this is  this is  this is not over!  Hello?
Joey,  Well  what is going on with you two?
Monica, Uch  you see  I�m ovulating.
Chandler, Oh yeah  that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all  maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Monica, Yes smokie  that is what it was. I just can�t get enough.
Chandler,  You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
Joey, So? Did have sex  right?
Chandler, What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?
Phoebe,  Okay  that was Mike.
Rachel, Phoebe  hi  we�re so sorry. You�re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Phoebe, Mhuh  guys  that means the world to me. Huh  nkay  I�m gonna take off.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, Oh  I love you guys too  but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait  I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.
Rachel, Oh thank god  if Phoebe�s going  can we please take Emma home?
Ross, You know  I think that�s a good idea�our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet.  Bye  y�guys.
Monica, Bye.
Joey, See ya. Well  this is just us.
Monica, So  I�m  I�m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
Chandler, So you never had sex with a Kennedy  have you?
Joey, Do  do you gonna do it now?
Monica, We don�t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct �
Joey, No-ohoh. 
Joey, Nah  just me. All alone.  Dinner for six for one  uh  you boys are about to see something really special.
Joey, Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Joey, Joey! Joey.
Joey, That�s the best birthday ever.
Chandler,  Hello?  Hello?
Monica,  I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Chandler, Honey  you're screaming.
Monica, YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Chandler,  Oh  that's great.
Monica, Yeah  a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Chandler,  Awesome.
Monica, Oh  and the people are so nice. There's this one guy  Geoffrey  he's the Maitre D.  Chandler  you will love him. He is without a doubt  the funniest guy I have ever met. 
Phoebe, I know! 
Phoebe, Yeah  I kinda do.  Well  how's this? 
Joey,  Aaahhh  look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?  Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me  huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh 
Phoebe, I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Phoebe,  Maybe not  is it?
Phoebe,  I know Mike  why don't you keep digging?
Phoebe, Oh  it's a key. To be honest  I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Phoebe,  Oh wow  ooh! Ooh  big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Phoebe, Oh no  I want to.
Phoebe, Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that  you know  I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. 
Phoebe, It really is.
Joey,  Oh  I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! 
Rachel, So I don't go back to work for another four weeks  but we would like our nanny to start right away  so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
Rachel, That's great  great. So do you have any questions for us?
Rachel, Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... 
Ross, Thank you.
Rachel, Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Ross, Boy  we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Rachel, Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross, Oh  come on Rach  we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse  we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel,  What  the blonde with no bra?
Ross, She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay  okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education  uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Rachel, Okay... 
Ross, And she's a little mannish...
Phoebe,  Oh my God! David!
Phoebe,  No! It's a great time  come in...! WOW  hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
Phoebe, Who cares  it got you here.
Phoebe, Wow. Where is your luggage? 
Phoebe, A-Allright  well... I'll call the cab company.
Phoebe, Thank you! God  no! You should see me when... Oh actually  no  I look pretty good.
Phoebe, No...
Phoebe, I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica, Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Phoebe, He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Monica, Oh  well... That had been your window.
Phoebe, Yeah! I mean  I don't know. I was just   I was looking  I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just  he's so irresistible.
Monica, Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe, Really? Chandler?
Monica, Continue...
Phoebe, Oh.Okay  then it gets worse  'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, I know!  Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much  you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica, Wow  isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe,  Uhuh... Yeah...!  you know. And given my life long search for irony  you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica, What are you gonna do?
Phoebe, I mean I guess  I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know  complicated moral situation  no right  no wrong...
Monica, You have to tell David!
Phoebe, Okay  I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.
Chandler,  Funniest guy she's ever met!  I'm funny  right...? What do you know  you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes...  Save it for inside! 
Monica, Heeeeeey!
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know  they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah  I'm from the waistband  Wyoming. But when I was seven  we headed over to the crotch.
Monica,  Was your cabin pressurised?
Chandler,  And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Chandler, What's with the word y'all? You know  just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that  because if so  I say why stop there? You know  your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter  waiter excuse me  I'll have the fricken?  See  that's... that's funny with the fricken  right?
Monica, No  it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy  Geoffrey  right?
Chandler, Yeah  he came up...
Monica, Well  he did this bit... You probably had to be there  but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer  eating a raw chicken. 
Chandler,  Were you there?
Phoebe, No  but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
Rachel, Sandy  that's exactly what it is...
Ross, Are you gay? 
Rachel, Ross!
Rachel, Oh!
Rachel, Oh  that's pretty.
Ross,  So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Ross,  Okay.
Ross, Yeah  kids say all kinds of crap. 
Rachel, Oh God  she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Rachel, Oh  that would be great!  I love him  I love him  I love him...
Ross, Oh  come on  Rach  he's a guy!
Rachel, So wh..? He's smart  he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Ross, Because  it's weird!
Rachel, Why?
Ross, What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
Rachel,  Yes?
Ross, King?
Rachel,  Please?  YES! Sandy you're hired.
Rachel, Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Ross, You gotta be at least bi...
Chandler, Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later  when Monica is around  I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Joey, Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Chandler,  Well  thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Joey, I know  right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Chandler, Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Joey, Seriously? She actually said that?
Chandler, Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey, Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Chandler, Yeah!
Joey," Without that  you just got ""lame with women""."
Chandler, Ye.... 
Monica, Hi! There you are.
Joey,  Fire trucks! 
Phoebe, Oof...
Phoebe, Oh  wait  wait!
Phoebe, No  no  it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well  uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
Phoebe, Yeah  I should have told you.
Phoebe, I'm sorry  I'm sorry.
Phoebe, I am happy.
Phoebe, Well... but David  just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Phoebe, Of course  yeah. You know  a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
Phoebe, I mean... 
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, Well  if that's what they do in Minsk...  In New York... it's... 
Rachel,  Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...
Ross,  Is everything allright?
Rachel, Oh yeah  it's fine  it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.
Rachel, I can't... I can't hear it again.
Ross, And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach  can I... can I see you for a sec?
Rachel, Yeah!  Excuse me... 
Ross, Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Rachel, Look  Ross  he's just... Sandy is just sensitive  that's all.
Ross,  Okay  okay  see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. 
Rachel, What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ross,  Yeah  I mean  all things that guy...  These are amazing!
Rachel, Sandy made Madeleines.
Ross, This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies  huh? They're not even... butch  manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. 
Rachel, Well  I... you know  I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean  I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know  'cause I gotta tell you Ross  it not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Ross, Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Rachel, Okay  what? What is too sensitive? 
Phoebe, Hmmm... No  no... No  I can't do this. It's bad.
Phoebe, No  no. No.
Phoebe, Look David  if... if you had never left  then... yeah  we'd probably still be together right now  but... you did leave  and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...
Phoebe,  And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.
Ross, Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica, Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross, Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder  recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Monica, Oh... How are they?
Ross,  Lighter than air...  But that's not the point. 
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey,  Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Ross, Thank you!
Joey, That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross, ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica, Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey, Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway  hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica, Yeah  so?
Ross, Wow!
Joey, Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica, Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God  that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey, So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know  like Ross's thing is... 
Ross, Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey, ...No... 
Monica, I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey, Monica  you have to do some damage control here  okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... 
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler, What are you guys talking about?
Ross, Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 
Chandler, You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? 
Chandler, You know  I don't mind a... male nanny  but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. 
Monica, Ohhh  ooohhh... you are on a roll  mister!
Chandler, If I'd known you guys were coming over  I would have brought more pizza. 
Monica, Okay  okay... Chandler you... you stop it! 
Chandler, What is so funny about that? 
Monica, Well  I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean  you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! 
Chandler, Did you tell her what we talked about? 
Joey, Yeah....
Chandler, So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? 
Monica, Honey  listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Chandler, Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica, Well  you're... you're different funny... I mean  you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well  he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Chandler, I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler  whose wife made him die inside.
Monica, Honey  you know I think you're hilarious! Come on  you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.
Ross, Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! 
Joey, Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross, Yep! That's my thing...
Phoebe, No  no  no  no  no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Phoebe, No  uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago  and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Phoebe, No  no...
Phoebe, Oh  well  yeah...
Phoebe, Stop it! Stop it  before someone gets really hurt!  Here David  you should just go.
Phoebe, Okay  well... guys?
Phoebe, I'm sorry  I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back  I totally understand.
Phoebe, Right! Never! Never! I swear! 
Joey, Yeah! Allright! Hey  hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.
Ross, Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Joey, Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... 
Ross,  I swear to God...! 
Joey, Me! I'm up for puppets!
Ross, Okay  okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
Joey, I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. 
Ross,  Oh my God!
Rachel, That was kind of rude!
Ross, Oh  I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
Rachel, You know  he was just doing his job...
Ross, Well  you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Rachel, Oh  come on Ross...
Ross, No! Hey  you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Rachel,  Oh... That's true.
Ross, Thank you!
Rachel, Well  you're the one who wants to fire him  so you're gonna have to do it. 
Joey,  I am learning so much from you.
Chandler, Well  I'm off to Tulsa  so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes  tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Monica, Honey  you can relax. Last night at work  Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that  not so funny anymore.
Chandler, Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart  people!
Monica, Okay  don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler, I love you too.  And... I like you as a friend. 
Joey, Allright. See you later!
Chandler, See ya! 
Joey,  Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica, Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard  I swear... a little pee came out.
Ross, Here goes...
Rachel, I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. 
Ross, Sandy... Hi  we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.
Ross, Yeah  uhm... I mean  Rachel and I  think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Rachel,  YOU! You feel!
Ross, I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Rachel,  Oh  damn you Geller!
Ross, Anyway  uhm...Well  I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Ross, No  you know  it's uhm... nothing you did  it's... it's uhm... my issue.
Ross, You know  I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Ross, Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Ross, I mean  uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Rachel,  Huh ha ha!
Ross, I play squash...! Anyway  uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Ross," It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you  why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?"
Ross, I know I am!  ...And when it's summer  and it's hot  why can't you wear a tank top?
Ross, Here come some more...
Joey, Wow! You blow my mind...
Joey, Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Joey, It's like the cheapest college ever.
Ross, And that's why  no matter what mommy says  we really were on a break.  Yes we were! Yes we were!  Come here gorgeous.  Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby  you know that? But you've got...  You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.  Big baby butt! I like big butts.  I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty  bitty  waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God  Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God  you've never done that before  have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh  huh? Well  daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon...  I'm a terrible father!
Chandler, Hi!
Joey, Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
Chandler, How come?
Joey, Well  I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Monica, What do you do with your money now?
Joey, Well  I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
Chandler, Do you have any ideas?
Joey, Uh  yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends  helping to plant the emus...
Monica, Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Joey,"  Yeah! Right!  People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: ""Excuse me  I'll have a bucket of fried bird.""  Or... or maybe just a wing or... "
Monica, Joey  I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean  I think in this market  real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.  That's right  I know some stuff!
Joey, Real estate  huh? Hmmm...
Monica,  Oh  and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Chandler,  Oh  and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
Monica, My dad told me. They play golf together.
Chandler, Oh  well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.
Phoebe, Hi!
Phoebe, Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight! 
Monica, Wow  the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Phoebe,  Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
Monica, They just gonna love you  just be yourself.
Phoebe, They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!
Rachel, Oh yeah  she can't be herself.
Phoebe," Okay  so... allright... Which dress?  You can say ""neither""."
Monica, I'm sorry honey  but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Rachel," Yeah  totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father  you know  you want to flirt a little bit  but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh mr. Pincer  I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."""
Monica, You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Rachel, Uh  he took the SAT's for me.
Monica, I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Rachel, Ssshyeah  well  duh! I mean...
Phoebe, So... now... What about with Mike's mom?
Rachel, Oh  with the mother  just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me  moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
Monica,  She said WHAT?
Phoebe,  That's she's like the daughter she never had.  Listen! 
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous  it's so sweet!
Ross, Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Rachel,  You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?
Ross, Yeah  and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
Rachel, Well... well  what did you do to make her laugh? 
Ross, I uhm... Well  I sang...  well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back... 
Rachel, You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?
Ross, But you know what  if you think about it  it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
Rachel,  owwwww...
Ross, Please don't take her away from me!
Joey, Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler, So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
Chandler, mmm That's enough about you!
Joey, Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Chandler, No  no  no  no  no  NO! No  no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Joey, Well  you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Chandler, We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art  this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here  do you? 
Joey, You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh  oh  oh  let me see...  Yeah  I could see it.
Chandler,  Look at these videos. You know  I mean  who does he think he is? Magnum Force  Dirty Harry  Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
Joey, What?
Chandler, There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Joey, Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...  Wait a minute... This says Monica...  And this is Richard's apartment... 
Chandler, Get there faster! 
Phoebe, I'm wearing pantyhose!
Phoebe, Oh  thank you! Oh... Oh my God  you're RICH!
Phoebe, Yeah  so... They gotta die someday.  HELLO!
Phoebe,  Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Phoebe, And you... Your home is lovely.
Phoebe, Holy crap!
Phoebe, Oh  try and stop me!
Phoebe,  I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
Phoebe,  Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Phoebe,  Uhm... Okay  well  allright  uhm... Originally I'm from upstate  but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison  so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while...  which was okay  that was okay  until uhm... I got hepatitis  you know  'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway  now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist  uhm... which  you know  isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes  huh...  So... where does everyone summer?
Phoebe, God! God! This is not going well.
Phoebe, Okay  okay  okay  okay... Still sure about me being myself?
Phoebe, So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...
Phoebe, Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...
Phoebe, Yeah I bet! Look out! 
Phoebe, Oh my God  are you okay?
Phoebe, I'm so sorry!
Phoebe, I really  really am sorry.
Phoebe, Yes... I'm sorry  I've never met a boyfriends parents before...
Phoebe, Yeah okay... yeah  your mom... okay... She looks nice  I can talk to her.
Phoebe, Yeah... Oh Bitsy  hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.
Phoebe, Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.
Phoebe, Well  and you know  it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.
Phoebe, Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.
Phoebe,  Oh no  no  no  no  no  no. Don't get me wrong. No  he's not in like a sissy way. No  no  no... when he gets going  he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...
Chandler, I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean  what good could possibly come from watching?  Well  we know I'm gonna watch it. 
Joey, Hey dude  what's up?
Chandler, Don't judge me  I'm only human!
Joey, Did you take that tape?
Chandler, I had to! Okay  imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
Joey, I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Chandler, Some girl...!?
Joey, She hot?
Chandler, Yeah...!?
Joey, How did she get me to settle down?
Chandler, Allright  I'm gonna watch it... I mean look  it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?
Joey, Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else  I tell ya...
Chandler, Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
Joey,  What? Whoo... What?
Chandler, Just for a few seconds  so I can know what it is... Please?
Joey, All right  fine... But if I enjoy this  you have only yourself to blame... 
Chandler, Why am I hearing cheering?
Joey, Well it's okay  its like... its just a football game.
Chandler, Football? Just football?
Joey, Yeah  see... you were all worried for nothing.
Chandler, It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What the...  What are you doing?
Joey, You don't wanna see what I just saw! 
Monica, What are you guys doing?  Oh my God  is that Richard? 
Rachel, Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...  Not funny huh? Oh so  is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just  you know  rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap...  My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh  I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much  and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody...  I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face...  Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!  I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are  you really do like big butts  don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo... 
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful  beautiful sound that...
Ross, Oh I know  isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Rachel, Oh! You know  I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...
Ross, You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
Rachel, Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...
Phoebe, ...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat  Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it  but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.
Phoebe, Oh  Pervert Parade?
Phoebe, Oh  Ode To A Pubic Hair?
Phoebe, Oh God! Is that veal?
Phoebe, Oh no  no  no  no... That's okay  that's okay... I mean  I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no  veal I love...
Phoebe, No  no  no  I actually it's any baby animals: kittens  fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this  this nice vein of fat running through it...  Hmmm... yummy  Hmmm... 
Monica, So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Chandler, Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Monica, That tape was never meant to be seen by...  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.
Joey,  Monica  look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore...  Not ready to joke about it yet  okay  I see you later. 
Monica, Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?
Chandler, Because that's who I am  okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Monica, Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?
Chandler, This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Monica, Isn't that sad? I mean  can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Chandler, Oh  yeah  well  poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Monica, Chandler  this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.
Chandler, Yeah  oh  but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Monica, Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life! 
Chandler, Oh  good  good. Play more  'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Monica, THAT'S NOT ME!
Chandler, What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Monica, That bastard taped over me! 
Chandler, Is that a problem?
Monica, I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape  Doctor!
Phoebe, Yeah... The woman you what?
Phoebe, I love you too...
Phoebe, YEAH...! How great is this...? 
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, I had a great time.  It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
Ross, She sweat  wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.
Rachel, So fellas
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, fellas
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, has your girlfriend got the butt?
Ross, Hell yeah!
Rachel, So shake it! 
Ross, Shake it!
Rachel, Shake it! 
Ross, Shake it!
Rachel, Shake that nasty butt...
Ross, Baby got back 
Rachel, One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie  you other br... 
Ross, Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Monica, Hey Hon  could you help me get the plates down?
Chandler, Yeah. Hey  here's an idea  why don't we use our wedding china today?
Monica, No  I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.
Chandler, Honey  she keeps canceling on us  take the hint.
Monica, What if something gets broken  they're so expensive.
Chandler, What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Monica, Ok  but if something gets broken  and then the Queen comes over..
Chandler, I will explain it to her.
Monica, <laughs> Oh yeah  like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.
Joey, wow  the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Chandler, Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
Joey, Oh my God!
Chandler, Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
Joey, Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
Chandler, What are you going to do?
Joey," I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp  that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot."
Chandler, Well you proved them wrong.
Ross, A lot of people are thankful for those.
Rachel, Who is it?
Rachel, Hide my rings.
Rachel, Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>
Rachel, Um... hi.
Rachel, Aw.
Rachel, I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Rachel, Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Rachel, Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina  <shakes head no> not the same thing.
Rachel, mh hmm..
Rachel, Uh.... its Emma.
Ross, Hey Amy.
Rachel, Oh Amy  you remember Ross.
Ross, That was me.
Monica, Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!
Chandler, I'll tell you what  for the rest of our lives  I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Monica, I know  after you left the store  I chose different ones.
Chandler, Why?
Monica, well no offense honey  but your taste is a little feminine for me.
Chandler, Oh suddenly  flowers are feminine?
Phoebe, Hey  everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
Joey, Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>
Phoebe, Hey  what's going on Joe?
Joey, I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Phoebe," Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!"
Joey, No  no  no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
Phoebe, Ooh  honey. You stink at lying.
Joey, I do not.
Phoebe, Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house  I went to the bathroom and when I came back  my muffin was gone-who took it?
Joey," Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in  went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?"
Phoebe, Don't worry  don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.
Joey, Oh great  that'd be great. Thank you.
Phoebe, Sure  what.. what was the work thing?
Joey, Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was  rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe  she looks>
Phoebe," ""Pick up grandma at the airport""?"
Joey, Oh.. man..
Rachel, Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>
Ross, Sure  we don't live there but...
Rachel, Yeah  no. Ross has a PhD.
Rachel, God she is unbelievable.
Ross, I know  I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Rachel, Oh sure Ross  yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant  I want you there with your fossil brush.
Rachel, What? What happened?
Ross, Don't say that.
Rachel, Oh Amy  don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross  could I talk to you in private?
Ross, Sure  you want to go upstairs?
Rachel, Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Ross, You know  I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
Rachel, Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go  and she's my sister. Alright  she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
Ross, Ok  fine  but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Rachel, Ross  you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!
Rachel, Hey you guys  this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler  Joey  Phoebe and you know Mon.
Joey, Pheebs  I still need some help here
Phoebe, Oh right  ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking  people know you're lying.
Joey, Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Rachel, Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Phoebe, Thats a great movie. <she claps>
Ross, Emma.
Phoebe, PHOE-BE.
Rachel, Honey  I don't know how to tell you this  but um  if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.
Ross, Well we haven't offically asked them yet  but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Chandler, I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Monica, yeah oh my god  I'm so moved.
Rachel, See look Amy  we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey  you don't seem very connected to the baby.
Chandler, You know  guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean  we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father  but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
Monica, Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.
Monica, Okay  just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>
Joey, Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Monica, No  honey  its. thats a special plate.  See its a game  whoever gets that plate wins.
Joey, I can't believe I won.
Rachel, Monica is Ross' sister.
Monica, That was me.
Rachel, Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
Monica, Now see  this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.
Chandler, No  if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma  Right?
Rachel, Well actually...
Chandler, Actually what?
Ross, well.. its just. its just in that case  then um. Emma would go to my parents.
Chandler, What?
Chandler, So if Monica's not around  then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
Joey, Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Chandler, Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Rachel, Honey  you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
Ross, Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Monica, Thats not how you see me  is it?
Chandler, Look  I may not know a lot about babies  but do you really think I'm not capable?
Ross, No  you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Chandler, Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
Ross, Sure  Monica would have to give her up.
Joey, I lie better then that  right?
Chandler, So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die  I get Emma. Then my wife dies  then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
Phoebe, There's your movie! <claps>
Monica, Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.
Chandler, Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Monica, Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.
Chandler, Yeah but they're right. I mean  I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Monica, No you learn these things. You grow into it.
Chandler, Yeah  but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Monica, I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.
Chandler," Oh yeah  well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?"
Monica," Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?"
Chandler, You said that to me last week.
Monica, How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.
Phoebe, It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
Joey, Oh  I like that  yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Phoebe, Ooh  what happened?
Phoebe, No! Nothing with a raccoon.
Joey, Arg... Alright  I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>
Monica, Oh wait.. What are you doing?
Joey, Setting the table.
Phoebe, Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
Monica, Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
Ross, Hey dude  you okay? Sorry about before.
Chandler, Oh no thats okay  you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die  you don't get Joey.
Rachel, UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>
Rachel, Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Rachel, What? What carrer?
Rachel, Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
Rachel, Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Rachel, I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Ross, Emma.
Joey, ooh oooh..
Rachel, uh huh.
Rachel, Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You  your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Rachel, Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
Rachel, I cannot  I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Rachel, ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.
Rachel, You take that back.
Rachel, Take it back!
Rachel, Heey man  I work out.
Rachel, I do pilates.
Rachel, Bring it on!
Monica, Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!
Rachel, Did you just push me?
Rachel, Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>
Phoebe, Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Joey, What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Rachel, Ew! Gross.
Chandler, Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out  but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
Rachel, Mon  I'm so sorry.
Chandler, Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
Chandler, By the way  that fight was totally arousing.
Ross, Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die  and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
Chandler, Oh yeah? Well thanks.
Ross, So  so now do I get Joey?
Chandler, Okay  but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Rachel, Are you okay Mon?
Monica, uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.
Phoebe, It's all right. You can mourn.
Joey, Actually its not pies  its just pie.
Monica, I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.
Rachel, Look Amy  it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
Rachel, Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
Rachel, She needs changing.
Chandler, Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess  I'll be the one who dies first.
Phoebe, Hey  does Monica know about her broken plates yet?
Chandler, Nope...
Phoebe, Broke them all  huh?
Chandler, Yep...
Phoebe, You gonna tell her?
Chandler, Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know  I think you were right  I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Monica, Like only if the queen comes?
Chandler, Maybe not even then. 
Joey, Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency  he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
Phoebe, No problem! Next week: stealing... 
Monica, Bye plates!
Joey, Oh  you told her you broke all the plates  huh? 
Monica, What? Something happened with the plates?
Joey, Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
Phoebe, ...sprang to his sleigh  to his team gave a whistle;
Joey,  Wow  that was great! You really wrote that?
Phoebe,  Uh-huh.
Chandler,  Say goodbye elves  I'm off to Tulsa.
Monica, I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Ross, You're really not coming back?
Chandler, Yeah  we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done  I'll be fired.
Monica, It's so unfair  you don't even like your job!
Chandler, So  who does?
Phoebe, Oh  I like my job.
Joey, I *love* my job.
Rachel, Yeah  I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Ross, I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Chandler, I'm sorry  I won't be here.
Monica, It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week  but for Christmas... alright  if this is what you have to do  I understand.
Chandler, Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.
Monica,  You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Chandler, Did I not mention that?
Monica, No!
Chandler,  AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! 
Chandler," All right everybody  I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families  but there's *no* call  for writing ""Screw you  Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way  you can all call me Chandler."
Chandler, Hey. Where've you been?
Chandler,  You hear that? You may not be with your families  but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
Chandler, Y'know what  I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York  told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
Chandler, Well  that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look  you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
Chandler, I'm sorry. Hey  at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning  you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses  wich  by the way  none of you have invited me to.
Chandler, Haha  no thanks!
Chandler, Oh  thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
Chandler, Typical Christmas-y stuff  you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
Phoebe, So here is a  a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. 
Rachel, Okay  Pheebs  you look in the kitchen  I will look in the back closet.
Chandler, I can save you time ladies  I'm right here.
Phoebe, Yeah  Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Rachel, We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Chandler, What? That's terrible!
Phoebe, No-no  we do it every year!
Chandler, Oh well  that  that makes it not terrible.
Phoebe, No  yeah  we never find them! She's always best at us  that wily... minx.
Rachel, Don't worry  we're just gonna search here for an hour  and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search  OK?
Chandler, No not okay  you can't look for Monica's presents!
Phoebe, Oh no  we have to!
Chandler, No  you don't have to  and you can't because I  I live here too.
Phoebe, Well then  you should look with us.
Chandler, Why?
Rachel, Chandler  aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
Chandler, No  I have a great idea for a present for her.
Phoebe, Oh  that's it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.
Rachel, Chandler  that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present  two medium presents  and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
Chandler, If I help  we can find 'em faster!
Rachel, That's right!
Phoebe, Ooh ooh  we have a live one!
Rachel, Oh  it's a Macy's bag!
Rachel, Oh.
Phoebe, Ooh  who's it for?
Rachel,"  ""Dear losers  do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler  I knew they'd break you."""
Joey, Rach  these are for you.
Rachel, Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey, No  but with this new car smell  you'll think you do.
Chandler, OK  Pheebs  your turn.
Phoebe, Ahh  toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Joey, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, You guuuyys.
Joey, And for Ross  Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Ross, You got me a cola drink?
Chandler, And  a lemon lime.
Ross, Well this  this is too much  I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Chandler, And last but not least.
Joey, They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Ross, Ooh  hey Ben  what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Ross, Yeah!
Monica, Come on Ben.
Ross, Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
Chandler,  Ho  ho  ho! Merry Christmas!
Chandler, Hey! 
Ross, What are you doing here  Santa?
Chandler, Well  I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here  weird...turtle-man?
Ross, I'm the Holiday Armadillo  your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
Chandler, What?
Monica, Okay Ben  why don't you come open some more presents  and Santa  the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Ross,  What are you doing?
Chandler, You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume  so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Ross, Thank you  but  but you  you gotta leave.
Chandler, Why?
Ross, Because  I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah  and  and you're-you're wrecking it.
Chandler, But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
Ross, I'm sorry Chandler  but this  this is really important to me.
Chandler, Fine  I'll give the suit back.
Monica,  Hey  you think  you can keep it another night? 
Chandler, Santa? Really?
Monica, Yeah  is that okay?
Chandler, Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Monica, No.
Chandler, Then it's okaaay! 
Chandler, You know what  everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
Chandler, Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright  look  go! Go home  okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
Chandler, Good  God's speed  good people!  You're not gonna go?
Chandler, Ah. Thanks.
Chandler, Ah.  Chandler Bing.
Monica, Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
Phoebe,  Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
Chandler, Ahh  Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Monica, So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Chandler, Ah  well no  it's just uh  me and Wendy.
Monica, Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
Chandler, It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Monica, Umhmm  umhmm  about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
Chandler, I sent them home.
Monica, Ohh  you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
Chandler, Uhh  uh...
Ross,  Answer faster  answer faster!
Chandler, I don't know!
Ross,  Answer better  answer better!
Chandler, I don't think of her that way  you know  she's a  she's a colleague.
Monica, What does she do there?
Chandler, Oh  she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Monica, She did WHAT?
Chandler, BE-LOW me!
Joey, Ahh  wait  is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Monica, *What*??
Chandler, Well  she... she didn't win...
Monica, Alright  well  maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
Chandler, Well  second prettiest that year; I mean  of *all* the girls in Oklahoma  she's probably...
Rachel,  Oh Chandler  stop talking!
Chandler, Honey  there's really nothing to worry about.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, I'm serious!
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, Merry Christmas.
Monica, Merry Christmas.
Chandler, Merry Christmas  you guys!
Phoebe,  Blah blargah  blar-blab.
Chandler,"  The wife says ""Hi!""."
Chandler, Ah well  she's got this weird idea  that  uh  y'know  just because you and I are alone  that something is gonna happen.
Chandler, This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about  but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
Chandler, Whoa-ho  back off  Missy! 
Chandler, I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
Chandler,  No ... no...  NO!  Look  I'm  I'm married!
Chandler, I'm *happily* married.
Chandler, Right. So  I'm sorry...
Chandler, Well look  it's not easy to spend this much time apart  you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or  in this case: right on money! ... You know  she's amazing  and beautiful  and smart  and if she were here right now  ...she'd kick your ass. Look  you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But  what I have with my wife is pretty great  so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
Chandler, I mean  you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
Monica, Really?
Chandler, You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Monica, Well  not anymore.
Chandler, But we don't do that.
Monica, I know  I just thought it would be fun.
Chandler, How drunk are you?
Monica, Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Chandler,  That's the perfect amount!
Monica, Okay!
Monica,  Y'know what's weird?
Chandler, What?
Monica, This doesn't feel weird!
Chandler, I know.
Monica, You're a really good kisser.
Chandler, Well  I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?
Monica, Hm-hmm!
Chandler, Okay!
Monica, Wow! You are really fast!
Chandler, It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Monica, We're gonna see each other naked.
Chandler, Yep!
Monica, Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Chandler, Count of three?
Monica, One!
Chandler, Two!
Monica, Two!
Chandler, Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Monica, Eh  we weren't that close anyway!
Chandler, Eh! 
Chandler, So  are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Monica, Well uh  you and I are just goofing around  I thought  why not just goof around with him.
Chandler, Y'know  I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well  I have  and the technical definition is  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me  then we have to  y'know  get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.
Monica, I think you're better than you think you are.
Chandler, Really? Okay  so...
Monica,  Know when to stop.
Chandler, Y'know  I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Monica, Yeah.  Don't do the dance.
Chandler, Right!
Monica, I can't get married until I get something old  something new  something borrowed  and something blue.
Chandler, Okay  all right  all right  all right! Okay!  Okay  here's something  here's something blue and new.
Monica, You're so efficient. I love you!
Chandler, Let's go! 
Monica, No-no-no  wait! We need something old!
Chandler, Oh  okay  I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Monica, That'll work!
Chandler, I don't think so.
Monica, Okay  now we just need something borrowed!
Chandler,  Here just...take this. 
Monica, That's stealing!
Chandler, No  we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Monica, Ohh. 
Chandler, Okay  one thing at a time. 
Monica, Listen umm  I've been thinking  it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean  you work  you work really hard for that.
Chandler, Ehh.
Monica, Eh  you work for that.
Chandler, Look  I thought about it too  and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Monica, You do?!
Chandler, Yeah  I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look  when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy  then  then that's what we're gonna do.
Monica, Oh  you're so sweet.  Oh  but wait  what about our  what about the future and stuff?
Chandler, Eh  forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids  y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Monica, You thought about that?
Chandler, Yeah.
Monica, How many kids were we gonna have?
Chandler, Uh  four  a boy  twin girls and another boy.
Monica, What else did you think about?
Chandler, Well  stuff like where we'd live  y'know? Like a small place outside the city  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course  we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Monica,  Y'know what? I-I don't want a big  fancy wedding.
Chandler, Sure you do.
Monica, No  I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
Chandler, You sure?
Monica, Uh-hmm.
Chandler, I love you so much.
Monica, I love you. 
Rachel,  Oohh  I love it!
Ross, Really? You're not gonna return it?
Rachel, Well  not this second!
Phoebe,  Hey look  you guys  it's snowing!
Rachel, Oh wow  it's so beautiful...
Ross, Wow  it really is!
Monica," ""Wendy"" is a fat girl name."
Phoebe, Aren't we done with that?
Monica, Okay  fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa  where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Oh my god...
Joey, Hey-heeyyy - Look at that  it's a Christmas miracle!
Monica, What are you doing here?
Chandler, I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Joey, Hey  hey  uh  who did you miss the most?
Chandler, Monica.
Joey, Got ya. 
Chandler, I never want to leave you again!
Monica, But I thought if you left  you get fired.
Chandler, Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
Monica, What?
Ross, What  you  you really quit your job?
Chandler, Yeah! It's a stupid job  and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Rachel, What do you really want to do?
Chandler,  I have *not* thought this through!
Monica, Oh my god!
Chandler, I know  I  I should have talked to you first about it.
Monica, No  I think that this is what you wanna do  I think it's great!
Chandler, Thanks!
Phoebe, Chandler  your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
Chandler,  Ahh...
Phoebe, Now give me my real gift.
Phoebe,  Thank you.
Chandler,  Here  pass these  will ya.. 
Ross, Oh  hey...
Ross,"  ""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?"
Rachel, Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
Chandler, I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides  this gift still says I love you guys.
Joey, Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Chandler, I don't have a *job*!
Chandler, Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...   Hey  d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
Monica, You are!  Hey  here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, Good morning  Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
Chandler, I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Monica, Well  I just lost my erection.
Chandler, I mean  what am I supposed to do with myself?
Monica, You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Chandler, But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
Monica, Hey  wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications  and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Chandler, Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
Monica, I know!!! My erection is back!
Joey,  Thank you!
Phoebe, Joey  can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Joey, Okay.
Joey,: Pheebs  have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?
Phoebe, I'm sorry  it's just  I'm a little short on cash.
Joey, If you want I could loan you some money?
Phoebe, Oh no  no  no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No  that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
Joey, Oh  hey  how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Phoebe, You could do that?
Joey, Yeah  yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Phoebe, Oh my god  I'm gonna be on TV!
Joey, Okay  now. I gotta tell you  being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Phoebe, Oh  really?
Joey, No it is awesome!
Ross, Hi guys.
Phoebe, Wow! Hey  why are you all dressed up?
Ross, Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Joey, She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
Rachel," Well  because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!"
Ross, I think she's gonna be the hit of the office  huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
Monica,  Okay  I have looked through a bunch of career guides  photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
Chandler, How long was I in there?
Monica, Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
Chandler, Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
Monica, Don't you want to look through the rest?
Chandler, I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time  though.
Monica, You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh  now I get to use my shredder!
Chandler," I mean  I can write slogans. I mean  how hard can it be  right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"""
Monica," I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."""
Chandler, Honey? Leave it to the pros.
Monica, I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
Chandler," ""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."""
Monica," ""Marriage. It's not for everybody."""
Rachel, That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Ross, Yeah  after you punched that one guy who got it wrong  word spread.
Rachel, I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?
Rachel, I'm the hell person whose office this is!
Ross, Good one  Rach.
Rachel, Excuse me?
Phoebe, Joey  look at me! I'm a nurse!
Joey, Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry  I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So  are you excited about your scene?
Phoebe, Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
Joey, Oh  relax. Don't be. You'll be fine  you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
Phoebe, Okay  now. What?
Phoebe, I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Phoebe, Okay  that helps.
Joey, Hey  you know what? Don't worry  Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright  eight.
Chandler," No  no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."""
Chandler, Really? That's great!
Chandler," It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid."""
Chandler, Actually  we're trying  and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually  she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Rachel, Wait a minute! What do you mean  you're taking over my job?
Rachel, A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Rachel, Alright! Don't get too comfortable there  because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
Rachel, Excuse me?
Ross, Rach we have a code brown situation.
Rachel, Can you please  please take care of it for me?
Ross, Alright  but you have to do one sometime.
Rachel, Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
Rachel, That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
Rachel, Oh yeah  what department was that? The Jerk department?
Rachel, Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Rachel, Oh  hi Mr. Zelner.
Rachel, That's great. So now  Super Gavin  when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
Rachel,  Oh  wow. Super ass-kissing power.
Rachel, Today.
Rachel, No  I said today! See  for a superhero  not so much with the listening.
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey. So  what did he say?
Joey," Well  he can be a little rough around the edges  so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot  with the word ""puppy."" Okay  so he said: ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together  I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""
Phoebe, I'm sorry  I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Joey, That's right  you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
Phoebe, Joey.
Joey, No  no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey  she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor  because if she doesn't  people die!
Phoebe, Who dies?
Joey,  Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
Phoebe, Yes  doctor.
Joey, Okay.
Phoebe, Hang in there  Man With Eye Patch  your tray is coming!
Phoebe,  Yes  I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Phoebe, Okay  from the top  people!
Rachel, Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today  they were gonna fire me.
Ross, What? No  that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Rachel, Alright  alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
Ross, What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
Rachel, I know. You know  we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
Ross, Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Rachel, Come on  I don't know what else to do.
Ross, Fine  fine.  We'll have fun  won't we? Yes  we will  yes we will. 
Rachel, Ross?
Ross, Huh?
Rachel, You're pretty.
Chandler, Whatever I decide to do  I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
Ross, So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Chandler, Yeah.
Ross,  Good-bye.
Monica,  Okay  it's baby time. Pants off Bing.  Didn't see you there Geller.
Chandler, Yeah  Ross is here so...
Ross, Yeah  and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Monica, We're gonna have sex.
Ross, I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Monica, Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Ross, Pants off Bing!
Rachel, Alright. Now that I'm back  why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
Rachel, Hey  they were popular when I left!
Rachel, Well  I should be involved in that  so why don't you get me up to speed?
Rachel, Oh  no no no no. I see what you're doing here  alright  listen  this is my job buddy. Okay  I've had it for five years  and I know how it works  so why don't you just catch me up!
Rachel,  Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
Rachel, Fine  I will.  Alright  fill me in!
Ross, Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
Chandler, Oh  yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course  by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Monica,  Hi  good morning lover. I gotta say after last night  I'm a little weak in the knees.
Ross, Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
Monica,  Sorry.  But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Chandler, Oh god  I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
Monica, What are you talking about?
Chandler, That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Monica, What!? You faked it?
Ross, You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean  it's better  open collar. You know  it's more casual 
Phoebe, Joey  listen. I can't do this  it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse  and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Joey, Oh  sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Phoebe, Well  it's not okay  because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
Joey, Maybe you are a nurse  but you moonlight as a waitress.
Phoebe, Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother  supporting my two children.
Joey, Nice.
Phoebe, Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
Joey, No  no. See  you and Drake are having a fight.
Phoebe, About what?
Joey, He slept with you and then never called you.
Phoebe, And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
Phoebe, Yeah  well  I'm very angry at him  because he slept with me and never called me back.
Joey, Oh  calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
Rachel, Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes  but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Rachel, Except that!  Oh  hello  Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Rachel, What? I can't do that! I have the baby  and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
Rachel, Well  there you go. You win  you win. You get to do the presentation  you'll knock 'em dead  no one will ever remember that I worked here  and then Ralph will buy his helicopter  and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
Rachel, No  I can't  I have a baby.
Rachel, Why would you do that?
Rachel, That's really nice.
Rachel, Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry. Thank you  thank you.
Joey, Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
Joey, Thank you  thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow  I'll bring you a hat  cover up the bald?
Joey, Hey  listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director  and he was thinking  maybe this time you don't hit Drake  you just wait on the tables?
Phoebe, I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Joey, You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Phoebe, Wait a minute  I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
Joey, What?
Phoebe, Yeah  I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well  rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Joey,  Yeah  you can fire her  but I would call security  she won't go easy.
Monica, You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
Chandler, Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Monica, Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides  why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
Chandler, That's actually why. Look  I'm starting a whole new career now  and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby  I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Monica, Like a month?
Chandler, Or a year?
Monica, Really  you want to wait a year?
Chandler," It could be less than a year. I mean  you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts  but longer.""  It'll probably be more than a year."
Monica, I really wanna have a baby.
Chandler, Yeah  me too. Look  I'll just get my old job back.
Monica, No  I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
Chandler, I quit and you learn what I do?
Monica, It's just  I think  there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean  now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this  but I think once the baby comes  forget about all those reasons.
Chandler, I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Monica, It's gonna be really scary. I mean  god. When we have a baby  there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean  the apartment's gonna be a mess  I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer  because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
Chandler, Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
Monica, Yes  please!
Chandler, Oh  and I promise  I will not fake it this time.
Monica, I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
Chandler, Hey
Joey, Hey. So where's Mon?
Chandler, Oh  she's at home  putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
Joey, And you're not helping?
Chandler," I tried  but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping."
Ross, Hey you guys!
Rachel, Shhh don't say that loud  Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Ross, Uh  good news everyone  we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly  Chandler  Joey.
Ross, Ooh  somebody's getting a little fussy.
Joey, You damn right I am  I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Rachel, Ok  you know what  I'm just gonna take her outside.
Rachel, OK  thank you.
Joey, Yeah  you too.
Rachel, Oh  wow  Molly is just great!
Ross, Yeah.
Chandler, Yes  Bravo on the hot nanny.
Rachel, What? You really think she's hot?
Chandler, Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
Rachel, And Joey?
Joey, How do you think she's doing?
Rachel, Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Ross, Eh  I mean  I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Rachel, Thank you! 
Chandler, Now that Rachel's gone?
Rachel, So hot I cried myself to sleep last night. 
Phoebe, Hey Mike  what's the capital of Peru?
Phoebe," No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle."
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe,  Oh  whew  no  that's Bob.
Phoebe, Well not so much a pet as  you know  an occasional visitor who I put food out for  you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
Phoebe, What are those?
Phoebe, OK  fine  if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.
Phoebe, So weird  you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers. 
Rachel, Hello.
Rachel, Gavin  I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.
Rachel, Well  when we first met  you know  I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...
Rachel, No  I just mean that  you know  first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
Rachel, Hello.  But you know what  hey  new day  new leaf  I am just really really happy ...  I'm sorry  obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.
Rachel, I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!
Rachel, Oh wow  you are really  you're really a creep.
Rachel," Oh yeah  I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin  please  please look at my ass"".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean  I just think you are totally inappropriate  ok? This is a work environment  she's your subordinate."
Rachel, That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two  I wasn't some creep staring at his ass  we had a deap meaningful relationship.
Rachel," It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know  like Cher  or  you know  Moses."
Rachel, Oh  you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant  you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!
Rachel, Yeah well what are you  his boyfriend?
Joey, Man  I wish I had a nanny like you.
Joey, Sure.
Monica, Would you stop staring at her?
Chandler, I wasn't staring. I was leering.
Monica, What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Ross, Yeah  obvious beauty's the worst. You know  when it's right there in your face. Me  I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
Chandler, Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica, Yeah. Hey  that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
Ross, Ok  I'll be home right after work. Ok  by Emma-Wemma-Demma  I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
Monica, They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
Rachel,  Hey  listen  Joey  about Molly  I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Joey, Why not?
Rachel, Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to  you know  drive her away.
Joey, So  what  you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah  sounds about right.
Ross, Come on  there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her  ok? Just  she's off limits.
Joey, Oh  man  why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!
Ross, What are you  a child?
Joey, Yes!
Ross, Joey  come on now  for me! Please  just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Joey, Fine. 
Monica,  Take me home! 
Phoebe, Hey Mikey
Phoebe, What are you doing?
Phoebe, To kill Bob??
Phoebe, No  Mike  I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and  and you know  set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Phoebe, I'll find Bob  I'll get him. Bob?  Bob! Robert!  Oh wait  I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
Phoebe, I don't know  I kinda like Bob for a girl.
Phoebe, Oh my god  we killed Bob!
Phoebe, Suzie? 
Ross, Whazzup??
Chandler, Seriously dude  3 years ago.
Ross, Listen  can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey  make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
Chandler, You don't trust him?
Ross," Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter  the ""hot nanny""."
Chandler, Is this really your long term plan  for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Ross, You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man  I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two  but for now can you please just do this for me?
Chandler, Allright  fine  but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something  more often than not  he's going to have sex with it.
Ross, Well we gotta do something  ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees. 
Chandler, Picturing that tree?
Ross, I am  yes.
Chandler, Where you going  Joe?
Joey, For a walk.
Chandler, Oh. You mind if I join you?
Joey, Actually  that will be long. You know  I really need to organize my thoughts.
Chandler, Your thoughts? Plural?
Joey, Allright  fine  I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny  I gotta see her!
Chandler, I'm afraid I can't let you do that  Joe.
Joey, Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this  huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Chandler, Yes  as a matter of fact he did  so I can't let you go.
Joey, Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Chandler, Great novels?
Joey, Fine ... mediocre porn
Rachel, Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!  Hello  this is Rachel Green  how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son 
Rachel, Um  excuse me Gavin  I have a question I need to ask you.
Rachel, If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Rachel," Oh  please  I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact  from now on  I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you  you ""momma's boy""  starting right now."
Monica, Hey Rach!
Rachel, Hi!
Monica, Ready for your birthday lunch?
Rachel, Yeah I am  I am! Oh  but first of all  Monica  I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Monica, Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Rachel, Oh no no no no no  Gavin can't  he already has plans  most likely with his mother.
Rachel, Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Monica, You were just being so nice to him!
Rachel, I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Rachel, Hey  Mr Philips  nice suit!
Monica, Right there! That was so fake!
Rachel, Shh!
Rachel,  I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright  he is the last person I want to see.
Monica, Oh  you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Rachel, God  I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up  the guy hates me.
Monica, Does he?
Rachel, What?
Monica, Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Rachel, Oh  Monica  you think Skippy liked you? Honey  all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.
Rachel, Oh  ok  thank you.   Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Monica, Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me! 
Joey, Hey Rach  so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Rachel, Yeah  sure!
Joey, Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh  see you later 
Monica, Hey Rach  somebody got you shoes!
Rachel, Oh  give me! 
Phoebe, Be careful  be careful! These are my rat babies!
Rachel, Ahhhh   you brought rats to my birthday party?
Monica, So this is what a stroke feels like.
Phoebe, I had to bring them! We killed their mother  they're our responsibility now. You know  they require constant care. You should know that  Rachel  you're a mother.
Rachel, Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
Phoebe, No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home  we need feed them.
Rachel, whhh wait  you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?
Phoebe, Well I'm sorry Rachel  but I'm not like you  ok? Not everyone can afford help. 
Ross, Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Chandler,  I'm sorry  I got a little occupied.
Ross, We have to stop them before something happens!
Chandler,  Right behind you  big guy! 
Joey, So you see  Molly  what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
Joey, Oh  I didn't go to college.
Joey, Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Ross, Molly  ah  do you mind giving us just a minute?
Ross, Thanx.
Joey,  Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Ross, What do you think you're gonna do  have sex with her right here on my couch?
Joey, No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know  this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her  and might want something real?  Look  the truth is  I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel  ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.
Joey, Ok 
Ross, Yeah  come on in. Molly?
Ross, Ok ...  Well  uh  Joey  I guess we have no problem.
Joey, It's like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess  the stable boy and the lesbian!
Phoebe, Ok  ok  you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.
Phoebe, Well  you know what  they're our responsibility now.
Phoebe, Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Phoebe, No.  wh - get off your sister! Oh my god  what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ...  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?
Phoebe, Yeah  ok. I guess you're right. Allright  so we should just give them away. But to nice families  with children  and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.
Phoebe, You must think I'm crazy.
Phoebe, Good. It's just so hard  it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories  you know  from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.  I haven't told you about that yet  have I?
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, Hi. Thanks for the party  honey. Should I help you clean up?
Monica, No way! You had your party  now I have mine! Is everything alright?
Rachel, Yeah  I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Monica, Well  at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .
Rachel, Mmm hmm.
Monica, Oh  we weren't talking about you. No  no way to recover.
Rachel, No.
Rachel, Well  it was  and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ... 9:30?? God! Oh  this party was lame ...
Monica,  Again  you're welcome.
Rachel, Oh  you bought me a present! Why?
Rachel," Aww. Well  ok  well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin"""
Rachel,  Awww  awww  it's beautiful.
Rachel, See  Gavin  you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
Rachel, Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Rachel, You do?
Rachel, See? Why  Gavin  why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you  you go and you ...  and you do that ... 
Chandler,  First I was afraid  I was petrified 
Phoebe,  Hey
Chandler,  Hi
Phoebe, Listen  I think I've left something here.
Chandler, Oh  well someone left this . This is yours?
Phoebe,  No  but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
Chandler, Oh  uh  well  I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.
Monica, Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! 
Phoebe,  Ooh  maybe that's him!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Chandler, Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever
Ross, OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Chandler, No!
Ross, OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Chandler, Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said
Ross, Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony 
Chandler, So are you gonna...talk to her?
Ross, Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on  that's fine!
Chandler," You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!"
Ross, No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
Chandler, No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
Ross, I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
Chandler, Dude  don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
Ross, Well  and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
Chandler, Why did I get married?!
Joey, Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I
Phoebe, Well it depends.
Joey, On...?
Phoebe, On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Monica, No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to 
Joey, Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
Phoebe, Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Joey, Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
Phoebe, Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Joey, Hey hey! You dye your hair!
Phoebe, I'm a woman!
Joey, Arghhh! Double standards!
Phoebe, Oh before I forget  are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Monica, Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
Phoebe, But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there  forgot all of the words  flipped out
Monica, It's just  I'm not good at singing.
Phoebe, Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Monica, No no  it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Phoebe, OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
Monica, So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
Phoebe, While drinking...
Monica, I'm there!
Rachel, Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
Phoebe, Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
Rachel, No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
Phoebe, Oh my god.
Monica, You kissed him?
Rachel, Yeah. It was after the party  we were on the balcony and...
Monica, Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
Phoebe, It was the end of the party  you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Monica, Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Rachel, You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and  oh and he gave me this scarf...
Monica, I thought you hated him?
Rachel, You know honey  there is a thin line between love and hate  and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Monica, So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
Rachel, I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy  you know  I have the baby  and I have Ross  and I just...I don't
Monica, Sounds like you need to think about what you want  talk to Gavin  and you definitely should talk to Ross
Rachel, Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Phoebe, Wow! Five-month maternity leave  you're back for four days  kiss a co-worker  call in sick  they are lucky to have you!!
Joey, Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Joey, Chandler Bing.
Joey, OK Thanks.
Joey, Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Joey, Oh good...
Joey, All right let's just do this.
Joey, Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!
Chandler, Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
Ross, Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Chandler, Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male  divorced three times 
Ross, That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Chandler, What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
Ross, I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
Chandler, Maybe she didn't move on  you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
Ross, No no  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Chandler, Did she go out with him?
Ross, No. When he called  I...I threw the message away.
Chandler, Ah! The high road...
Ross, You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Chandler, Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
Ross, You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us  like college  remember? You...you break the
Chandler, I thought I had to make the jokes!
Ross, Don't you have to be at work?
Chandler, Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler  here's my friend Ross right here  and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.
Ross," Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: ""Would you..."
Chandler, We still got it!
Rachel, Who is it?
Rachel, Why?
Rachel, Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on  I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin
Rachel, I a not gonna lie to you  I'm pretty sick
Rachel, Oh no no no
Rachel, So did I
Rachel, It's just a cold
Rachel, What? What's the matter?
Rachel, Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
Rachel, Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything  don't worry about Ross really  really.
Rachel, I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
Rachel, Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
Rachel, Right  right  yes!
Rachel, What?
Rachel, No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.
Rachel, OK.
Rachel, I thought it was Ross.
Rachel, There isn't. There is totally isn't.
Rachel, All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here  which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in
Rachel, Yes
Rachel, People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
Rachel, So seriously...rodeo clown?
Phoebe," ""No time for losers  'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" Thank you!"
Phoebe, Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
Monica, No I told you I can't.
Phoebe, But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
Monica, What have you heard me sing?
Phoebe, All the time when you're cooking.
Monica, What?
Phoebe," Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy  I've got love in my tummy"""
Monica, Yeah I do rock that one.
Phoebe, OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Monica, Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Monica," ""Delta Dawn"""
Ross, Hi! I could help not notice  but that's an unusual necklace
Ross," Right  so that's a firm ""no"". I cannot believe this  I just keep striking out."
Chandler, I don't get it neither  I mean you're obviously desperate  you're asking women how they want to be killed
Ross, This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler, By drowning or...?!
Chandler, Well...
Ross, I know! 
Monica, Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Phoebe, Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica  when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone
Monica," Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn"""
Phoebe, Can you totally see through her shirt ?
Monica," ""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"""
Joey, Hey  I need your help.
Chandler, Wow  it seems serious. What seems to be the problem  Ashley Judd?
Joey, Look  I'll get new headshot taken  all right  so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
Chandler, I am sorry  moment to make fun of that  please!
Joey, You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right  it hurts so bad  I could only let her do one
Chandler, It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Joey, All right  look  you got to help me out  ok? Look  I have the magic marker  I want you to fill in the skinny one so
Chandler, Ok. First of all  this is green!
Joey, What the hell am I supposed to do!
Chandler, All right  I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Joey, What  what.
Chandler, Ok  you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage  well I earned mine
Joey, Oh my God!
Chandler, Yeah  well  I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
Joey, Ok all right  no  no  no  no  I do  I do  I do  I need your help  but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore
Chandler, Oh  not with my combination of ice cubes  aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Monica," ""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry  the song is over. Did you see me out there?"
Phoebe, Every little bit of you!
Monica, I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people  and they liked me! Hey  did you hear that
Phoebe, Mon'  not that you didn�t sound good  but...
Monica, Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.
Ross, But  what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
Ross, Uh-ah!
Ross, . Good choice Ross.
Rachel, Oh  hey! Hi  there you are  I�ve been looking for you everywhere!
Ross, Oh  yeah  hello  well  now  here I am.
Rachel, Listen  my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a
Ross, Oh  yeah  yeah that�s Michelle.
Rachel, Who?
Ross, Oh  just this woman I�ve been seeing.
Rachel, You�ve being seeing someone?
Ross, Yeah  didn�t I mention that? Yeah  I mean  we haven�t being going out for too long  but rather there is this
Ross, How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh  I am sorry Michelle  that�s
Rachel, Hi  and I am also Emma�s mother.
Ross, I told you about my daughter.
Chandler, And done!
Joey, Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey  are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around
Chandler, Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
Joey, Yeah  yeah. Hey  they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Chandler, Yeah  yeah  I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about
Joey, Thank you so much.
Chandler, No problem.
Joey, Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent  we should add some manly make up for it.
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, Comb my eyelashes.
Monica, Ok  for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh  how about the Pointer
Phoebe, Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Chandler, I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
Monica, Honey  you�re just in time  I�m about to sing another song!
Chandler, Really? In front of all this people?
Monica, And they love me!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Yes  she gives the people what they want.
Monica, All right  watch!
Monica," ""Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen  tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this"
Chandler, Are those my wife�s nipples?
Phoebe, Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before  I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Chandler, I gotta stop this.
Monica," Oh  who cares  they still love me! ""I am so excited..."""
Chandler, You  touching yourself  out!
Rachel, Wow. She does that a lot!
Rachel, What  what  wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor  yet? How long have you known her  like
Ross, I told you it wasn�t long  but there is an amazing connection between us.
Ross, Are you kidding?
Ross, We�ll see.
Rachel, Ok  Ross  what�s going on here  are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
Ross, I don�t know  are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Rachel, How do you know about that?
Ross, Through the magic of sight! I was here  putting our child to sleep...
Ross, When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know  for what? A week?
Rachel, Oh  that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
Ross, Ok  Michelle  it�s time to go.
Ross, Ok.
Ross, You know  if it�s meant to be  I�ll guess it. Bye  bye.
Rachel, Score.
Ross, Oh  I am sorry  did you not like her  because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
Rachel, Oh God  I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss  one guy  one time!
Ross, Oh  really!
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Oh  really!
Rachel, Oh yeah.
Ross, What about the guy from the bar?
Rachel, What? Who?
Ross, The guy you gave your number to.
Rachel, Whoa  how do you know about that?
Ross, Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing 
Rachel, Why didn�t I get that message?
Ross, What?
Rachel, From the guy in the bar  why didn�t I get that message?
Ross, Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Rachel, Ross?
Ross, I never gave it to you.
Rachel, Why?
Ross, I don�t know.
Rachel, Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
Ross, Who am I?
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
Rachel, Oh my God  I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you
Ross, None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Rachel, Oh  Ross  this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they
Ross, Uh  clearly.
Rachel, And you know  we said that we would  we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this  you know 
Ross, Yeah  maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Joey, Ha  oh  of course.
Rachel, Thank you.
Joey, Your eyebrows look weird.
Chandler, �Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine  never understood a single word he said  but I helped him
Joey, Morning  roomie!
Rachel, Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Joey, Fifth day's a charm.
Rachel, Oh  Joey  it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you  you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
Joey, Hey  it's great having you back. You know  stay as long as you want  and when does she stop crying all night?
Ross, Hey  you're not naked! So hey  Rach  when will we expect to see you tonight?
Rachel, Well  I'll probably be back to pick her up around six  but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep  so...
Joey, She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
Rachel, Bye!
Ross, Bye! Hey  I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Joey, No  hey  it's been great.
Ross, Yeah?
Joey, Yeah. And look  I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything  all my feelings from before are totally over  okay? And even if they weren't  when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
Ross, Yeah  that'll do it.
Joey, Wow! So  how are you?
Ross, I'm  I'm okay.
Joey, Really?
Ross, Sure  I mean  do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know  I'm disappointed  but it's not like it's a divorce.
Joey, Well  actually it...
Ross, No  it's not a divorce  it is not a divorce! Anyway  I think Rachel and I need to  you know  get on with our lives  maybe  maybe start seeing other people.
Joey, Wow  really?
Ross, Yeah  sure  why not? In fact  if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Joey, Sure  I know lots of girls.
Ross, Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Joey, Ooh  names?
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Phoebe, What you got?
Phoebe, Goodie! Thanks. So  how is it living with Rachel again? I mean  apart from the great food.
Joey, I'm fine  I'm fine  it's just  it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know  yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Phoebe, Oh my god  Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
Joey, Why are they doing this?
Phoebe, I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
Joey, You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it  like two bites in here?
Phoebe, I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
Joey, I know  I know. And when they moved back in together  I figured y'know  that's where things were headed.
Phoebe, I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
Joey, Yes  and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Phoebe, You know what? Maybe once they start dating  and they see what's out there  they'll realise how good they are for each other.
Joey, Yeah  because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
Phoebe, So  what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
Joey, I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Phoebe, Yeah.  Oh  I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates  so that they'll realise how good they are together.
Joey, Ooh  that's a great plan!
Phoebe," Yeah  you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh."" "
Joey, Shhh! Not so loud  we don't wanna wake up  uh...
Rachel, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, You guys aren't doing anything tonight  are you?
Chandler, See  now  why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip  happening people. Now  if you'll excuse me  I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Rachel, I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Monica, Sure  we'll do that. What are you up to?
Rachel, Well  Phoebe set me up on a date.
Monica, Oh my god.
Chandler, Wow.
Rachel, Why? What's the big deal?
Monica, Just figured  'cause you and Ross are...
Rachel, What  slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah  I'm all set.
Chandler, Well  I think it's great that you're going on a date  you know? I mean  it sounds healthy. I mean  you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Monica," You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah "" and send out a resume!"
Rachel, So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
Monica, Oh  it's perfect.
Rachel, Oh  you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh  a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food  she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair  'cause she likes to grab it. And oh  she's also in this phase where if you leave the room  she screams bloody murder  but ah... Thanks  you guys. Have fun!
Phoebe, Ooh  Joey.
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
Joey, All right! Who is he?
Phoebe, Well  it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage  I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah.
Joey, She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Phoebe, A teacher?
Joey, Yeah  yeah  she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh  oh  she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on  who loves puzzles?
Phoebe, Well  Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey  you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
Joey, Oh my god  you're right!
Phoebe, Yeah.
Joey, She even reads for pleasure!
Phoebe, How do you even know a woman like that?
Joey, What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Phoebe, Joey.
Joey, I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Phoebe, So now what do we do?
Joey, Well  okay  I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled  and find him somebody else.
Phoebe, What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off  but we don't tell Ross  and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
Joey, Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Phoebe, Ooh  so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date  Ross gets stood up  and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
Joey, Ah  yes  The Plan! 
Phoebe, It's not Santa's plan. No  it's... 
Joey, Yeah  you know  it's not that fun.
Phoebe, No  I think we killed it.
Chandler, Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well  I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
Chandler, No  no  no  no! No  no  no  no! It's okay  it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry  it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
Monica, Okay  just so you know  I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth  so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Chandler, I don't do that.
Chandler, I'll try to stop. Wait  did you say until the sixth?
Monica, Yeah.
Chandler, Today is the sixth.
Monica, No  it's not.
Chandler, Yes  it's also 2003.
Monica, Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Chandler, It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Tough crib.
Monica, Hey  where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Chandler, I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
Monica, Chandler!
Chandler, I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
Ross, Excuse me  is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height  dark hair  perhaps doing a puzzle?
Ross, Well  if I'm still here in an hour  buy him a drink on me.
Ross, Nah  I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
Ross, Yeah  it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Ross, No!
Monica, We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Chandler, Oh  good  because as of four o'clock this afternoon  I am not.
Monica, So  let's do this.
Chandler, I - I don't think I can.
Monica, Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore  but give it a minute.
Chandler, Because of Emma.
Monica, Oh my god  Emma. Oh  sweetie  I forgot you were here. Oh  you're right  we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
Chandler, Sorry.
Monica, Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean  how much can she even be aware of at this age?
Chandler, Well  she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Monica, Canoodling?
Chandler," Well  I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y."
Monica, I don't know. I mean  I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
Chandler, Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Monica, I guess you're right.
Chandler, You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast  you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Monica, But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
Rachel, Wow  everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
Rachel, Oh  well  that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
Rachel, What?
Rachel, Well  come on  Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey  now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
Rachel, Really? What's that like?
Rachel, Really?
Phoebe, Hello?
Rachel, Phoebe  it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Phoebe, Hey  Rach!
Rachel, This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Phoebe, You know  you are talking about one of my dear  dear friends.
Rachel, I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Phoebe, Oh  right  so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
Rachel, He's not stoned.
Phoebe, Did he go out for a cigarette?
Rachel, Yeah  four times.
Phoebe, My dear  sweet Rach.
Joey, Oh  great  pretty soon they'll be back together.
Phoebe, By the time anyone's figured out what we've done  we'll be in sunny Mexico.  Oh  wait  that's the end of a different plan.
Monica, She's asleep. Chandler?
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Emma was doing it!
Monica, She's asleep.
Chandler, Ooh  she's asleep  that means we can...
Monica, Yes  but we have to be fast.
Joey, Hello?
Joey, Emma? Hey! Hi!
Joey, How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters  huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
Joey, You can't have S-E-X  when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Ross, Eh  if it was meant to be  it's meant to be.
Ross, Wow  free crab cakes. Well  that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Ross, Just the crab cakes.
Ross, What's - what's going on?
Ross, What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Ross, This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now  if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes  I'll be on my way.
Monica, Well  that was weird. You were loud  and I was fast.
Chandler, I think we may have really done it this time.
Monica, Oh  I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
Chandler, You may wanna get some more of those too.
Chandler, Where's Emma?
Monica, Oh my god  where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Chandler, Don't ask me  I was in there canoodling you!
Monica, Okay  okay  I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall  and I'll call her cell.
Chandler, Okay. 
Monica, Hey  you better hope that we're pregnant  because one way or another  we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
Rachel, No  no  no  I admire a man who can cry.
Rachel, Don't touch my coat!
Rachel, Oh  sorry  it's my phone. Hello?
Rachel, Oh my god  this is the worst date ever!
Monica, Hey  did you stop by here?
Rachel, No.
Monica, Oh my god  then...
Monica, Oh  thank god! Emma  there you are!
Rachel," What? What do you mean  ""there you are""? Where was she?"
Monica," Oh  we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just � she loves it when I'm dramatic."
Joey, Because you two were having sex!
Monica, No  we weren't!
Joey, Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Chandler, All right  all right  we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Joey, Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
Chandler, No  no  no.
Monica, No  please don't. Please  Joey. She will kill us!
Joey, Hey  I gotta! Unless...
Monica, Unless what?
Joey, Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Chandler, What? Why?
Joey, Hey  I may never have kids  and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
Chandler, Your family name is Tribbiani.
Joey,   You almost had me.
Rachel, Well  uh...
Rachel, Really  really not.
Rachel, All right  well that's good to know. Good night  Steve.
Ross, Hey  what's wrong?
Rachel, I just had a rough night.
Ross, Oh. Crab cake?
Rachel, Eww!
Ross, Well  what happened?
Rachel, Oh  well  I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this  but...
Ross, Monica told me you had a blind date.
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, I did  too.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Rachel, Oh  oh no. Do you think she walked in  saw you and left?
Ross, Why does everyone keep saying that?
Rachel, Well  if it makes you feel any better  I wish my date hadn't shown up.
Ross, That bad?
Rachel, Well  he makes t-shirts for a living  and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
Ross, Female body inspector? What size is that?
Phoebe, Now  wait a minute. So  they're gonna name their first child Joey?
Joey, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
Joey, It's easy  you just walk in on them having sex.
Phoebe, Oh  so they owe me like  three Phoebes.
Phoebe, Oh my god! Look  it's Ross and Rachel. Oh  the plan is working.
Phoebe, Don't  don't do the plan-laugh.
Ross, The first date we've had in months  and they were both such disasters.
Rachel, Oh. Huh. You know  it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
Ross, Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean  that's just stupid.
Joey, We're geniuses! Yeah  look at them  look at them  they're really bonding.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  they're falling in love all over again.
Phoebe, Oh  they see us! Oh  they  they look mad. Oh  they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
Joey, Where?
Phoebe, Mexico!
Joey, Can you believe they're still not here?
Ross, I know. A double blind date  and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Joey, I know  I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
Joey, We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.
Chandler,  Guys  guys  I've got great news! Guess what…
Joey, Uh  ah  Monica's pregnant?!
Monica,  Really?  Let's get past the moment.
Phoebe, What's your news?
Chandler, Thank you. I got a job in advertising. 
Monica,  Oh  honey  that's incredible!
Phoebe,  Gosh  what's the pay like?  Oh  come on people…  come on  now  if I don't know who makes the most  how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey! 
Chandler, Actually  it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Joey, Oh  that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Chandler, Right. So  it'll be the same except… less sex with you. 
Ross, So  uh  what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Chandler, Well  it's a training program  but at the end  they hire the people they like.
Phoebe,  That's great.
Chandler, Yeah  I mean  there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink  you know  grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
Chandler,  Humiliating and noble!
Ross, You know  if I didn't already have a job  I think  I would have been really good in advertising.
Monica," Ross  you did not come up with ""got milk?"""
Ross, Yes  I did  I did!  I should have written it down!
Joey,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Joey, Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.  ... and I smelled bacon. 
Monica, He just left.
Joey,  Who did? 
Rachel,  Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
Joey,  She did?
Rachel,  You got it!
Joey,  I did?
Monica, What is she talking about?
Joey, I don't know  but it sounds great.
Rachel, Your agent called. You got that audition.
Joey, With Lennart Haze?
Rachel, Yes.
Joey, Oh my god  that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre  not that little one underneath the dally like last time.
Monica, Is it a good play?
Joey, Well  it must be  because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.
Rachel, Yeah  and Lennart Haze is starring in it…
Joey, Yeah  yeah  and directing.
Monica,  He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
Rachel,  You saw that?
Monica, No  but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
Joey, Yeah  he's done some amazing works.
Rachel, Oh  yeah. Oh  I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
Joey,  I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone. 
Monica, Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Joey,  Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Chandler,  Good morning  everybody.
Chandler, Oh  no  no  I'm an intern  just like you guys… except for the tie  the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.
Chandler, Yeah  well  I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and  you know  you gotta start at the bottom.
Chandler, Right. Look  I know I'm a little bit older than you guys  but it's not like I'm Bob Hope 
Chandler, The comedian? USO?!
Joey, It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.
Joey," Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!"""
Joey, No  I-I-I wasn't making fun of you  honestly  I-I think you were great in those commercials.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey,  Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon…
Joey, Wow!
Joey, Oh  yah  sure.
Joey," Err  ""I think you know""."
Joey," ""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."""
Joey," ""I can't. Oh  I want to  long pause  but I can't."""
Joey,  Oh  oh  I thought that was your character's name  you know  I thought you were like an Indian or something  you know with a… 
Joey," Ah  y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent  you know  Southern  ""I could go right now  maaan!"""
Joey,  Ah  hi  ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit  but  ah  look  if you just tell me what I did wrong  I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And  and also:  'How you doing?'  You should  please  just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better  please.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, I really doubt that.
Joey,  Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Phoebe, Hey  do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
Ross, Oh  I can't. I've got a date with that waitress  Katy  yeah  I know we've been only going out like twice  but I have a really good feeling about her.
Phoebe, Oh  I hear divorce bells.
Ross,  What?
Ross, O-ok. Just relax  Phoene  just stay calm. . Oh my god  I can't find my wallet.
Phoebe, No.
Ross,"  What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death  Phoebe Buffay."
Phoebe, Lowell  is that you?
Phoebe,  Oh my god!
Phoebe,  I'm sorry  Ross  this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell  Ross.
Ross, Yeah  a real pleasure.
Phoebe, Ah  it's been so long  so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!
Phoebe, Good for you!
Phoebe, Ouh… 
Ross,  Oh my god. Phoebe  you used to mug people?
Phoebe, Excuse me  Ross  old friends catching up…
Monica, Hey  how did the audition go?
Joey, Well  they wanna see me again this afternoon  but  err  well  Lennart Haze did not like me. 
Monica, What happened?
Joey, Well  he said I wasn't urgent enough  you know  and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh  and he said that I should think less.
Monica, So far so good! 
Chandler,  Honey  I'm old!
Monica,  What's wrong?
Chandler, I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Monica, So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.
Chandler, Yes  but I don't think life experience with these. 
Joey, Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!
Monica, What are they? 
Chandler, They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Joey,  I give you $ 500 for them!
Chandler, What am I supposed to do with these?
Monica, Ah  come on  sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.
Chandler," Well  first of all  they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently  they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"".  And here  look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause  apparently  walking is too much exercise. Kids  kids  roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?"
Monica, Okay  have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
Chandler, No  I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Joey, Hey  that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
Ross, Hey  you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!
Monica, You okay?!
Ross,  Yah  because Phoebe knew the mugger!
Monica,  How do you know a mugger?
Phoebe, I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
Ross, You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Monica,  Seriously?
Phoebe, Well  I'm not proud of it  but  you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…
Monica,  Phoebe  that is awful!
Phoebe, Well  ok  I wasn't rich like you guys  ok  I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life  my mother was killed by a drug dealer…
Monica, You're mother killed herself!
Phoebe, She was a drug dealer!
Ross, Well  anyway  it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him  because  I was about to do some serious damage!
Phoebe,  Okay…
Monica, Well  this must've brought back some really bad memories for you  Ross.
Phoebe, Why?
Monica, Well  Ross was mugged as a kid.
Phoebe,  You were?
Ross, Yeah  it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know  I-I-I was just there minding my own business  you know  seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Monica,  Wonderwoman!
Ross," Anyway  I was heading towards this bakery  you know  to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone…  … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money  punk!"""
Phoebe,  Oh my god…
Ross," I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy"""
Monica, Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
Ross, A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Monica, That's it.
Ross, Well  I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way  Phoebe?
Phoebe, No… actually  you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works.
Phoebe, Okay  I think we have a problem here.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Well  uhm  back in my mugging days  you know  I  uhm  I worked St. Marc's Comics.
Monica, Yeah?
Phoebe, Well  a pipe was my weapon of choice and  uhm  pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
Monica, So?
Phoebe, Well  there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
Monica, Oh my god!
Phoebe, I know… I mugged Ross!
Joey,  I know  I'm sorry  but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Joey, But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Joey, Actually  I really need…
Joey, Yes… ahahaaa 
Joey,"  ""I think you know!"""
Joey," ""I am what you made me! You know what?"""
Joey," ""I could go right now."""
Joey,"  ""I  oh  I can't. I want to  but I can't!"""
Joey,  I did?
Joey, Sure  yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go. 
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset  you know  to see if it sparked anything…
Rachel, Oh  anything yet?
Chandler, Yes  how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
Joey,  Hey!
Joey, Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?
Monica, No  that seems about right.
Joey, Yesterday at my audition  I really had to pee  and apparently  having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back  so I'm drinking everything. Oh  by the way  that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Rachel, Joey  that was formula.
Joey, We gotta get more of that. 
Chandler,  You know what… these aren't half-bad!  You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Rachel, Okay  first of all  that's stupid and second of all  I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Chandler, Alright  I feel youger already!
Chandler,  Yah  I think I broke my hip.
Phoebe,  Hey  you!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey  how was class?
Ross, No one ever asked me that  what's wrong?
Phoebe, Nothing  I really wanna know.
Ross, Oh…  Well  uhm  there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…
Phoebe,  Alright  nothing is worth this. Uhm  I have a confession to make… uhm  okay  you know  that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…
Ross,  Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Phoebe, You don't have to lie anymore  Ross  I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.
Ross, No  it wasn't.
Phoebe, Yes  it was.
Ross, No  it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
Phoebe,"  ""Gimme your money  punk!"""
Ross,  Oh my god  it was you! I can't believe it  you… you mugged me?
Phoebe,  Yeah  and I'm so  so sorry  Ross  I'm sorry  but  you know  if you think about it  it's kinda neat.  I mean  well  it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider  you know  the rest of you have these connections that go way back and  you know  now  you and I have… have a great one!
Ross, It's not the best!
Phoebe, I know  I'm sorry  please forgive me. I don't know what to say…
Ross,  There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Phoebe, Really? Even more humiliating than…
Ross,  Hey  let's not do this!
Chandler, Okay…  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
Chandler," A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control  you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then  a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs  and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"""
Chandler, Oh  thank you  sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me 
Chandler,  I don't know  I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset  you know  and it just started to flow.
Chandler, The cold weather hurts my hip!
Phoebe, Hey  Ross!  I know you're still mad at me  but can I just talk to you for a second?
Ross, Sure  go ahead. Whoops  sorry  sure  go ahead. 
Phoebe, I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Ross,  Oh my god  crap from the street? 
Phoebe," Look  Ross  in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke.  Anyway  I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy"" "
Ross, Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Phoebe, I can't say  I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.
Ross," You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!"
Phoebe, Yeah… but you should know  I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Ross, Still… this is amazing… Oh my god  thank you  Phoebe.
Phoebe," You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him"
Ross, You're welcome.
Joey,"  ""I need an answer!"""
Joey," ""You know!"""
Joey," ""I need an answer now!"""
Joey,  Oh!
Joey," ""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you  I can never forgive myself  I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!"""
Joey,  Oh thanks  thanks! Now  I really have to get…
Monica, Wow  that's a big cable bill! Huh  you don't have a job  but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!
Ross,  Hey  uhm  Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…
Monica, … that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.
Ross, I see. You didn't happen to tell…
Monica, … everybody we know? Yeah.
Ross, Great. Thanks! 
Chandler, Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
Monica, I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Chandler, I'm not sure what they did  but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
Monica, I guess with you doing the internship  we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Chandler, Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
Monica, Oh  But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Chandler, You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
Monica, Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Chandler, No! We're not borrowing money.
Monica, Why not?
Chandler, Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
Monica, Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Chandler, That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
Phoebe, Why??
Phoebe, Oh...you don't have to go  I have something that will fit you.
Phoebe, I want you to stay.
Phoebe, Why don't you turn them inside ou...
Phoebe, I'll miss you.
Phoebe, Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Phoebe," Wow  Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell yeah!"""
Phoebe, Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god  we're really going to move in together!
Phoebe," I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!"
Monica, Hey Joey!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you  will never get back to Chandler.
Joey, I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend  it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Monica,  Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.
Joey, Aww  I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Monica, But Chandler lent you money!
Joey, And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Monica, Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.
Joey, Oh...how much?
Monica, Two thousand dollars?
Joey, Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Monica, Yeah...
Joey, That's right I am! 
Rachel, Hi you guys!
Joey, Oo...what's in the bag?
Rachel, Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place  is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
Joey," Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know  when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!"
Monica, Anyway erm  are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
Rachel, No. I was just going to do this myself. 
Joey, You're gonna do it?
Rachel, Yeah  Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Joey, Oh  women can. You can't.
Rachel, Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Monica, You're a pig. And you can't do this.
Rachel, Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Joey, The hardware store is right down the street.
Rachel, There is a hardware store right down the street?
Phoebe, Hey you guys! Ok  we've got great news.
Phoebe, I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.
Monica," Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like"" "
Chandler, Yeah.... she's not so cute.
Phoebe, Okay  well you put down the toilet seat.
Monica, Is that a bit you guys do?
Phoebe, Uh huh...we're playing you two.
Monica, We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
Chandler, Yes dear.
Ross, I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's  that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Monica, I hear wedding bells.
Phoebe, Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean  I don't know  Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.
Ross, Phoebe  I had no idea you were so conventional.
Phoebe, I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!
Phoebe, Yeah! You bet roomy!
Monica, Don't you mean..groomy?
Phoebe, Oh please  these guys  we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns. 
Phoebe, China patterns!!!!!
Rachel, This is easy...Can't do this!  Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this. 
Chandler, Hey Joe!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
Joey, I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Chandler, And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Joey, Yeah  I know.
Chandler, What? What do you mean you know?
Joey, Err... I just figured it out! You know  I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Chandler, Oh! Right.
Joey,  That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Chandler, Anyway  err... I need to borrow some money.
Joey, Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Chandler, Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that! 
Joey, Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is. 
Chandler, Oh ok.
Joey,  I am on fire!
Joey, Err... Kind of.
Chandler, I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
Joey, Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems  it was for something for her.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Something personal.
Chandler, What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
Joey, Boob job.
Monica, I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Joey, Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller  that would be crazy.
Phoebe, Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
Phoebe, Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
Phoebe, What do you mean?
Phoebe, Oh. Wow.
Phoebe, Was it really that bad?
Phoebe, Ok  well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
Phoebe, But it's just...
Phoebe, Oh!
Phoebe, No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
Phoebe, Yeah I get that.
Rachel, Hi!
Monica, So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Rachel, Yeah  I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.
Rachel, Oh thank you so much.  Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game. 
Chandler, Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Rachel, Don't look at me I never get his jokes.
Monica, Thank you?
Chandler, Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Monica, Ok  you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?
Chandler, No no! I just love the way you look  I am warm  for your form.
Monica, Ok..You know the old classics you know You look nice? They're still ok.
Chandler, Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically  I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
Monica, Okay...
Chandler, I mean  You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
Rachel, Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.
Monica, I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
Rachel, I don't know! I mean  what brought that on?
Monica, Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Rachel, No you really think that's what it is?
Monica," You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler."
Rachel, Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger  your ass is gonna get bigger  you're gonna lose bladder control.  God! It's just such a magical time!
Phoebe, Hi
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Listen  I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Ross, Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
Phoebe, No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.
Ross, Why?
Phoebe, Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.
Ross, Never?
Phoebe, Never.
Ross, wow  are you still going to move in with him?
Phoebe, I want to  but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't  I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!
Ross, Yeah  marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Phoebe, That's not how you really feel is it?
Ross, No  I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Phoebe, Seriously? You divorce-o?
Ross," If you have to call me name  I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look  I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry."
Phoebe, It's ok that's how you feel.
Ross, But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Phoebe, I do love Mike.
Ross, Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before  and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
Phoebe, Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.
Ross, The Divorcer  to the rescue!
Phoebe, It's not cooler.
Ross, Yeah I just hurt it.
Joey, Rach?!  Rachel!!!!?  So I can't do anything I like????
Chandler, Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
Monica, Honey?
Chandler, Yeah?
Monica, About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Chandler, But honey you don't have to.
Monica, I'm going to get bigger!
Chandler, Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
Rachel, Argh. fascist
Monica, Well  my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Chandler, your ass?!?!?
Rachel, Man  don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Chandler, They...do that?
Monica, It's kind of a package deal!
Chandler, God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
Monica, I thought I was something that we both wanted!
Chandler, Alright look  if it means that much to you  a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Rachel, Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this  what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Chandler,  What?
Rachel, Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?
Joey, Because she is!
Monica, Joey  Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
Joey, Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
Joey, OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Ross," Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross: The Divorce-Force""."
Phoebe, Better.
Ross, Hey Pheebs  you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.
Phoebe, Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah  no  thanks you.
Ross, Good  good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it  the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.
Phoebe, What do you mean?
Ross, Well  I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
Phoebe, They are awfully boxy...
Ross, I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.
Phoebe, Uh huh.
Ross, Hey hey  can I help?
Chandler, Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs  manueveored a narrow hallway  dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Ross, You know sometimes your words... they hurt.
Joey, Hey uh  where do you guys want this?
Rachel, Yeah  seriously coz this is really heavy.  I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this  but for these guys.
Phoebe, Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Phoebe, Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Joey,  Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Phoebe, Someday.
Chandler, Aaaaand....... hernia.
Phoebe, I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
Phoebe, Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you  and I wanted to live with you.
Phoebe, But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen  but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Phoebe, Are you gonna change yours?
Phoebe, Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Phoebe, I don't want it to end either.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Monica, We're all sorry... 
Chandler, Ah  look on the bright side  I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you. 
Joey, AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
Chandler, Hey! Ready to go?
Ross, Oh yeah  let me just finish this.
Joey, Hey Ross  check this out!  yeah  I can't do that!
Chandler, What are you doin'?
Ross, Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people  let everyone know what you're up to.
Chandler, Great  a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .
Ross, It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Chandler, The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
Ross, Uh uh... well  her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Chandler, Bet she'd sleep with you now...
Ross, No... I already e-mailed her.
Chandler," Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology  two kids... ""  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!"
Ross, You know what? I'm gonna finish this later  ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Joey, Hey! 
Ross,  What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes?? 
Chandler," Maybe we finish this for him!  ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!"
Joey,  No  no  no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Ross,  Alright  let's go!
Joey, Dude! 
Ross, I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
Joey,  aaand SEND! 
Rachel, Hey! How was basketball?
Joey, Oh  it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
Rachel, Oh  no! Who did that?
Joey, Chandler... hey...  Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma? 
Rachel, She was just crawling around and she found him  so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
Joey,  Oh  yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Rachel, Joey... are you sure? I mean  I know how much you love him!
Joey, Rachel... let's be clear on this  ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Rachel, All right... Oh  Emma loves him!
Joey, Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Phoebe, Hi.
Monica, Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Phoebe, Breaking up sucks! Oh  I really miss Mike!
Chandler, Oh  I'm so sorry!
Phoebe, Oh God  I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica  I really need your help getting through this...
Chandler, You're not gonna need my help?
Phoebe, Well no  when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
Chandler, Oh good  'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth 
Phoebe, Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know  Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
Monica, Ok  you got it!
Phoebe,  Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know  there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
Monica, Really? If that's what you want...
Phoebe, That was a test and you just failed.
Monica, Damn it! Rookie mistake!
Ross,  I have sex with dinosaurs??
Chandler, I believe I read that somewhere!
Ross, That only is not funny  it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!
Chandler, I respectfully disagree.
Ross, I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Chandler, Who cares? Nobody reads those things
Ross, You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Chandler, I don't have a page.
Ross, Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
Joey, Look at you  all sweet and innocent  sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.  It's okay  Emma  you stay asleep. 
Rachel, : Step away from the crib  I have a weapon!
Joey, It's okay  it's okay Rach  it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
Rachel, What are you doing?
Joey, Well  I heard Emma stirring  so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
Rachel, Oh  oh thanks. Alright well  now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
Joey,  There you go sweetie...  This isn't over.
Monica," Alright  wait a second  why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  ""gay as the day is long""?"
Chandler, Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Monica, But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true. 
Chandler, Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Monica,  Hello? No  he's not here. Yeah  this is his wife. Yeah  well  it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah  I mean  he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Chandler, Hang up  hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah  this will show him  here we go .
Monica, What are you doing?
Chandler, Oh  you'll see my friend.
Ross,  I'm dead?
Chandler,  And so young.
Ross, Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Chandler, Well  how you died was funny.
Ross, Oh please  hit by a blimp?
Chandler, It kills over one americans every year.
Ross, Unbelievable  my classmates are gonna think I'm dead  my professors  my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
Chandler, You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Ross, You've really crossed the line here  but that's okay  it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
Phoebe, God  I wish Mike were here.
Monica, Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Monica, What are you  animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Phoebe, I gotta call him. Just to talk to him  there's no harm in that.
Monica, Phoebe  that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake  I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver  or  okay  just a slice or two. And next thing you know  you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe  honey  I know this is hard. Look  if you talk to him  you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him  you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.
Phoebe, Here.
Monica, And now your cell.
Phoebe, Okay 
Monica, This is your cellphone?
Phoebe, Yes.
Monica, This is your current cellphone?
Phoebe, Yes  it reminds me of a simpler time.
Monica, Phoebe  where's your purse?
Monica, No  no! Give it to me!
Phoebe, You can't have it.
Monica, Give it to me!
Phoebe, No 
Monica, I'll go in there.
Phoebe,  Oh yeah.
Monica, Phoebe come here
Monica, Haha!
Phoebe, Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Joey, Hey  look who's here! It's Joey  and he brought home a friend.
Rachel, Joey  Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Joey, No  no  it's not a girl  it's... a brand new Hugsy!
Rachel, Oh that's so great  now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Joey, No  no  Emma has one Hugsy  the new Hugsy  huh? The other Hugsy  I don't know  I guess I'll just take it back.
Rachel, Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much  I took her everywhere  I would braid her tail...
Joey, Make the transfer! 
Rachel, Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Joey, Oh  no don't worry about that  I swallowed that years ago.
Rachel, Oh  I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Joey, But he's the same.
Rachel, Yeah  I think she wants the old one back.
Joey, But he's the same.
Rachel, Joey  come on!
Joey, He's the same!
Joey,  You're not the same!
Monica, Haha!
Phoebe, You know  it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Monica, So Phoebe  why are there men's shoes by the door.
Phoebe, Those are my shoes.
Monica, Oh  when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
Phoebe, Monica  I really appreciate you checking in on me  but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah  I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Monica, Who's that? 
Phoebe, I ordered Chinese food.
Phoebe, What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Monica,  What are you doing here?
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, I'm sorry  I broke down... I wanted to see him.
Monica, Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Phoebe, There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Monica, Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
Monica,  This doesn't concern you!!
Monica, Look  guys  you can't do this  it's just going to make getting over each other  that much harder.
Phoebe, Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
Monica, Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends  then maybe I'll join ya. You know  I'm your friend  and Mike's friend .
Phoebe, Sit down.
Monica, Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend! 
Monica, I've been pretty good!
Phoebe, Thanks  you look good too.
Monica, Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
Phoebe, So how's the piano playing going?
Phoebe, I've missed you too.
Monica, You know  on the way over here  I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
Chandler, Hey  Ross  I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
Ross, uhu uhu  check this out. 
Chandler, Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
Ross," Eh..actually no  I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work  ok  there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website  nobody called my parents  so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called  nobody wrote anything  nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?"
Chandler, No  come on  you know that's not true.
Ross, What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Chandler, Well  the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
Ross, I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy! 
Chandler, Alright look  let's think about this  ok  do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
Ross, You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Chandler, Right  I mean  come on  I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service  tons of people would come.
Ross, Exactly!! 
Chandler, Ross  what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
Ross, No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Chandler, Ross  don't press send  don't press se... !
Ross, oh  too late  too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Rachel, I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap  have you seen Hugsy?
Joey, Original or crappy?
Rachel, Original.
Joey, No  sorry haven't seen him.
Rachel, Then what's that big lump under your covers?
Joey, It's Monica  ok?
Rachel, That's not Monica!
Joey, Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No  now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
Rachel,  Oh God.
Joey, ... she's being unreasonable!
Rachel,  Joey  there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much  Oh don't cover its ears!  It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
Joey, It does?
Rachel, Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Joey, Really? She... she loves me?
Rachel, Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy  don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .
Joey, Ok  wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute  I mean Rach  I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Rachel, Oooh... you're sweet  I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma  look who's baaack!
Joey, Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Rachel, Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
Joey, How do you think I got him in the first place?
Monica, Alright you two  I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus  fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
Phoebe, I know  I want that too  but IS that going to make it too hard?
Monica,  Kiss him  you fool!!
Phoebe, What?
Monica, Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
Phoebe, Oh  I missed you so much! 
Phoebe, Who is this?
Monica, Hi  that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
Monica, Excuse me?
Monica, Hey  at least I knew where my guy was.
Monica, You didn't hear the speech!
Monica, Hey  it was very moving! You're just heartless!
Monica, You're... weird!
Monica, Oh !
Monica, Damn it!
Monica, And I blame you too.
Ross, It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you  when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
Chandler, There you go! Someone came!
Ross, Ok  ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh  this is so exciting  my first mourner! 
Monica, Hi  glad you could come.
Chandler,  Please  come in.
Chandler, Oh yes  yes... let me... take your coat.
Chandler, At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps 
Ross, Who is he?
Chandler, Some guy  Tom Gordon.
Ross, I don't remember him  but then again I touched so many lives. 
Monica, So  did you know Ross well?
Monica,  Yes  he is. Me.
Chandler,  Ok Tommy  that's enough mourning for you! Here we go  bye bye!! 
Chandler, Ok! 
Ross,  I'm dead and no one cares?
Monica, I look like a man??
Chandler, Please  one ridiculous problem at a time!
Ross, It isn't ridiculous  look around! No one's here!
Chandler, You gave them one day's notice  not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
Ross, Yes  you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean  I went to that school for 4 years  I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Chandler, Oh  that's not true. You had an impact on me  I mean  it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Ross,  Yeah...
Chandler, I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now  go hide. 
Chandler, Kori? Kori Weston?
Chandler, Wow! You look amazing!
Chandler, Chandler  Chandler Bing. I'm not gay  I'm not gay at all.
Monica, You are married though.
Chandler, Don't listen to him  he's in a really bad mood! 
Chandler, I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Chandler, I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door  I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Ross,  But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori  I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean  the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
Ross, Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ross,  No Mum  I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me  but it's over  ok?  Actually no  even if I had died  you would not be left childless.  Monica?
Joey, Monica  hey  can I borrow the Porsche?
Monica, Ok.
Joey, Alright!
Monica, But ehm...what is it not?
Joey,  A place to entertain my lady friends.
Monica, And what else is it not?
Joey,  A place to eat spaghetti.
Monica, Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?
Joey, Oh well  the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York  so...
Rachel, Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Joey, Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Monica, Hey  maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Joey, Uh!
Monica, Yeah with Chandler not getting paid  we could really use 300 million dollars.
Chandler, Yeah  because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Phoebe, Hey will you get me tickets too?
Rachel, Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks  we'll pool our money together and then if we win  we'll split it!
Ross, No thanks!
Phoebe, You don't wanna win the lottery?
Ross, Uh...sure I do  and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Chandler, Still on Amelia Earhart?
Ross, The woman just vanished!
Joey, Seriously  Ross  you don't want in on this?
Ross, No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Chandler, Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Joey, I like those odds!
Ross, Seriously you guys  I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery  I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Chandler, I'll ask.  Boohaki?
Ross, Oh oh  we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Rachel, Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki  goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Monica, How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Rachel, Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
Chandler, Kinda like Joey.
Joey, What's that now?
Monica, God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
Chandler, Pie eating contest?
Monica, Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
Chandler, No  I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Monica, That was a good day!
Ross, They're towing your car  they're towing your car!!
Monica, I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
Ross, They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Joey, Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma!  Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Rachel, Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
Joey, I was?
Joey, I did?
Rachel, She dropped off a casserole?
Joey, Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Monica, So  did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Ross, Yeah  uh... and then I figured after you win  we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
Chandler, Don't touch the phone! I'll get it  I'll get it  I'll get it!! 
Ross, Think he washed his hands?
Chandler, Hello? Hey Charlie  what do you know?
Rachel, What's going on?
Monica, Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns  they are only hiring three.
Joey, Ooh! Tough odds!
Ross, Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Joey, Look who's coming around!
Chandler, Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Joey, Did you get it?
Chandler, One of the slots got filled.
Joey, By you!?
Chandler, Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Monica, Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
Chandler, Yeah I know.
Rachel, Well  there's two spots left right?
Chandler, Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean  I wanna get one  I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
Phoebe, Hey you guys! Ok  you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
Monica, Hey that reminds me  I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
Ross, A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Monica, Alright  who wants to do it?
Phoebe, Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know  just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Monica, Ok  hey Rach?
Rachel, Oh no  I'm good  I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Joey, I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Phoebe, I hope I win!
Monica, Well  it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing  right?
Joey, I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Monica," Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!"
Joey, Can't really say!
Monica, I understand  but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for  aren't you?
Joey, I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Phoebe, One  two  three!
Joey, I won  hey!
Ross, You know what  I'm sure your wish is gonna come true  but  you guys - just in case  maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Rachel, You know  Ross  just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Ross, Uh  you're not gonna win.
Rachel," Oh  I know  I know  the odds are against us  but somebody has to win  and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know  we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody  let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh  I can't guys  I'll meet you guys up there  I gotta gas up the Hyundai"""
Ross, Ok  I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Chandler," I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
Ross, Why would I eat my own arm?
Chandler, Well you wouldn't  but we own the paper  we can print whatever we want.
Monica, You know what  Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
Ross, Why?
Monica," Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother  and I want you to be a part of this."
Ross, You don't have to do that  I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here 
Phoebe, Get a room!
Chandler, Ok  so now that you're in  what are you gonna do if we win?
Ross, I don't know  probably just invest it.
Chandler, Ooh! Calm down ...
Joey, Seriously  that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Ross," Oh  I'm sorry  did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away"" "
Joey, Ooh  ooh  I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Rachel, I don't really care about the Knicks.
Joey, Oh  you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Rachel,  You would do that? I never get picked!
Chandler, You know  I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
Joey, You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
Chandler, You're right  it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Ross,  Uh  how long until they announce the numbers  Mommy?
Chandler,  I'll take this one too  Uh ... Mommy?
Ross," Oh  I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ..."
Rachel, I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
Ross," Although if we're gonna do that  we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too."
Phoebe," Oooh  I like that  ""daddy"" "
Ross, I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Phoebe,  Oooh  is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Ross,  Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi ..  no I can't.
Chandler, Hello? Hello? Oh  hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man  I would have slept with him!! .. Alright  bye. 
Joey, Dude  I'm sorry. But hey  there's one spot left  right?
Chandler, Well no  Charlie's gonna get that.
Monica, Hey  don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
Chandler, He's the boss's son.
Monica, Come on  lottery!! 
Rachel, Ooh  you guys  it starts in like 20 minutes.
Monica, Ok  here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok  how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40  and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
Rachel, Ooh  I have another idea!
Monica, I'm sorry  idea time is over.
Phoebe, Ok  well  are all the tickets in the bowl?
Monica, Yeah.
Chandler, What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
Monica, There are no tickets on the nightstand!
Chandler, Yes there are  I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Monica, Un  no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
Chandler, Honey  there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
Monica, Chandler  sense the tone!!
Rachel, Well  well  well  look what mommy found!!
Monica, Ok  fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
Phoebe, Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Ross, I can't believe this  I thought we were all in this together!
Monica, Hey  you just got in 5 minutes ago!
Ross, 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Joey, I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut  when did you even get those?
Monica, When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
Joey,  I'll show you how.
Rachel," Ok  well Monica  suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?"
Monica, Please ... if I win the lottery  you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
Rachel, Chandler  would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Chandler,  She's right  you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Monica, Ahhh! 
Chandler, Let me finish ...  however  it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles  so screw you  the tickets are ours!! 
Monica, There's the man I married!!
Rachel, All right  believe me.If you win the lottery  it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Monica, Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah  and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
Rachel,  OH! Alright  you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
Joey, Yeah  I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff  ah ah!
Ross, Than I want mine  too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Phoebe, Oh  you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together 
Monica, No  no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
Joey, Hey  if anybody gets extra tickets  it should be me! This all thing was my idea! 
Chandler, Oh  yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Rachel, Ok  that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! 
Joey,  Oh!
Phoebe,  OOOOOHHHHH!
Ross,  Hey  hey!!
Phoebe,  OOOOOHHHHH!  Fine  I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! 
Rachel, Oh  if she jumps  I get her tickets.
Joey, No  no! 
Phoebe, If we are not doing it together  we're not doing it at all! So  say goodbye to your tickets! .
Phoebe, Don't come any closer!
Chandler, Can I come a little bit closer  valuable things are getting squished...
Phoebe, No  what's more important  your friends or money?
Monica, Money!  Friends...
Phoebe, Hey Monica  what about your extra tickets?
Monica, They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...
Ross, Monica!
Phoebe, Ok  good!  You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God  no!  I think I broke your bowl.
Ross, Go  go  go!!
Phoebe, What a beautiful night to be running around the street  looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
Monica, Phoebe  we lost half of them.
Phoebe, So  what? Monica  we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win  remember?
Ross, Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
Phoebe, As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So  excuse me for being a little skittish.
Chandler,  Hey  there's two messages. These could be from work!
Monica, Oh  play them!
Chandler, Ok  here we go! 
Phoebe, Well  I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Chandler, This is..shhh!
Monica, Oh God  I am so sorry honey...
Rachel, Oh  it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
Chandler, Oh  is she related to Ralph Lauren?
Rachel, No  she was just much better at job than me!
Phoebe, Guys  the drawing is about to start!
Rachel,  You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Ross, Oh yeah  it's a good idea!
Monica,  Honey  you've been really strong about this  I know how badly you wanted that job.
Chandler, Yeah  you know  I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean  we still have 130 chances to win  right?
Monica,  131! 
Ross,  Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember  you're daddy's little girl...  Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... 
Rachel, Hi mum  put her back on!
Joey,  Rach  come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God  I can already feel myself changing.
Chandler, I got that!
Ross, Oh  we have one too!!
Monica, We are on a roll  people!!
Ross,  Come on!!
Rachel,  Mum  please!I know you love your new lips  but I can barely understand you! Would you  please  just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
Monica, Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Rachel,  Guys  you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
Joey, And what did she say?
Rachel," She said ""gleba""!! "
Monica, Make me rich!!
Rachel,  Isn't that amazing?
Ross, Oh yeah  no no no...that's great!
Rachel, Why-why aren't you more excited?
Ross," Oh  Rach...oh...""gleba"" is not a word."
Rachel, Oh  but of course it is!
Ross, Okay  what does it mean?
Rachel, I don't know all the words.
Ross, I'm just  I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
Ross, Yes you did  gleba is a word!
Ross, Ok  use it in a sentence.
Rachel," Ok... ""Emma just said gleba""!"
Ross, It's not a word!
Rachel, Okay  okay  okay  fine  I'm gonna look it up .
Ross, Oh  oh  ok  great. You know what  while you're at it she said another word the other day  why don't you  why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Rachel,  Alright  okay  okay  gleba  gleba...  Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy  spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
Ross, She's gonna be a scientist! 
Joey,  Damnit! anybody got anything?
Chandler, No.
Phoebe, I'm still looking through mine...
Monica, Just double checking ...no  no  no... No!
Monica,  Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
Chandler," Ah  the ""I'm sorry I rejected you"" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey  Steve."
Chandler, Oh no no no no  I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones  getting coffee  I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts  boobies  butt cracks!
Chandler, Me  that guy who just said butt cracks?
Chandler, Ok well  thanks  you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
Chandler, What?  Oh  yeah  I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Monica, Oh sweetie  I'm so proud of you!
Chandler, Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Monica, You bet! No TV or anything! 
Joey,  Hey  that is so great about the job.
Chandler, Thanks  man.
Joey, And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Chandler, Really? What?
Joey, Well  before  with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery  I wished you'd get the job.
Chandler,  Oh yeah?  Listen  don't tell Monica  she'll rip your heart right out.
Joey, Oh yeah.
Rachel, You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Ross, Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
Phoebe, You guys  what was the Powerball number again?
Phoebe, We won.
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, We won!
Monica, Let me see!
Phoebe, Don't tear it.
Ross, Phoebe  you don't have any of the first five numbers.
Phoebe, I know that  but look  we've got the Powerball number  we've won 3 dollars!
Chandler, Wow  you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
Phoebe,  I don't care  I've never won anything before  I can't believe this!
Rachel, So Pheebs  what are you going to do with your $3?
Phoebe, It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
Monica, You know what? You can have mine.
Chandler, Me too.
Joey, Me too.
Rachel, Me too.
Ross, I guess if everybody else is...
Joey,  Hey guys  so I just called the Powerball hotline  can you believe it? Nobody won.
Phoebe, I beg to differ .
Phoebe,  Coo  again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me  the pigeon  coo!  Seriously  stop staring at her.
Joey,  God  you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
Joey, I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
Rachel, I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything  but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
Joey, Oh  ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous  you know  I really want it to be good!
Rachel, Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
Joey, Yeah  that was a disappointment... Oh  hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
Rachel,  Are you serious?
Joey, Yeah!Hey  you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
Rachel, Hey  that was an honest mistake!
Joey," Right!""Oh my God  is this the men's room? Oh  I feel so foolish  have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"" "
Rachel, Yeah  that was an awesome day!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hi!
Monica, So  do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
Phoebe, Sure!
Ross, I'd love to!
Monica, Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!
Phoebe, Well  I can't give you a massage  because my licence has been revoked again!
Ross, Phoebe  what happened?
Phoebe, Well  it was an accident...You know  it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
Chandler,  Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
Phoebe, Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Chandler, What? No  I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Phoebe, Oh  good!Ok  good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
Chandler, So  what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Monica, Oh  honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!
Chandler, Are you really that busy?
Monica, Yeah  I'm sorry. I really am.
Chandler," Oh  that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  ""Hi  this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it  Oh  what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time?  Oh  can't you make an exception?"""
Monica, Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!
Phoebe, And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Chandler,"  ""Look  this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?""  ""Oh  thank you very much!""  Yeah  I'm going to Vermont..."
Ross, Oh  don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
Chandler, I don't have travel insurance.
Ross, Well  this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Monica, Why don't you take Ross?
Ross, Uh  don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean  two guys in a romantic inn...
Monica, No  not if their room has two beds!
Ross,  I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
Rachel, Hey Joey  is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
Joey, I don't know  but one of the extras sure did!  Hey  listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Rachel, Oh  please!Honey  just the fact that you want me here to support you  I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!
Joey, Also so gay!
Rachel," Oh  in my head he's done some pretty ""not-gay-stuff""!"
Joey, Well  at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
Joey, Oh  wish me luck!
Rachel, Ok  not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight  right?
Joey, Rach  I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Rachel, Oh  I'm sorry  you're right.I'm sorry  good luck! 
Rachel,  OH!
Rachel, SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!
Rachel, NO!  Or  cut!You know  that's your call!
Monica, Thank you!
Monica, Thank you! You haven't said anything...
Monica, Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
Monica, What musician?
Phoebe,  And there's a country called Argentinaaaa  it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!
Monica, What are you doing here!
Phoebe, Well  you said that you had customers lined up in the street  so I am here to entertain!
Monica, Great!
Phoebe," Yeah! It really has been great too  you know  some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah  ""You suck"" and ""shut up and go home""."
Monica, Listen Phoebe...
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, You know how much I love listening to your music  you know  but...
Phoebe, But what?
Monica, This is kind of a classy place.
Phoebe,  Ok  say no more.
Phoebe, : It wasn't just that she was fat  the woman smelled like garbage! Everyone! It wasn't just that she was fat the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage!  Classy  uh?
Chandler, Hi  Chandler Bing  I have a reservation.
Chandler, New York.
Ross,  The big apple!
Chandler, I'm sorry  he's a little bit wound up  we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
Ross, Yeah  I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Chandler, Well  that's impossible  can you check again  please?
Ross,  Check again please!
Ross, Not there.
Chandler, Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable  then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
Ross,  She doesn't know what to say!
Chandler, Just give us the cheapest room you have.
Chandler, That's insane!
Ross, Totally insane. Dude  let's drive home  we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Chandler, Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.
Chandler,  What!? They are totally ripping us off!
Ross, Dude  don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel  you know  plenty of amenities  we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one  I'm... I take six!
Chandler, Great  at a hundred dollars an apple  we're there!
Ross, C'mon  you get the idea  ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Chandler, Dude  you're shaking!
Ross, I think it's the sugar  could you hold the apple?
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Joey  I gotta tell ya  I've been thinking all day about that scene you did  I mean  you were amazing!
Joey, Oh  you know  the writing was good  and the director is good  and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
Rachel, God  you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Joey, Ow  I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Rachel, Me? Oh  no  I am not an actress.
Joey, Oh  all right  I can ask Monica.
Rachel, Oh screw her  that part is mine!
Joey, Right...  ok  so just from the top of the page  right here.
Rachel, Okay. . Hello Drake  I'm surprised to see you here.
Rachel,  Kiss me.
Joey, What?
Rachel, Kiss me.
Joey, Ah  Rach  it doesn't say that!
Rachel, No  I'm saying...
Joey, but  but..
Rachel, just... don't talk... 
Rachel,  Ehhh  aw! . Well  that's new!
Ross,  Hi  this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush  toothpaste  razor  mouthwash  deodorant  dental floss  band aids  shaving cream  after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah  go ahead  send up some tampons.
Ross, What did you get?
Chandler, USA Today
Ross, Nice  put it with the others.
Chandler, And I also got... two more apples.
Ross, We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive  I love being in the country!
Chandler, I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ross, Oh  that's not cool.
Ross, No  Chandler  you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier  no  no  no  but shampoo and conditioners  yes  yes  yes.  Now  the salt shaker is off-limits  but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.
Chandler, I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's  but the bulbs ...oh  you already got that.
Ross, Not my first time in a hotel  my friend.
Chandler, Ok  how about this ?
Ross, No  no  no  you can't take the remote control!
Chandler, Yes  but the batteries...
Chandler, Thank you  thank you very much!
Ross, Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
Chandler, No!
Ross, At least tell me where you hid it.
Rachel, Can I ask you a question?
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
Monica, Let me think. Oh  when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese  and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Rachel, Ok  well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
Monica, Wow  do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Rachel, Oh yeah! I mean  that was pretty intense.
Monica, What do you think brought than on?
Rachel, I don't know! I mean  maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
Monica, A love scene? With who?
Rachel, Olivia.
Monica, Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right  real life more important.
Rachel, So do you think that my dream means anything?
Monica, I don't know. I mean  you saw him do a love scene  so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey  maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Rachel, Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Monica, Of course it was! Trust me  when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
Rachel, You took the same class twice.
Monica, It was hard!
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Here  Monica  look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh  huh wait!  Right? I mean  this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
Monica, Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Phoebe, Right  yeah  ok  I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Monica, Phoebe  it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Phoebe, Oh  ok. Fine  I'll just  I'll take the hat back .
Rachel, Hey  so you guys  the funniest thing happened  at work...
Phoebe, My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Rachel, Ok  we're still on that.
Monica, I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
Phoebe, Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
Monica, Tiny portions?
Phoebe," Yeah well  ""excuse me  I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer  but  I can't see it  I can't see it""!"
Monica, Phoebe  it's not about quantity.
Phoebe, Well...it's not about quality.
Monica, Oh really  you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
Phoebe, Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah  there are other ingredients Monica.
Monica, Ok  so that's what we're doing. You know  when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs  I'm wearing ear plugs.
Phoebe, Ear plugs  or cloves of garlic?
Monica, You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant  because with your music driving people inside  my bar sales are going up like crazy.
Phoebe, What are people having  the garlic Martini?
Chandler, Oh we did  and you still have all your lamps.
Chandler, Oh  I didn't factor in the room tax.
Ross, Oh dude  don't worry about it  I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Ross, Oh my god.
Chandler, What?
Ross, There's something new in the bowl.
Chandler, Look  we have enough  just walk away.
Ross, No  but I want...I want the pinecones!
Chandler, There's a forest right outside.
Ross, It's not the same.
Chandler, Ok  go quick!
Ross,  Thank you for a delightful stay.
Ross, Oh  my maple candy!
Phoebe,  Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
Monica, Thank god  it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Phoebe, You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica  the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
Monica, Ok  you have to stop playing now.
Phoebe, Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
Monica, Oh yeah? Ok  let's settle this  come on!
Phoebe,  Get your garlic-peelers off me!
Monica,  Excuse me  excuse me  hi  I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok  I was actually expecting a little applause there  but whatever! Ok  quick question: by a show of hands  how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? 
Phoebe, Ok  ok  how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!
Monica, Alright  let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine  but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Phoebe, Ok  well  who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
Monica, Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? 
Phoebe, Ok  well  alright  who thinks the food is fine  the music was fine  but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
Monica, Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? 
Phoebe, Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! 
Monica, I'm sorry...
Phoebe, I'm sorry too... 
Monica, ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Phoebe, Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
Phoebe,  Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Joey  do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Joey,  Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Rachel,  How...how...?
Joey, I was making a peanut butter smoothy  right?
Rachel, uh-huh
Joey, And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be  right...? Turns out very!
Rachel,  Wow...definitely just Drake...
Joey, What?
Rachel, What...how is it going with Drake?
Joey, Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Rachel, What...that scene I saw was so good!
Joey, Well  I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Rachel, Joey  is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
Joey, A little. Yeah no  I really am worried  you know  I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Rachel, So?
Joey, So...I've never played that!
Rachel, Ooh! Honey  it can't be that hard  I mean  you've been in love before?
Joey, Uh...well...just once...with you...
Rachel, Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
Joey,  What the hell are you talking about??
Rachel,  Alright  alright look  just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love  and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Joey,  Oh! ok  yeah  I think I can do that. Yeah ok  there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her  but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you  but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool  but really  it was killing me.
Rachel,  Joey  you never..you never talked about that before...
Joey, Well.. hey  you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom  and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there  but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up  when I would think to myself  my God  she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much  cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
Joey,  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! 
Chandler, I got you something from Vermont! 
Monica,  Besides tampons and salt?  Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you.  That's weird...it's empty!
Ross,  Hi you guys! what's going on  you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Joey,  Hey  you guys  what are you doing tomorrow night?
Chandler,  Well  let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes  falling asleep in front of the TV.
Joey, Look  my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
Chandler, I could fall asleep at a play.
Phoebe, What is it?
Joey," It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life""."
Monica, It sounds interesting!
Ross, Yeah  it does sound interesting  I mean  to listen to a woman complain for two hours  I don't think it gets bett... 
Phoebe, I know  I know  we can drive  we can vote  we can work  what more do these broads want?
Joey, You guys are gonna have a great time  I promise!
Ross, What? How come that you don't have to go!
Joey, I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day  so I can't go  but  you know  take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.
Chandler,  Uh  let's see  who do I hate?
Rachel,  Oh  sorry... Oops  sorry.
Joey,  Hey  here you go.
Rachel, Ooh... oooh...   oh  ah...   Can I ask you a question?
Monica, Yeah.
Rachel, Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
Monica, No  I don't think it ever works. Why?
Rachel, No reason.
Monica, No  no  Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah
Monica, Who do you wanna fool around with?
Rachel,  Nobody  forget it!
Rachel,  Maybe.
Monica,  You can't!
Rachel,  Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
Monica, In the hall.
Monica, You wanna fool around with Joey?
Rachel, Yeah! You know  ever since I had that dream about him  and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal  people do it all the time!
Monica, Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Rachel, Ok  off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Monica, Who  who are they?
Rachel, I know them from work.
Monica, Both of them?
Rachel, No  one of them...
Monica, Which one?
Rachel, I don't know  what were the names I just said?
Monica, Rachel  things can get incredibly complicated.
Rachel, All right  all right  you're right  I won't do anything with Joey  I just thought that we  Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon  one pound of baking soda and one red onion? 
Monica, What the hell are you cooking!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Hey  you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.
Chandler, Yes  but  Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Ross,   There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.
Monica, What's so bad about that?
Ross, It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.
Monica, : Ross?
Ross,  These aren't suede.
Ross, Hi  hi  I'm Ross Geller.
Ross, Oh  oh  that's  that's  that's nice.
Ross, Oh  no  it's no big deal  I mean  if I weren't doing this I'd just  you know  be at the gym working out.
Monica,  Is he gonna introduce us?
Chandler,  No  I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Ross, Oh  ha  I wrote that in one minute.
Monica,  Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Ross,   We should probably get going  you know  we got a lot of ground to cover.
Ross, I don't think so.
Ross," Oh  well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time  then don't come at all"".  An option that many of my students use.  Shall we?"
Ross, You know what  he's a big boy  I'm sure he'll find us  ok?
Ross, Oh  damn it!
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, What's happenin'?
Rachel, Yeah  it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Joey, Oh  I'd love to  but I gotta get up so early the next day and so  you know me  work comes first
Rachel, Oh  yeah  yeah  yeah... 
Joey,  Stupid Jane Rogers!!
Rachel,  You are having a party tonight??
Joey, Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Rachel, And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
Joey, I do it every year.
Rachel, You do that every year??
Joey, I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Rachel, Oh  that's why you got these tickets to that play  to get rid of us??
Joey, Yeah...
Rachel, And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Joey, Yeah...
Rachel, OH! And the year before that  when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Joey,  I can't believe you guys went for that one!
Rachel, Joey  why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
Joey, You're fine  ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Rachel, Well  then so you just invite me...!
Joey,  Please  I was trying to be nice  you're the worst one!
Rachel, Oh  Joey  come on! Please  please! Let me come  I will behave  I promise! I will behave! Please  please  please...
Joey, Ok  ok! Fine! You can come  but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Rachel,  OH  a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God  oh my God!!  And it's out of my system!
Ross,  So  where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Ross,  Oh  it's not over!
Ross, So basically all nuts?
Ross, I've lost the will to live.
Ross, What?
Ross, Oh... ok  fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you  ehm...  When we exit should we walk  or run  or prance  or stroll...
Ross,  Oh  hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie  this is Phoebe and my sister  Monica.
Phoebe, Hi!
Ross, Yeah  Charlie is gonna be joining my department.
Phoebe, Oh  you're a paleonthologist  too!  Oh  ok  now  what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Phoebe, Ah  ah.
Ross,  Ranion's theory of species variegation?
Phoebe, Yeah  I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Monica,  So  did you two have fun?
Ross, Oh my God  she's great! I mean  we-we have so much in common and she's just cool  and funny...
Monica, And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HOTTY!!  HI!
Rachel,  Hey... Hi you guys! Listen  you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Ross, Really? Wh-what's wrong?
Rachel, I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh  you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Rachel, ... Ok  who is this?
Ross, I'm sorry  Rachel  this is Charlie Wealer  she's a collegue.
Rachel, Oh  hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
Monica, Hey  Rachel  Can-can I see you for a sec?
Rachel, Sure!  Oh...
Monica, You're not sick!
Rachel, What? Yes  I am!
Monica, Ok  then  why are you...  all dressed up??
Rachel, When you're sick  you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! 
Monica, You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Rachel, Oh  no  no! I heard you before  that is so not what this is!
Monica, Ok  what is this?
Rachel, Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Monica,  WHAT?
Ross,  Wh-what's going on?
Monica, Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Rachel, And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Rachel, Ok professor or detective?
Phoebe, Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Rachel, Yeah  and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Phoebe, And that horrible museum tour!
Ross, No  I arranged that...
Joey,  Hey you guys  I'm turning in. Have fun.
Phoebe, We know about your party Joey.
Joey, What party?
Monica, The game's over! Take off your robe!
Joey,  Ok... I mean...
Joey,  Nice to meet ya! 
Joey,  Hey! Hey alright! Hey  glad you could make it  Thanks for coming.
Monica, Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Monica,  I love you!
Joey, Hey  that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down  alright... go  go get yourself a drink or something...
Monica, Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica,  Oh my God  can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Phoebe, Monica  you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? 
Monica,  Oh my God! Chandler!
Chandler, Where the hell is everybody?
Monica,"  Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one  then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love""."
Rachel, Ok actually Mon  Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Monica, Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!
Rachel, Nice to meet you.
Rachel, Ok
Monica,  We will!!
Monica,  Look at you with all the guys!
Rachel, Yeah!
Monica, I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Rachel, Yeah  well  I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Monica, Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! 
Ross,  So  eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston  huh?
Ross, Ooh... so sad... Still  it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross, You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Ross, ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Ross, Eh  you think? I mean  you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Ross,"  Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry  I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood""."
Ross, Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Ross,  Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Ross, Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Ross, Oh yeah? no  no Nobel Prizes for him?
Ross, Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? 
Phoebe, Hey Ross!
Ross,  Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Phoebe, Oh  What's the matter?
Ross, She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God  at the chinese restaurant earlier today  I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
Rachel, I always loved that!!
Ross, Of course you would  your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man  I can't compete with the guys she goes out with  they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Phoebe, Worse?
Ross," Oh much  much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  ""Can we walk""?  Oh  you... you like that?"
Phoebe,  No. 
Ross, What? 
Rachel, Come on! I think this is funny! 
Chandler,  oh yes  God yes!!
Chandler, I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Joey, Hey Ross  this is one of my co-stars  Dirk.  Dirk  this is my good friend Ross. 
Ross, Nice to meet you.
Ross, Oh  I'm no actor  I'm a professor of palaeontology.
Joey, It's a science.
Joey, Hey Ross  listen  Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together  or...
Ross, Oh  well no  but I mean  she only goes out with really  really smart guys.
Ross, I'd lead with that.
Monica, That's it  just sign right on the bra .
Joey, Monica!
Monica, Don't worry Joe  I won't come next year!
Joey,  What have you got there?
Ross, Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Joey, Ah  let me see!  Damn  that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?
Rachel,  I think I am.
Joey,  Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult  ok  and it costs you 5 000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.
Joey,  Pass  pass  oh  pass  double-pass  pass...
Rachel,  Why  why  what's wrong with these guys?
Joey, Nothing major  it's just that  you know  they're not really good enough for you  and you deserve the best.
Rachel, Joey  you're so sweet.
Joey, That's true. But you know what  it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.
Rachel, Who ?
Joey, Me.
Rachel,  What?  Really?
Joey, Yes  'cause we live together  that's a joke!
Rachel, Oh! Screw it  I didn't get it! 
Joey, Gotcha.
Rachel, Oh  Very funny... Joey.
Chandler,  So  how did you enjoy the play?
Monica, Oh my god  honey  I'm so so so so so sorry.
Chandler, Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Monica, You really liked it?
Chandler," Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it  but why wouldn't I  because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: ""fat  single and ready to mingle""  I was uplifted."
Monica, Oh really!
Chandler, Oh yeah  I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me  tell me about your first period!
Monica, No!
Chandler, Did somebody sign your bra?
Monica, So I got it when I was 13...
Phoebe, Hey Ross! So listen  about you and the dinosaur girl  are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that  come on  a piece of paper?
Ross, It's actually a 1 000 000$ prize.
Phoebe, Go Charlie! But my point is  ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to  you know  slum it with some average Joe Phd.
Ross, Yeah  maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean  I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Phoebe, You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet  and kind  and funny...
Ross, And sexy.
Phoebe, Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!
Ross, Yeah  you're right  thanks Pheebs  I'm gonna go find her.
Phoebe, Good for you! And hey  I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!
Ross, Stop going through my stuff !
Rachel,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Rachel, I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it  I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Monica, No  you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Rachel, Please  what about you and Chandler?
Monica, That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Rachel, Well hello !
Monica, What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
Rachel, I could  I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Monica, Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Rachel,  I'm gonna do it.
Monica, And I can't stop you.
Rachel, No.
Ross,  Hey Rach  have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Ross, I'm smarter than him!
Phoebe, Hey  thank you so much for these tickets  Chandler.
Chandler, Oh well  this was a really important experience for me  and I wanted to share it with you.
Monica, Oh  you're so wonderful.
Chandler, Can't believe you guys bought that  enjoy your slow death .
Monica, It's so weird  how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
Ross, Hey  I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Chandler, I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl  right?
Ross, Yes  she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
Rachel, I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean  of all the girls at the party  GOD!
Ross, Why do you care so much?
Monica, Yes Rachel  why do you care so much?
Rachel,  Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women!  I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Ross, Oh  I don't know  they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Phoebe, Wow  Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh  those nerds will get laaaaaid!
Rachel, All right  so... Ross  you're ok with all this? I mean...
Ross, Yeah  it's no big deal. I mean  I just met her and I'm fine with it...
Ross, Oh  God. I forgot how hot she was!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, I'm gonna get some more coffee.
Ross, Ok. 
Chandler,  So  a professor  uh?
Joey, Yeah! She is cool  and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious .  That's not how she used it...?
Ross, Uhm no! Think less of you! No  I don't think less of you. I mean  you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean  those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid  I hate those people.
Ross, Yeah  I know the type.
Joey, Hey  if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey you guys! Look what I just got. 
Rachel, Oh  OH! Wow  I love those! Where did you get them?
Phoebe, I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Rachel,  Phoebe  Shania Twain is still alive!
Phoebe, Oh... then I overpaid. 
Monica, Hey  what's this?
Rachel, Oh  it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
Monica, Oh  you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
Rachel, Ah  why  now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal  I can't wear fur  I can't go hunting...
Monica, Do you wanna go hunting?
Rachel, Well  I would like to have the option!!
Phoebe,  What's up?  Hey  Rachel!!
Rachel, Oh!
Phoebe," No  you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!"
Monica, And she wants to go hunting  too!!
Rachel, Phoebe  come on  I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
Phoebe, Ok  this is not about the MONEY  ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
Rachel, I don't care about any of that!!
Phoebe, Well  do you care about friendship?
Rachel, Oh!
Phoebe, I feel really strongly about this  Rachel. Please  don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
Rachel, Oh  not as a friend  Phoebe!! Fine  I won't use it!
Phoebe, Promise?
Rachel, I promise.
Phoebe, Thank you. 
Rachel, But I am going hunting!!
Monica,  Hey honey! I missed you today!
Chandler, Oh  yeah?
Monica, Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
Chandler, Oh  well... Maybe we could... 
Monica, Ok  trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides  tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Chandler, We really need to take those tests?
Monica, Honey  we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
Chandler, But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Monica, What is the big deal?
Chandler, It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Monica, It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
Chandler,  I cannot believe Ross told you that!  And in my defense  it was a Wendy's!
Monica, Look  I don't wanna do this test either  but I really do think it's a good idea!
Chandler, Yeah  ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Monica,  OH!
Chandler, Oh  yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
Joey,  Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
Joey, Heeey!
Joey, Come on in  how are ya?
Joey, Can I offer you a drink?
Joey, Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too  today I had to open a door and go  ohhhh!
Joey, Hey  if you need a tour guide... 
Joey, Yeah  definitely  definitely. Ok  what do you wanna see first?
Joey,  Ok!
Joey, I know  yeah!
Joey, Ok  let me stop you right there. The Mets suck  ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
Joey, Which one  they all suck!
Joey,  I don't think so.
Rachel,  Hi there!
Rachel, Oh  hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green  and here is my gift certificate.
Rachel, And... taped back together.
Rachel, Ok
Rachel,  through the glass doors.
Rachel, Alright-y then.
Phoebe, Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?  Oh  no  no! Listen  is there someone who can fill in for me?
Phoebe, But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
Phoebe, 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Phoebe,  Ok  are they listening?
Joey, Ross!
Ross, Hi!
Joey, I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Ross,  Oh  do you  do you really?
Joey, Yeah  I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
Ross," Look  if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" means  just don't use it!"
Joey, No  look  you know Charlie  right? She's cool  she's funny  her body is soo...
Ross, Get to the problem!
Joey, Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
Ross,  Are you wearing two belts?
Joey,  EH  what do you know!
Ross, You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Joey, Right  right  right  well  she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Ross, You know  I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
Joey, Please  c'mon  you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl  ok  I don't wanna lose her.
Ross,  Fine.
Joey, Thanks.
Ross, Ok. Let's see. Oh  you should take her to the MET!
Joey, The Metsss!
Ross, Oh  no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Joey,  Oh  that's what she meant!  You know  if they're gonna shorten it  they should call it the MUSE! You know  short for museum  and avoid all the confusion!
Ross, Yeah  most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Joey, Ok  all right  so I'll take her to the MET.
Ross, Yeah  uh  uh  ok  there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture  you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Joey, Geez  sounds like you should be going on this date!
Ross, But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Joey, Whoa  whoa  whoa! Slow down  you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET  ok?
Ross, Ok.
Joey, You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
Ross, Ok  when you walk in the museum  take the right  that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt  Mesopotamia  up to the Byzantine Empire.
Joey, Whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa! So  I walk in the door and make the right 
Chandler, I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
Monica, Because  honey  I mean this in the sweetest way possible  nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
Chandler, Deposit my specimen? You know  usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks  got it.
Monica, Hey  honey  my test is down the hall  are you sure you're going to be ok?
Chandler, Yeah  I guess!
Monica, I know this is embarrassing  but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Chandler, Oh  Come on!
Monica, Hey  we're probably fertile  let's go home!
Chandler, Why are you here?
Chandler,  No no no... I mean  why? why is she here??
Chandler, What!?
Monica, This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to! 
Chandler, I'd love to stay  but I have eh...  got a hot date... 
Chandler,  I think it just fell off. 
Phoebe,"  Hello ""ja""  it's time for your massage  ja! Put your face in the hole."
Rachel, Wow  a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person. 
Phoebe, Okay  then I'm Swedish...
Monica, So  what's your name?
Phoebe, It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
Rachel, Oh... what an interesting name.
Phoebe, Ja!
Rachel, You know I... 
Phoebe,  Time for your scalp massage!
Rachel,  Wow... I really love your... 
Phoebe, Is something wrong?
Rachel, No  it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...  Yeah  say hey  you'll know this  what's the capital of Sweden?
Phoebe,  Uhm... Stockholm.
Rachel, Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Joey,  Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Ross, Now  do you have any idea what you just said?
Joey,  No  no  my mouth says the words  my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ross, Ok now  remember  when you get to the museum  Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Joey, Phonetically? 
Ross, Yeah  yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Joey, Ok.
Ross, Ok  but you know what? I gotta say  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Joey," Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""."
Ross, Wow. What does that mean?
Joey," No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear""."
Ross, Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Joey, Ok  Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it  it's really bumpy! .
Ross, Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude  you can't touch the paintings.
Joey, Come on! you... 
Ross, No! 
Chandler,  My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along!  Janice! You're not... gone?
Chandler, Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
Chandler, I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Chandler,  Yeah  but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
Chandler,  oh  oh  yeah  ok  thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
Chandler,"  It was a ""Wendy's!! """
Phoebe,"  ""Ipan Stripan  Glupi Glabi! "" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking! "
Rachel, Wow  Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm  you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Phoebe, Oh  Ja! Ja!
Rachel, Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though... 
Phoebe, Uhu  uhu... and why do you think that is?
Rachel, I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Phoebe, Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
Rachel,  Phoebe!!
Phoebe, You know it's me?
Rachel, For like a half an hour! Man  you can lie about Sweden!
Phoebe, How can you come here?
Rachel, How could you not tell me you worked here?
Phoebe, I don't have to tell you everything!
Rachel, Yes you do  if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Phoebe, Tips not included.
Rachel, Oh! Phoebe  why did you lie to me about working here?
Phoebe, Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical  and dental  and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
Rachel, Phoebe  honey  if you hate it so much  you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey  you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Phoebe, You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
Rachel, Good for you Pheebs!
Phoebe, Ok.
Phoebe, Okay  If you guys have microphones in there too  I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
Ross, Haha! Got ya! Die  die  die!
Ross,  Respectfully  professor R. Geller.  Hey!
Ross, Hey  how was the Met?
Ross, Yeah? Joey really knows his art  huh?
Ross, What do you mean?
Ross,  Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met  did you go to the right?
Ross,  Oh Joey  Joey! But still  I mean  it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
Ross, What?
Ross, What  I mean  a little  but no  what  go on.
Ross,  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean  he's a great guy  and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know  you can always talk about that with someone else.
Ross, And if you think about it  I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know  that's the kind of guy Joey is.
Ross, That was going to be my next argument.
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Joey,  You're ready?
Joey,  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked  you hooked me up.
Ross, Glad I could help man.
Joey, Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be  but...  I made it work.
Chandler,  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
Chandler, Hello? Oh hi  Doctor Connelly.  No  she's not here but  you know  I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well  so what does that mean?  Ok. Ok  thank you. Thanks. 
Monica, Hey sweetie.
Chandler, Doctor Connelly just called.
Monica," With good news?  Of course it is not good news  you just said  ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said  ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem  uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?"
Chandler, Actually it's both of us.
Monica, What?
Chandler, Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
Monica, Oh... what does that mean?
Chandler, It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...
Monica, Chandler?
Chandler,  It means that we can keep trying  but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
Monica,  Oh my God!
Chandler, I'm sorry.
Monica, I'm sorry too.
Chandler, Well  we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
Monica,  I know.
Phoebe,  Good morning receptionist.
Phoebe, Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch  she came back?
Phoebe,  Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole  lassy.
Rachel,  Oh  lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Rachel, Oh... Oh  I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Rachel," Yeah  yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin""."
Joey, So you need someone who knows fashion  to tell you what looks good.
Rachel,  Not me  not me  not me  not me  not me!
Joey, Oh hey Rach!
Rachel, Yeah...
Joey, Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Rachel, Oh  well...
Joey, Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah  she's the one who taught me  you don't wear white after labour day and that you always  always  always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Rachel, Ok  uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Joey,  Ok  you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie  SLUTTY!
Phoebe,  Ok  great! All right  bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off  right?
Joey, What's the matter  Pheebs?
Phoebe," Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight  he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh  don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!"
Rachel, Which you're not  because you've totally hung up on him!
Phoebe, Exactly!
Rachel, And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Phoebe,  I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh  sexual politics!!
Rachel, Hey Pheebs  I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping  why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Phoebe, Ok  that'll be great!
Joey, Oh  ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Rachel, That's not what we're gonna do!
Joey, Why would you ruin it  who was that hurtin'?
Chandler,  Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!
Monica, Oh  I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Chandler, Oh  I can't believe my sperm have low motility because  let me tell you  when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!
Chandler, Hi.
Monica, Hi.
Monica, Ok.
Chandler, Oh  DAMN IT!
Monica, Don't worry  after a while he'll tune it out.
Monica,  Ok.
Chandler, Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child!  Wow  talking about an inhospitable environment!
Rachel, Hi! Ok  you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?
Joey,  Alright  have a good time. 
Rachel, Not gonna find any clothes in there!
Ross,  Hey  you guys!
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Ross, Yeah  right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well  why are you laughing?
Joey, Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun  yeah!
Ross, Professor Sherman  yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Ross, Yeah  well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
Rachel, Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick  are ya?
Ross, Tsz... NO! .
Chandler,  Hey guys!
Ross, Wait a minute  you guys. Oh  I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do  I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
Chandler, I think I can safely say that we all have family issues  work stuff and/or are sick.
Ross, It's in Barbados.
Chandler, But you come first!
Rachel, I'm there!
Joey, Bye.
Rachel, Bye  see ya. 
Chandler,  Ok.
Joey, All right  so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Chandler, Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
Ross, So-so what did the doctor say?
Chandler, Well... there's surrogacy  but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child  she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
Joey, So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Chandler, Yeah.
Joey, So  I don't have to learn what that means?
Chandler, Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination  so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Joey, Enough said  I'm there for you man. Where is she  upstairs?
Chandler,  ah-ha!
Ross, How do you feel about all this?
Chandler, I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Joey, Come on Ross  be a good guy. Step up and do it!
Ross,  What?
Ross,  What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Ross, The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.
Ross,  I mean  we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given  but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions  you know  right in the trash.  So-so what I am saying is - is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean  not just in palaeontology  but if-if you think about it  in evolutionary biology  uh  genetics  geology  uh  I mean  truly the mind boggles!
Ross, Oh  that's not what you want...
Phoebe, Oh  I'll take some of that.
Rachel, Pheebs  that's for men!
Phoebe, No  I know  this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.
Phoebe, Ok. Oh good  I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Rachel," On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here."
Rachel, Really?
Rachel, Oh  I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Rachel, Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies  you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Phoebe,  Hey Rach  will you come with me to a dressing room?
Rachel, Sure!
Phoebe, Ok!
Rachel, You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Phoebe, So what were you doing out there  do you not like Charlie?
Rachel, She's ok  I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Phoebe, Why?
Rachel, I don't know  you know  just the way she waltzed in here all smart  and tall! You know  and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean  nobody else has a chance!
Phoebe, Who else?
Rachel, Anybody! You  me  you know  Monica's mom...
Phoebe, You like Joey?
Rachel, Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right  look. I have a little thing for him.
Phoebe,  Oh my God!
Rachel, It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just  when I see them together  sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Phoebe, Uh  wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Rachel,  Oh  I get it!
Phoebe, Oh well  as long as it is under control  you know  you can't do anything about it  he's already dating her  and she is a nice person  that wouldn't be right.
Rachel, I know  I know  so it is just not a big deal.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Rachel, So can we keep this between us?
Phoebe, Sure!
Rachel, Ok  great  because I gotta get out of here  the smell of beets is killing me!
Phoebe, Oh.
Phoebe, Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Monica, Hi honey!
Chandler, Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner  this is Zack  from work!
Monica, Oh  of course  it's so nice to see you again  Zack!
Chandler, You guys haven't actually met before  but  boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack  and I'll get you a beer.
Monica, I got it.
Chandler,  So  Zack's pretty nice  uh?
Monica, Yeah  I guess.
Chandler, So  how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Monica,  Excuse me?
Chandler," Well  we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean  look  he's intelligent  he's healthy  he's athletic  I mean  he is ""spermtastic""!"
Monica," Chandler  this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up  meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!"
Chandler, No  I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean  if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy  get to check him out.
Monica, Chandler!
Chandler, I'm telling you  he's great! I mean  even if my sperm worked fine  I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Monica, I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!
Chandler, Ok!
Monica, Uh!
Chandler,  Zack!
Monica, Tell me about yourself  Zack!
Rachel, Oh  God  do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!
Phoebe, Well  maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room  you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Rachel, Ok  great!
Rachel, Oh  thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!
Phoebe,  I didn't say anything yet!
Rachel,  Well  get back in there and talk!
Phoebe,  I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Rachel,  What!?
Phoebe,  Well  some things are just hard to say to your face.
Rachel, Ok well  I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!
Phoebe, Ooh! We have a problem.
Rachel, Oh! What are we gonna do?
Rachel, Oh my God!
Rachel,  Alright! Enough out of you!
Joey, Hello?
Ross, Joey! Hey  I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Joey, No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Ross, I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Joey, Oh! How's it going?
Ross, It could be better! He  uhm... he fell asleep!
Joey, What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!
Ross, Barbados.
Joey, Fine  I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross  you have to get that job!
Ross, What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Joey, Well  just wake him up!
Ross, I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep  I won't get the job!
Joey, Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute  this happened to me before! Yeah  I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey  Shakespeare  how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Monica, Hey guys! Dinner's ready!
Chandler, So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes  those cheeckbones!
Monica, Ok  there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!
Chandler, You don't like him.
Monica, I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.
Chandler, Alright! Just follow my lead!
Chandler, Oh! Thanks  I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Chandler,  That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
Monica, Oh  friends first  drunk in London  you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?
Monica, Eh... Heart Disease  Alzheimers  gout?
Monica, We're just making conversation. 
Chandler, You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness 
Chandler, I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Monica, Yess!! 
Chandler,  We're teeth people Zack!
Rachel, Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Phoebe, Good plan.
Rachel, Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?
Phoebe," Oh! I'm sorry Rachel  I don't have time for your childish games  ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""! "
Rachel,  Hey  hi! Hey  where've you been?
Rachel,  Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well  that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!
Rachel, Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok  listen  let me explain.
Rachel,  Yeah.
Rachel, Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know  she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!
Rachel, Yeah...
Rachel,  I try...
Ross,  Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! 
Joey,  Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
Phoebe, Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Joey, Then don't go!
Phoebe, Mike knows I'm coming  and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Joey, Alright  then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!
Phoebe, You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made  ok  because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Phoebe, David?
Phoebe, Oh my God! 
Phoebe, Yeah. What-what are you doing here?
Phoebe, What happened?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Phoebe, Well  it's great that you're back! How are you?
Phoebe, Good!
Phoebe,  Oh  good for you.
Phoebe, Mike and I broke up.
Phoebe, Really?
Phoebe, I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok  so we're both living in New York  not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!
Phoebe, Well...  no.
Phoebe, I'd love to.
Phoebe, Ok. 
Phoebe, Oh  got it  stay upwind of me.
Rachel, No  that's David.
Rachel,  Tip of the iceberg.
Chandler, You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Chandler, Are you just tired now or are you always tired  'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Chandler, Ok.
Chandler, I think we've found our sperm!
Monica, Does seem pretty perfect.
Chandler, Yeah  you think so  well? Should I ask him?
Monica,  No.
Chandler, Why not  just because his great-grandmother was obese  our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Monica, No  that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before  I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
Chandler, Yeah  he's better!
Monica, No  he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you  then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
Chandler, Really? Are you sure?
Monica, Yeah  I'm sure.
Chandler,  Thank God  because I don't wanna do this either. You know  I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know  I'm the husband  I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Monica, That is so sweet. I love you. 
Chandler, So you know this leaves us with...
Monica, Adoption.
Chandler, How do you feel about that?
Monica, I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
Chandler, Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
Monica, So this is it  we're really gonna adopt?
Chandler,  Yeah.
Monica,  Oh my God  we're gonna be parents!
Chandler, We are gonna be great parents.
Monica, And it could be soon. I mean  think about it: right now  somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.
Chandler, Wait  if we're lucky  and we're really really really quiet  we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
Chandler, Hey  Zack!
Chandler, Look  I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
Chandler, Really?
Chandler, My wife and I have some boundary issues  you know  sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.
Chandler, You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby  would ya?
Joey,  Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
Ross, Oh  that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados  right?
Joey, Mmh-mmh.
Ross,  Can you say Barbados?
Joey, Barbados!
Ross, Ok  I gotta say. I mean  it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise  uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Rachel, Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Chandler," Yeah Ross  I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do  you know  ""island's stuff""."
Phoebe, I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Ross, Oh  right  because he's a scientist!
Phoebe, No  no  because  you know  he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight  he'll die.
Ross, Ok  we gotta go  yeah? So  we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Joey, All right  let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie  have a couple of drinks  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Ross, It's a blanket Joe  not a cloak of invisibility!
Ross,  Look at all these paleontologists!!
Joey, I know  there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow! 
Joey,  I think I've been recognized  this happens all the time!
Joey, That... never happens...
Ross, Wow! This is very flattering  uh...
Ross," Uh  uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear..."" "
Ross," ""... Sarah. I dig you""  Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller""."
Ross, Yeah  oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague  uh  Professor Wheeler  a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey," No  God  no! No! No no  I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives""."
Ross," Dude  it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the."
Joey,  Ok  Ross! It's... It's fun  yeah! No  I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Joey, You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Monica, David  can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Monica,  See?
Chandler," Yeah  that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
Monica, Alright  I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Phoebe, Oh  I should go  too. Oh  now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Phoebe, Mike?? Who's Mike?
Phoebe, That's right! Oh  yeah... Well  I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
Phoebe, Really  it doesn't mean anything. I mean  you know  Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
Chandler,  She does?
Monica,  Let's get you out of here!! 
Monica, At least you took me down with you!
Phoebe, I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David  and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away  right?
Monica, I guess  in time.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, I mean  my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.
Phoebe, You just did it again. Chandler  your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
Chandler, I wouldn't read too much into it.
Chandler, David  let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice  go to Ross  Monica  or... Joey  if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Chandler, Seriously  we're gonna do this?
Chandler, Oh  because his penis was too big.  Oh  I'm sorry  that's the kind of thing I do.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey  what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Chandler, What?
Chandler, I didn't mean now...
Chandler, Well  you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Chandler, David  I'm pretending to read here!!
Joey, Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
Joey, Hey  hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong  where's the thong?
Joey, You really should have been more clear about that!
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross,  You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Joey, Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Ross, Yeah  she never misses these conferences!  No  I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Ross, Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Joey," You could say: ""Hey Kenny  how come you're not Britney Spears?"" "
Ross,  Ready to go?
Joey, Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey,  Will you wear a thong?
Joey, Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Ross,  I'm good  I have dinner plans .
Joey, Yeah  yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach  go swimming...
Ross, Uh  Joe  have you looked outside?
Joey, No  why?
Joey, Oh man!
Joey, I wasn't gonna swim  I was gonna dig a hole! 
Monica, Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.
Chandler,"  I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do""  ""I do""."
Monica, Ok  I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play  because you are pink with barely controlled glee.
Chandler, David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Monica, What?  Why?
Chandler, Be-cause  we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Monica, Chandler  we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
Chandler, I did! A penis one! Look  just so I know  what was so wrong about what I said?
Monica," They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No""  David's heart will be broken  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again."
Chandler, Man  that's some bad advice!
Joey, Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!
Rachel, Hey! Hey what's going on?
Joey, Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long  nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Rachel, Alright  I don't wanna alarm anybody  but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Monica, Ok! When I go places with high humidity  it gets a little extra body  ok?!
Chandler, That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
Joey, Come on  I'll show you guys where to check in 
Monica,  Oh  honey  can you make sure we get a King size bed!
Phoebe,  Oh! David  get one for us too! Oh  oh  and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Monica,  And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .
Rachel, Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people  you known it's such a romantic place. That's all  I just wish I could  share that with a guy.
Phoebe, Not Joey.
Rachel, Not Joey  no  I was just lusting after Chandler.
Monica, Yeah  right!
Chandler, Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh  there it is!
Chandler,  Nice! 
Chandler, Monica  can I talk to you for a sec? 
Monica, Ok!
Chandler, David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
Monica, See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Chandler, That would be advice!!
Monica, Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?
Phoebe, Yeah?
Monica,  I need to talk to you.
Phoebe," Are you leaving ""The Supremes""? "
Phoebe, Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Monica, What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Phoebe," Oh  ok  you want me to marry Mike? Alright  well  let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike  do you take Phoebe...""  You know  it's every girl's dream!"
Monica, Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Phoebe, Sure! Look  ok  bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way  Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Ross, By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way  bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.
Ross, Oh and you know what  it will be even better tomorrow  because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .
Joey, Hey guys!
Ross, The chocolates aren't here yet.
Joey, Damnit!
Chandler, Oh  is it on the computer  cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
Ross, If you want to check your email  just ask! 
Chandler,  What?  May I?
Rachel,  What's with the rain  Geller? I mean  when I signed up for Dino Week  nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
Rachel, It's not the time Charlie.
Chandler,  Oh  no  no  no dear God  no!
Joey, Oh what  did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?
Chandler, Your computer  I don't know wha... everything's gone!
Ross, Wha... what do you mean? 
Chandler, It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
Ross, What  oh my God. What did you do?
Chandler, Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Ross, Why  why would you open it?
Chandler," Well  it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!"
Ross, What did it say?
Chandler, Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Ross, What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone  Chandler!
Chandler, It's not gone! I mean  I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy  right?
Ross, NO! I don't!!
Chandler, Well  you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Joey, It's really gone?
Ross, Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Chandler, I just feel awful.
Ross, Yeah  well you should! I mean  nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean  she's never even won a major tournament!
Chandler," Well  I tried Billy Jean King  but...  you know  you and Monica have the same ""I'm gonna kill you"" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her... "
Ross, Get out! 
Rachel, You know  this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Ross, Well  what do you do?
Rachel, Well  I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
Ross, I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Joey, I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Ross, I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now  Joe!
Ross, Wha... what you really think we can do that?
Joey, Hey don't worry about that! I mean  Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Rachel, Ugh.
Ross, Alright  ok  let's do it.  Uhm  I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm  and then  then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era  the breakup of Pangea  hello!  And then  there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Joey," Oh  oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far  far away""? ."
Monica," Ok  Mike  enough is enough  now you love Phoebe and she loves you  so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!"
Monica," This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen  Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her  and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!"
Monica, I... I'm sorry  did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! 
Monica, You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you  you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity?  Damnit!
Monica,  Well  I hope you're happy!
Chandler,  Oooh! I hope you're happy too  honey!
Monica," Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See  that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!"
Chandler," Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's  that's great!"
Monica, No it's not  b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Chandler, And there's not chance that will work?
Monica, No  I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Chandler,  Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Monica, Well  if you hadn't meddled to start with  I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now  no matter how much we meddle  we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Chandler, This vacation sucks!!
Joey, I'm so bored! Stupid rain  we... we can't do anything.
Rachel, Well  I've brought some books. We could read.
Joey, Hey  it hasn't come to that yet.
Joey,  Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!
Joey, Hey Rach  do you feel like going to a convention?
Rachel, We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Joey,  I know we're not  but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
Rachel,  Kate Miller?
Joey, Kate Miller it is. 
Rachel, And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Joey, In that case should I make sure it's on real good? 
Rachel, Thank you. 
Ross, Yeah  that's it?
Ross, Oh my God  we did it! 
Ross, Yes  but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing  thank you  thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
Ross, Hey  what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? 
Ross, Oh my God  I love you.
Ross, That's Ben  my son from my first marriage.
Ross, Yeah.
Ross, No. 
Ross,  Oh  it was... it's complicated  you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
Ross, Ok  odd thing to get excited about!
Ross, Hey! High-five! 
Ross, My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Ross," I know! It's like  if you knew  why didn't you tell me  you know? I mean  call  or leave a note: ""Hi  I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"""
Ross, And then  you try to make the best of a bad situation  so you float the idea of a threesome?
Ross,  Me neither.
Joey, Well  who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
Rachel, I know  that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Joey, Not enough pills in the world  Rach. What about you  you're the single one  seen anybody in there you like?
Rachel, Well  let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to  with the really nice breasts...
Joey, But what about back home  anything going on there? Anybody you like?
Rachel,  No.
Joey, There it is  you're blushing!
Rachel, No  I'm not blushing  I'm sunburnt! From  you know  the rain.
Joey, You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? 
Rachel, No.
Joey, Tell me who it is.
Rachel, Joey! 
Joey, Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like  who?
Rachel, Joey  come on! It doesn't matter  you know  it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Joey, What? Why not? Rach  who can you not get?
Rachel, Oh!  Ok. Ok  you really wanna know who it is?
Joey,  Yeah  who is that?
Rachel, Do ya?
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Right  of course. Hey  did you guys finish the speech?
Ross, Yep  we got it  we got it.  Thank you so much.
Joey, Alright  hey look  and this isn't over  because I really wanna know who...
Rachel, Later! La...
Joey, Yeah. 
Rachel, Ok. See you  bye.
Ross, Good night.
Joey, Night.
Monica, I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.
Chandler, You know  it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Monica, Oh my God  he's gonna do it now. Please  I cannot watch this  let's go.
Chandler," I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  ""Uh  Phoebe  uh  I would be honoured  uh..."" Spit it out  David!"
Phoebe, Sure  ok  yeah.
Phoebe, Oh my God  Mike!
Phoebe, No  Mike's here.
Monica, IT'S THE HUMIDITY!
Phoebe, What are you  what are you doing here?
Monica, You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now  I don't actually have a ring...
Chandler, I wouldn't brag too much about that thing  big guy.
Phoebe,  No!
Phoebe, I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere  you know  that we had a future.
Phoebe, David  I'm so sorry  I'm sorry.
Phoebe, Yeah  I might have said yes  but that would have been wrong.
Phoebe, Yes! 
Monica,  BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?
Chandler, Oh  ain't this nice? It's so quiet  I could just lie here all day.
Monica, I know 
Rachel,  Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
Chandler, I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
Monica, The sun is out!
Chandler, Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Monica, Ok listen  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs  and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Chandler, Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Rachel, Nooo!
Monica, Damn it!
Ross,  Walls are pretty thin  guys!
Ross, Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Rachel, Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled  I'm so jealous!
Ross, Finally  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus  Argentinasaurus...
Chandler,  Not to mention the cold sores.
Ross, And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores  their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Chandler,  Really?
Ross, But all kidding aside  in much the same way that Homo ergaster  is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
Joey," He said ""erectus""!"
Joey, No  he really said it.
Ross, ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Joey, Erectus?
Rachel, Homo.
Ross, ... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.  Thank you!
Ross, Oh  thanks guys!
Ross, Oh!
Ross,  Ok... now... now we're just holding hands! 
Rachel, All right! Well  uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?
Monica, Yeah!
Rachel,  It was really... great!
Ross, Oh  thank you so much!
Joey, Yeah  and so funny!
Rachel, Oh!
Ross,  Ok!... All right  thanks! Thank you so much  you guys!  Oh  I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
Ross,  Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Ross, Hey!  Well...? 
Ross, Yeah?
Ross, Oh  I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh  did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
Ross, No  it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Ross,  I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Ross,  Look  I took it too far!
Monica,  I can't believe it's raining again! Oh  it's so unfair!!!
Phoebe, Well  on the bright side  now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  Not you guys. You got it going on!
Monica, So  what are we gonna do today?
Monica,  Ping pong?  Honey  they have ping pong! Let's play!
Chandler, I don't think so!
Monica,  Why not?
Chandler, Because you know how competitive you get and well  I say it's cute  others disagree  and I'm lying!
Monica, I'm not always that bad!
Chandler, Oh  yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Monica,  I punched you...?
Chandler, And...?
Monica, ... Phoebe...?
Phoebe, ... and...?
Monica, I clunked your heads together!
Joey, Hey!  As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and  if you blow bubbles in its face  it chases ya! 
Joey,  Oh... oh  but that's ok  I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone  but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Joey,  Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you  stuck in that room  working on Ross's speech... 
Joey,  Oh! Oh  well! At least we're both having fun!
Joey, Yeah! A little bit  yeah...
Joey, Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
Monica, C'mon guys  it'll be fun!
Phoebe, All right  all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
Monica, But then how do we know who wins?
Phoebe, Nobody wins!
Monica, So  we're just four losers... SUPER!
Chandler, I'm not playing with you.
Phoebe, Yeah  I'm out.
Monica,  OK!
Phoebe, Mike  you don't know  you don't know what you're doing!
Chandler, She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!
Monica, Sure! Got to!
Monica, Aww!
Chandler,  Oh dear God  there's two of them!
Monica, Hell  yeah!
Chandler,  Did you know this about him?
Phoebe, No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Monica, How much were you thinking?
Monica, Make it fifty!
Monica,  One thousand...
Chandler,  OK!
Monica,  No...  Either of you girls got a quarter?
Chandler, Honey  try to focus the trash talk on him!
Phoebe,  Monica  you call it.
Monica, Heads! No  Tails! He-he-heads!
Phoebe, Tails!
Monica,  Ow  what are the chances!
Monica, Ha! My point!
Phoebe,  He was a lawyer!
Rachel, Oh! Weather bitch! 
Rachel, It's open!  Hi  Joe!
Joey,  Hey...
Rachel,  What  is everything ok?
Joey, Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Rachel, Nooooo  why?
Joey, Oh well  she said we have nothing in common.
Rachel,  Oh  that's crazy!
Joey, No  it's not  we have nothing in common!
Rachel, ... yeah  it's true.
Joey, I mean  she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean  he uses all those big words too! Man  smart people are dull!
Rachel,  What  hey!
Joey,  Ok  Rach!
Joey, I feel so stupid  you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
Rachel, W-What are you  what are you talking about?
Joey, Oh  c'mon  I mean  there's you  then there's Charlie  and it's like...  What the hell is my problem? OH! 
Rachel, Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Joey,  I'm telling you  Rach  Charlie is not right for me!
Rachel, Yeah  I'm not talking about her...
Joey, But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? 
Rachel, You know? Forget it!
Joey,  No-no-no-no  no! Who  who were you talking about?
Rachel, No  I-I-I-I don't  I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Joey, Ok! All right  well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Rachel, Yeah  sure!
Joey, You like me? 
Rachel,  Ok  let's not make a big thing about this!
Joey,  That's a huge thing!
Rachel, Not working with me  Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings  if you will!
Joey, What... for how long?
Rachel, Only like a month!
Joey,  A MONTH??
Rachel, What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Listen  ok  and maybe they're crazy thoughts  but sometimes I do  I have  I've been thinking about... you know  us!  Ok  dial it up a little!
Joey,  I just have one question!
Rachel, Shoot!
Joey,  What the hell are you doin'???
Rachel, I don't know  I'm not trying to do anything  it's just  we have such a good time when we're together  you know... I mean  aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...
Joey, Uh  am I curious? I mean  I am as curious as... as... George!!
Rachel,  Who...?
Joey, CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know  the monkey  and the guy with the yellow hat!
Rachel, Oh yes  of course  I remember him!
Joey, Yeah  he had a paper route.
Rachel, Yeah  he did!  Oh  see  this is what I'm talking about!
Joey, No  I know  yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
Rachel, But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Joey,  NO  NO! It can't happen at all!
Rachel, But why  why not?
Joey, Because... look  no one wants this to happen more than me  ok?  I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!  I couldn't do it to Ross!
Rachel, But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Joey, I know  I know! But I've thought about it a lot since  and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!
Rachel,  I'm sorry  too!  OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Joey, NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey  we'll be fine! Li... hey  like you said: no big deal!
Rachel, It's not a big deal!
Joey, NO BIG DEAL!
Rachel, It's so not a big deal!
Joey, Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Rachel, Ok!
Rachel, Ok  I...
Rachel, AAAHHHH!
Monica, Ooh! I'm sorry! I think  I THINK  that may have missed the table!
Monica, Ah  yeah!
Monica, Ah  yeaaah!
Monica, AH YEAAAAH!
Chandler,  Do you really find this attractive on him?
Phoebe,  Oh  yeah!  Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica  right now?
Chandler, I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Phoebe, C'mon Mike  you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Monica, Oh  damn it!
Phoebe,  I sleep with him!
Monica,  Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh  by the way  how did that feel  losing to a girl?
Monica, NO  NO  NOOO!
Chandler, Okay-dokay  you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Monica, Best out of three?
Chandler, Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Monica,  Serve the ball  chump!
Phoebe,  Ok Mike  better come back Mike  better come back.
Ross, Ooh  well. Ah  I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now  not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man. 
Ross, Get Out!
Ross, Yes  please!  So  what's going on?
Ross, Oh my God  wh-what happened?
Ross, I knew that was him!
Ross,  Hey  you ok?
Ross, Oh  professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation  here.
Ross,  Ok  gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean  we're scientists  right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. . GO  GO  GO! 
Chandler,  Ok  look! Enough is enough!
Monica, No  I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Chandler, Monica  that was also true an hour ago! I mean  please  look at you! Your hand is blistered  you can barely stand  your hair is inexplicable! Ok  you've already proven you are just as good as he is  now we've missed our dinner reservations  so now let's just go upstairs  order room service  take a shower and shave your head!
Monica, I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Chandler, But...
Monica, Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well  this is my sickness!
Chandler, What about the obsessive cleaning?
Monica, That's just good sense!
Monica,  Aww! 
Chandler, You ok?
Monica, No  no  no. Honey  I'm ok. Shake it off!  Oh  no! No shaking  no shaking! Ooh! Ooh!  Oh my God! I can't play!
Phoebe, Mike wins?
Monica, I can't believe it!  I lost!
Chandler, No  you didn't.
Monica, What?
Chandler, Because I'm gonna play for ya.
Phoebe, You can't do that!
Phoebe, Ok  we're taking that paddle home  mister.
Monica,  Honey  you don't have to do this.
Chandler,  Yes  I do. Now  I may not understand why you have to win so badly  but if it's important to you then it's important to me  because I love you.
Monica, But... you suck!
Chandler,  You're welcome  sweetheart.
Chandler, All right Mike  let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point  wins.
Monica, Oh my God! You're good!
Phoebe, It's like watching porn!
Chandler, And that's... how... it's done!
Monica,  Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you  Hold on! I almost forgot  loser!  When did you stop sucking?
Chandler, I never sucked  I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Monica, Why?
Chandler, I don't know.
Monica, This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Chandler, That's why!
Ross, Hi.
Ross, Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties  the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know  we as a group are not the coolest.
Ross, I don't think they saw us.
Ross,  Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Ross, I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past  so...
Ross, I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Ross, I mean  you just went out with my best friend  and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.  Or-or not! 
Rachel, What?
Monica, Oh  the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? 
Chandler, You know  I'd love to  but I'm a little tired.
Monica, I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
Chandler, You're on!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, What's up?
Phoebe, Well  okay  Mike's taking a shower  which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food  so if you want...
Ross, ... finally...
Phoebe, Is that Ross?
Monica, Yeah  you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Phoebe, Sounds like he's with someone.
Chandler, He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups  and then talk to his triceps.
Monica, Wait a minute  I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
Ross, God  you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Monica, Oh my God  that's Charlie!
Chandler, She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Phoebe, Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Monica, I'm not sure about this.
Phoebe, Yeah  you're right. This is none of our business.
Monica, No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
Phoebe, Oh  I'm not gonna do this  okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
Rachel,  Ooh... I love Barbados!
Joey, Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Rachel, I know  I'm her!
Phoebe,  Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Get over here!
Rachel, ooh...
Chandler, Wow!
Monica,  Oh my God  I love how thin these walls are!
Monica,  Thank you.
Rachel, Hey  you know  before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
Joey, Well  I only said that because of Ross  you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
Rachel, What? Ross and Charlie?  Wow! She's really making her way through the group  huh? Ah  who am I to talk?
Monica, I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
Chandler, How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Monica, I'm on it!
Chandler, Anything?
Monica, I think I hear curtains closing...
Phoebe, We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Monica, Bedsprings  unmistakable!
Chandler, You do realise that's your brother?
Monica, Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie  Joey and Rachel  Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
Chandler, That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Monica, Okay  I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning  before we leave  I'm going to the salon.
Chandler, Okay Buckwheat!
Phoebe, You gotta hear this  it's great... It's like free porn! 
Ross, Weh...*sigh*
Ross, Yeah  It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Ross, No  NO!  Look  I need to talk to Joey. I mean  you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us  I need to know he's okay with it.
Ross, Alright  I'm gonna go find them...  I just need a... need a before I can... you know.  Grandma... grandma... grandma...  Okay  I see you later.
Phoebe, That's the door. He's gone...
Chandler, And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
Monica, Honey  if you know it through a wall  you know it too well!
Ross, Hey  what are you guys doing?
Phoebe, Oh  we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.  I love you... Paradise Hotel  Golf resort and Spa... 
Monica,  Yeah  we had a great time  thank you! 
Chandler,  Bye!
Ross, Okay  uhm... Hey  you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Chandler, He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... 
Ross, Well  if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Chandler, You got it!
Ross, Thanks!  Thank you! 
Monica, Other wall  people! Other wall!
Ross,  Rach  you there? 
Joey, Oh my God  it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Rachel, Oh  ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!
Joey, No idea what it means.
Rachel, Oh... okay  just hide!
Ross,  Rach?
Rachel, Coming! Try under the bed  try under the bed!
Rachel, There's no room under the bed. 
Ross, Is everything okay?
Rachel, Yeah... 
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hi...
Ross, You know where Joey is?
Rachel, ...I really don't... 
Ross, Can I talk to you for a minute?
Rachel, Yeah  sure... 
Joey, I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Phoebe, Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Ross, And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up  and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Rachel,  Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Ross, And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Rachel,  Oh  I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Ross, Anyway  one thing lead to another  and... oh... before you know it  we were kissing. I mean  how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
Rachel,  That is hard to say  Ross. That is hard to say.
Ross, You know  I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Rachel, You would think!
Rachel, Joey!
Joey, Is he gone?
Rachel,  How are you doing this?
Joey, Pssst...
Rachel, How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Phoebe, Now  what is this?
Rachel, Ah  what is this? Well  lets see  we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it  so I guess this is sixth grade!
Phoebe, Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
Joey, Well  he's with Charlie now.
Monica, Yeah  but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend  I mean  don't you think he deserves the same from you?
Joey,  You're a pain in my ass  Geller!
Rachel, All right  look you guys... Look  we appreciate all the advice  but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Chandler, Okay  well we'll go back in there  but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
Rachel, Sure...
Chandler, Enunciate!
Rachel, Get out!
Rachel, Are they right?
Joey, Probably  yeah... I mean  maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
Rachel, Yeah... Yeah  we can wait  we don't have to do anything tonight.
Joey, Yeah  I think that'd be best... So  so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
Rachel,  Although...
Joey,  I like although!
Rachel, I mean  you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Joey, Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Rachel, Plus  you know  he is with Charlie now.
Joey, Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Rachel, No...
Joey, I'm thinking about you...
Rachel, Yeah...
Joey, Let's forget about Ross...
Rachel, Forgotten.
Joey, What's wrong?
Rachel, Nothing...
Rachel, Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here  come here...
Rachel, Sorry  I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
Joey, Well  maybe I can help. 
Joey, Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
Ross, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, You guys ready to go?
Chandler, Not quite. Monica's still at the salon  and I'm just finishing packing.
Ross, Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
Chandler, You're not supposed to take that. Besides  it's a New Testament  what are you gonna do with it?
Ross, Learn about Jesus...
Ross, Hey!
Ross, Uh  no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Ross, Stop it!
Ross, You're filthy!
Phoebe, Hey  have you guys seen Monica?
Ross, Uh  actually I think she went to the salon.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  oh  she went to the salon alright...
Monica, Check it out!
Phoebe, Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
Chandler, Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Monica, What do you think?
Chandler, I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
Monica, Don't you just love it?
Ross, Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
Ross, You've never said that in your life  have you?
Ross, I thought so.
Monica, And listen to this... 
Chandler, What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
Joey, Whoo  whoo. Wow  it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Chandler, Yeah  it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Joey, Look  does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
Ross, Oh  I uh  I mean  I... dude  I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Joey, I understand...
Ross, No  I'll do it. 
Chandler, Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Phoebe, Uhm... You know  once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
Phoebe, Aaah... you're not good at this...
Phoebe, No  I think I can come over. It's Saturday  right?
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe, Why not?
Phoebe, You have a... You have a date? With who?
Phoebe,  You have... have a girlfriend?
Phoebe, For how long?
Phoebe, Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business  but uhm  how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Phoebe, Oh  okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home  maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Phoebe, You know what  we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
Ross," Right  I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says ""duty free""."
Rachel, Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Joey, I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
Rachel, Okay  well keep in mind that by the time you're done  they'll probably be serving dinner.
Joey, Ooh...
Rachel, Still nervous?
Joey, I'm gonna get the lasagna.
Ross, Hey Rach...
Rachel, Yeah!
Ross, Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
Rachel, Yeah  yeah sure! Yeah! 
Ross, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, So  I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Joey, Yeah?
Ross, Okay  last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that  by the way... Well  Charlie and I were talking  and...  well...
Joey, You kissed.
Ross, Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
Joey, I saw you.
Ross, Yeah  we kissed  but... nothing else... nothing else happened  okay.
Joey, Ross  Ross  Ross... It's okay.
Ross, What?
Joey, It's okay. You know  I totally understand  alright? You guys  make way more sense than her and I ever did  you know. And... I want you to be happy.
Ross, Are you serious?
Joey, Yeah... Now I have something...
Ross, I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean  you're an incredible friend  you know that?
Joey, Oh... uh... look... before you...
Ross, No  I mean it. You are so loyal man  and selfless  and generous...
Joey, I am those things  yeah.
Ross, You know what? I know Chandler longer  so I always think of him as my best friend  but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Joey, Dude!
Ross, Hey  if there is ever  anything I can do for you...
Joey, I can't think of anything.
Ross, Thanks!
Joey, Yeah.
Rachel, So hi!
Ross, Hi!
Rachel, So you eh  you talked to Joey?
Ross, Ah  yeah. We had a really good talk.
Rachel, Oh! That's great!
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, Oh  so everything's okay?
Ross, Oh  no  it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
Rachel, Ah... Well  obviously I think so too.
Ross, Well  I'm so excited about this.
Rachel, Really? Excited?
Ross, Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Rachel, Excuse me!  You didn't tell him  did you?
Joey, I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
Rachel, Oh God! Alright  fine. You know what Joey  forget it. When we go back to New York  I will tell him.
Joey, Thank you. Yeah  I appreciate that.
Phoebe, Hi  Mike's place.
Phoebe, Ooh  that was fast.
Phoebe, Yeah  you can't do that! Oh  come on Mike  strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know  women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
Phoebe, Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
Phoebe, Okay  oh and you know  if she gets upset  just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. 
Phoebe,  I... I'm Phoebe.
Phoebe, Enchanté 
Monica, Oh  I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!
Chandler, You go back to work tomorrow night  right?
Monica, Yeah!
Chandler, So if you want people to see them  then by definition you're not having them taken out... say  at the break of dawn?
Monica, Well  if I had them taken out  then I wouldn't be able to do this.  You like that  right? 
Chandler, What are you singing?
Monica," It's ""Bolero"" from ""10""."
Chandler," It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See  here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home  we don't have that problem anymore  so if you think about it... I hate them!"
Monica, You what? You said you liked them.
Chandler, Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Monica, Fine  so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
Chandler, Again  let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said  was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well  Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Monica, You know what? I don't care. I like it like this  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!
Chandler, Hit yourself in the tooth?
Monica, And the eye!
Ross,  Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God  I missed you.  Oh Emma  I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? 
Rachel, That was one time  Ross  and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Ross, Ooh hey  Emma  daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
Rachel, Aaah... Ross  actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Ross,  Okay  shoot!
Rachel, Okay  uhm... alright  here's the deal.
Ross,  OH NO!
Rachel, What? What is it?
Ross, Oh  major shampoo explosion!
Rachel, Uh  look Ross  this really isn't easy.
Ross, Oh  it's all over everything. Why? Why me? 
Rachel, Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Ross, I'm sorry  I'm sorry. You were saying?
Rachel, Well  yeah... Okay  look it's about me and...
Ross, Oh  not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
Rachel, Wow! Well  clearly this is not a good time.
Ross, Duh  you think? 
Phoebe, Okay  bye. Alright  so Mike's on his way over. See  you thought you guys were meeting here  and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant  so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
Phoebe, Alright... Susie  can I call you Susie?
Phoebe, Yeah  I can't say that. uhm... Susie  I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
Phoebe, Well  I don't...
Phoebe, Nothing  there's nothing wrong with you.
Phoebe, Damn it woman  pull yourself together! Have some pride  for the love of God.
Phoebe, Okay  not a fan of the tough love.
Phoebe, But he didn't really know  you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
Phoebe, Look  Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive  intelligent woman and let's face it  Mike's kind of a wang. I mean  he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And  I don't like to kiss-and-tell  but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Phoebe, You're welcome!
Chandler, Honey  you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
Monica, Not really.
Monica, I have a problem.
Chandler, Really? What happened?
Monica," Well  I was dancing around  and singing ""No Woman  No Cry"" and I got stuck."
Chandler, You can't move at all?
Monica, Oh  well  I can move... 
Chandler, If I untangle you  will you please get rid of the corn rose?
Monica,  I guess so...
Chandler,  Some of these look a little frayed.
Monica, Yeah  I tried to gnaw myself free.
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, So  did you err... did you tell Ross?
Rachel, Well  I tried  but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Joey, No  no  no  no  no  no  no  no... I think it's better if you tell him  you know. It's easier for a woman. That way  you know  if he gets mad  all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. 
Rachel, Yeah  'cause that's what we do.
Joey, Alright  alright  okay  uhm... How 'bout this  how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
Rachel, Okay  that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Joey, I know  I know...  but that's okay. I mean  we can control ourselves  we're not animals.
Rachel, No! Of course we can wait. Alright  so I guess that means good night then?
Joey, Yeah! Good night! 
Rachel, Goo--ood night!
Joey, Good night! 
Rachel, Seriously  good night!
Joey, Stop saying good night.
Rachel, Okay.
Monica, Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...
Chandler, Now that I untangled you  how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Monica, Sure  what do you have in mind?
Chandler, I think you know.
Monica, Really? I don't really feel like it.
Chandler, This is what I want to do.
Monica, Okay  I just don't get why you like it so much.
Chandler,  She's an FBI agent  posing as a beauty contestant.
Joey, Okay  Ross  I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that  but.. Let me explain  okay?
Rachel, We weren't doing anything!
Joey, Rach  he just saw us.
Rachel, Shhh.
Joey, But what you saw  that is the extent of it  okay? One kiss.
Rachel, No  come on  that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Rachel, Yeah  you started it! I've got to chill.
Joey, Look  we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened  but..
Rachel, We feel so terrible about this  Ross.
Joey, Yeah  but it did happen  so...
Joey, Ross?
Rachel, Ross?  Can we just close the door?
Rachel, Ross  say something. Anything.
Ross, So you two are..?
Ross, And have you .. ed?
Joey, No  no  no!
Rachel, No  no  no!
Ross, But if I hadn't walked in here  would you..?
Joey, Probably.
Joey, No  no!
Rachel, Ross  this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
Ross, I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Rachel, No  but you know what I mean.
Ross, Hey  hey  hey... If you two are happy  then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Joey, Really?
Ross, Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky  'cause really   I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean  at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
Joey, Ross..
Ross, It's all working out! Me & Charlie  and you two. You know what we should do?
Rachel, Calm ourselves?
Ross, No. We should all have dinner. Yes  we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
Joey, Look  don't you think that will be a little weird?
Ross, Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food  because I'm making fajitas!! 
Joey, I do like fajitas.
Monica, God  this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption  dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go  and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
Chandler, There's a hair in my coffee.
Phoebe, Hey guys!
Monica, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey  have you seen Frank Jr.  'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Chandler," You know  it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets "" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
Monica, That's sweet. Drink your hair.
Phoebe, Hey  what's all this stuff?
Monica, Oh  they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Phoebe, Ooh  babies! Oh  this one is so cute  get this one!
Monica, That's not really how it works.
Phoebe, Oh  how does it work?
Monica, I don't know!
Phoebe, Well  if you're having a hard time  you should talk to my friends  Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Monica, Thanks  that would be great. Hey  honey  wouldn't that be great?
Phoebe, Hey!
Phoebe, Good to see you.
Monica, Hi Frank.
Monica, Oh  my goodness  they've all gotten so big!
Monica, Which one is which again?
Joey, Ah  can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross  and that's cool  but if it was up to me  this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Rachel, Well  what would we be doing?
Joey, I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne  fancy dinner  feel you up on the carriage ride home...
Rachel, Feel me up?
Joey, In a carriage!
Joey, Hey  Charlie!
Rachel, Hey.
Rachel, Oh  you bet.
Joey, So  did you bring a little something for Ross?
Joey, Oh. Oh  thanks.
Joey, Yeah  I didn't throw any of that out..
Ross, I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Hi Joey.  And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.  I'm just kidding  I know Rachel  I know.  Come  please come in. Come in.
Rachel, Okay  well  we brought you some wine.
Ross, Oh! That is so thoughtful.  She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? 
Joey, Uh  actually  that's..
Ross, Underwear  a toothbrush  and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
Ross, What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
Joey, Okay  listen  hey  Ross. Why don't you try to relax  okay? Maybe have a drink.
Ross, You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Phoebe, Oh  god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
Phoebe, Well  they may be a handful  but they're so cute.
Phoebe, Oh  god  the last time I babysat them  they did the funniest thing..
Phoebe, That's a  that's a long time.
Phoebe, Yeah  I know  Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
Phoebe, What?
Phoebe, Oh my god  Frank  are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
Phoebe, What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
Monica, Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
Chandler, So  a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room  huh?
Chandler, I mean  you have a lovely home.
Monica, Well  we appreciate anything you can tell us.
Monica, Oh my god!
Monica, Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
Chandler, That's great.  Can I see the book?
Chandler, You want me to wash my hands first  don't you?
Monica, It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
Monica, Can I adopt you?
Chandler, Hey  you must be Owen.
Chandler, I'm Chandler. Hey  I was in the scouts too.
Chandler, Yeah  in fact my father was a den-mother.
Chandler, You know how to use a compass?
Chandler, You do? That's fantastic!
Chandler, I'd love to  but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Chandler, What?
Chandler, I got nothing.
Ross, The first batch of margaritas was not so great  but the second batch is gooooood.
Rachel, Well  maybe the next batch  we could all get some.
Ross, Oh  guys  this is fun  isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
Joey, Dude  are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Ross, I'm fine! Hey  I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness  no tension.
Rachel, No awareness.
Ross, We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay  where do you think we - we can go?
Ross, My fajitas!!
Rachel, Look  Charlie  I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know  he normally doesn't drink like this.
Ross, Fajitas! Be careful  very hot plate  very hot plate!!
Rachel, Ross  you don't even have oven mitts on!
Ross, That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
Phoebe, Okay  well  this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids  can we?
Phoebe, Insane.
Phoebe, Alice would never go for it  right?
Phoebe, Well  just you know  for argument's sake  you know  hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
Phoebe, Frank Jr.Jr.?
Phoebe, Uh-huh.
Phoebe, Well  alright  that's fine. What about Leslie?
Phoebe, Alright  so that leaves Chandler.
Phoebe, Wow  Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
Phoebe, I'm sorry  Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know  I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day  and I'll be there.
Phoebe, Well  that's not good. But you know  I can move some stuff around  and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
Phoebe, Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
Chandler, Where are Bill and Colleen?
Monica, They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Chandler, We have to leave!!
Monica, Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Chandler, I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way  and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
Monica, Oh my god  where's my purse? No  you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder  and let's go!
Chandler, But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
Chandler, See? Intuitive!
Chandler, Which technically now you should give back!
Chandler," I'm so sorry  but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted  and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
Ross, Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
Rachel, Ooy.
Ross, And to love. Ah  love. L-O-V-E  love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
Rachel, Oh my god  are we supposed to answer?
Ross," O is for ""oh  wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events  which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own."
Joey, Dude  are you okay?
Ross, Totally.
Rachel, Ross  you don't seem okay.
Ross, No!
Ross, Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, Oh  that's okay  girls tend not to like me.
Ross, Okay  I guess it's just flan for three! Hey  hey  that rhymed!
Rachel, You know what  Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Ross, Oh  oh. Of course. God  I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean  you probably just want to be alone.
Rachel, No  no  it's just that it's getting late...
Ross, Hey  hey  it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
Ross, I don't even know what that's for.
Joey, You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Rachel, Yeah  that's probably a good idea.
Joey, Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
Rachel, Uh-huh. Okay. You know what  Joey  I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
Joey, It doesn't look good  does it?
Joey, Morning. Here you go.
Ross, Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Joey, Yeah.
Ross, So you took off my pants and shoes?
Joey, No  no  no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look  Ross  about  about Rachel and I. Listen  you don't have to worry about that  okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
Ross, What do you mean?
Joey, Well  she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
Ross, Hey  what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Joey, It's okay  Ross  alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
Ross, Except we're not. I mean  we haven't been a couple in like  six years. Oh my god  is that right? Has it been that long?
Joey, That's what I hear  yeah.
Ross, This is crazy. I mean  six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really  what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Joey, Come on  I mean  you know me  you know...
Ross, Joey.
Joey, I'm crazy about her.
Ross, And she feels the same way?
Joey, I think so.
Ross, Well  then  maybe it's time we all moved on.
Joey, Yeah  but  Ross  I mean  you're not okay with it.
Ross, No  but I wanna be. Hey  I will be. Besides  I'm with Charlie  right? Oh my god  I'm still with Charlie  aren't I? I mean  she didn't see the dance  did she?
Joey, No  no  no  no  that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
Ross, Yeah  I'm sure.
Joey, And we're okay?
Monica, Hey  Phoebs
Phoebe, Hey.
Monica, Uhm  we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
Chandler, Owen didn't know he was adopted  and Monica told him.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Still  he had to find out sometime.
Chandler, Yeah  but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
Chandler, I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. 
Chandler, So  you and Rachel tonight  huh?
Joey, Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Chandler, Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Joey, Naa  no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Chandler, What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
Joey,  It's OK!
Chandler, How can you be so confident?
Joey, Well  I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Chandler, Really? Like you have a routine?
Joey, No  no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
Chandler, Really?
Joey, No  I do six things! First  I look deep in her eyes. Then  I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Chandler, You mean like this? 
Joey, NO! Not like that  no no. No  like this. 
Chandler, Oh  I see what you mean  that's quite nice. 
Joey, More foosball?
Chandler, ...and beer!!
Monica,  Hey!
Monica,  Hey sweetie! 
Ross,  WOW!
Chandler, Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Ross, I'm sorry  it's just... how did you get so tan?
Chandler, She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Ross, Eh  you got a spray-on tan?
Monica, Chandler gets pedicures!
Ross,  Why  why you do  like with the-the toe separators?
Chandler,  Why...why?
Ross, Still  I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
Chandler, Sure  then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Ross, So  do you get colours or just French tips?
Monica, There. Here's their card.
Ross, Thanks.  Hey  I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video...  florist. 
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, Hey Pheebs!
Monica, Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe, Oh  you won't believe who moved back to town.
Monica, I know  Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!
Chandler, Who's Amanda?
Monica," She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  ""Monica  darling! It's Amanda calling!"""
Chandler, Are you trying to do a British accent?
Monica,   Chandler gets pedicures!
Chandler, Just so I know  how many more of those can I expect?
Phoebe," You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  ""Oh  so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!"" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile  don't call me on my mo-Bile!"""
Monica, I know  and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.
Phoebe," Oh  I know! ""Oh...I slept with Billy Joel"". All right  who hasn't?"
Monica, Oh  what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!
Phoebe, Ugh  Let's just cut her out!
Monica, What?
Phoebe, Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Monica, Oh  I guess we could try that  but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?
Chandler, No  had it done to me though. Feels good !
Ross, Well... I like how you look  what are you?
Ross, Two  I think a two.
Ross, Spray  count  pat  then turn  spray  count and pat.
Ross, Well  I have a PhD  so... 
Ross, One Mississipi  two Mississipi  Three Mis... WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!!  
Ross, You sprayed my front twice!
Ross, No  I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Ross, Mississippilesly?  Well  how bad is it?
Ross, So  how dark is it gonna get?
Ross, I'm a four?
Ross,  Really!
Ross,  Ok!
Ross, Wait  wait a minute  there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?  Ah  oh  ah!  Ah!  The same thing happened again!
Ross,  I'm an eight!
Rachel, Thanks for dinner.
Joey, I thought you paid.  Ha  guess we won’t be going back there!
Rachel, So.
Joey, Yeah.
Joey, Hey what do you say  we move this onto the likes of the couch?
Rachel, I say ‘cheesy line’  but ok.
Joey, What’s the matter?
Rachel, I am sorry  I don’t know  I am sorry  I don’t know why I did that!
Rachel, Ok  so sorry.
Rachel, I am sorry! Again... I don't know  I don’t know what happened  I must be nervous!
Joey, I don’t get it  Chandler loved it!
Rachel, Ok  ok  ok. I promise  I promise  I promise  I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.
Joey, Ok.
Joey,  Uh  was that good for you?
Monica,  No  no  don’t get it. Let the machine pick up.
Phoebe, Oh  yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Monica, It could be Amanda!
Phoebe, Oh  you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Monica, You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!
Phoebe, Ok  don’t hold thy breath!
Chandler, Hello? Is someone on the line?
Chandler, Hang on  she’s right here.  Someone's on the phone  for ya.
Monica, We weren’t picking up  it’s Amanda!
Chandler,  I get pedicures!
Monica, Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night?  Ok  Phoebe and I will see you then!
Phoebe, Why  why  why didn’t you just say no!
Monica, Well  I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!
Phoebe,  Fine  fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
Monica, And you would?
Phoebe, I did!
Joey, Rach  you sure you wanna do this?
Rachel, Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird  it’s you  and it’s me  it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Joey, Ok. Well  how  how can we make it easier?
Rachel, Ok  let’s work from the top down!  Just work the bra  Joe!
Joey, Ok  yeah  got it.
Joey, This thing welded shut?!
Rachel, Okay.
Joey, All right  turn around  I got to get a look at this thing.
Rachel, Oh!
Rachel, Ow!
Joey, Sorry!
Rachel, Well this is romantic!
Joey, I'm sorry!  This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one  and it popped open! I blame your bra!
Rachel, It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
Joey, Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
Rachel, Ok well  well I'm really  I'm sorry about that Joey  but do you think that maybe on some level  you don't want to take off my bra?
Joey,  NAH! I don't have another level!!
Chandler, Hold on! There is something different.
Ross, I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Chandler, Was that place... The Sun?
Ross, Oh! And it gets worse! 
Chandler, Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
Monica, How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth  you count to five and you turn around!!
Ross,  How do you count to five?
Monica, One Two Three...
Ross,  Damnit! 
Rachel,  oooh! Oh oh!
Ross,  I Know!
Rachel, oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
Chandler, How was your date with Joey?
Rachel, Well  it was good.. until we got back to our apartment  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Chandler, You didn't like that?
Rachel, Well  it wasn't just me  alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Monica, Wow  really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Rachel, I do not know what's wrong with us  I mean  we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
Monica, Well  you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Rachel,  Ok  that's true. That's true  we can do this. You're right  you're right  we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Joey, Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
Rachel,  No need!! Problem solved  we are powering through .
Monica,  Chandler  stop! It is not going to pop open!
Chandler,  You don't know! 
Monica, Hey Phoebe!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Is Amanda here yet?
Phoebe, No.
Monica,  Oh good. Good  look I'm so sorry  for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.
Phoebe, Oh! Well  what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Monica, Well  what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?
Phoebe,  Are you kidding  I love it!
Phoebe, Hi!
Monica, Hi!
Monica,  Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...
Phoebe, Musty!
Monica, When were we not friends?
Monica, Ehm  we were friends in 1992.
Monica,  You were going to cut me out?
Phoebe, Well...kinda.
Monica, Oh My God!
Phoebe," Yeah well  in America you're just an ""ass""."
Monica,  Hello? Chandler  what's wrong?  Oh my God  are you alright?  Yeah  I'll be right there.  I'm so sorry  but Chandler was in a car accident. 
Phoebe,  Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Monica, Nope! 
Joey,  Hey!
Rachel, Hey! Got champagne?
Joey, Yes ma'am  ready to Power through!
Rachel, Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket  the phone is off the hook  and in the interest of powering through ...
Joey, Uh! 
Rachel, Ok  Sexy  sexy  very sexy  sexy.  Alright! Lets do it!
Joey, Ok  you're scaring me a little bit.
Rachel, Oh! Get over it soldier  we've gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
Joey, Oh! yeah!
Rachel, You like that?  Let's take this into high gear 
Joey, uh uh!
Rachel, Yeah baby  I'll show you how we do it!
Joey, No  no  no! You kneed me in my misters!
Rachel, What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Joey,  Soldier down!
Monica, We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
Chandler, If she asks  I protested a little  but ok!
Phoebe, Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica  can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Monica, I have nothing to say to you.
Phoebe, Please  Monica? In the hall?
Chandler, Well  aren't you a treat.
Monica, I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe  why?
Phoebe, It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy  okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
Monica, I'm still all those things!
Phoebe, You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Monica,  I am scrappy.
Phoebe, Exactly! Look  no matter what I tried to do  I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out  you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Monica, It's because I'm scrappy.
Phoebe, Yeah  you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in  because I don't know what I would do without you.
Monica, I won't know what I would do without you.
Monica, Well  I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance  I guess we should do the same for Amanda.
Phoebe, Yeah  I guess you're right.
Ross, I'm gonna stop you right there  Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time  huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Ross, Wait a minute  there's two sets of nozzles  which one is it?
Ross, Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Ross, OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Rachel, What is the matter with us?
Joey, Well  I know what's the matter with me.
Rachel, No  I mean with us  you know. I mean  is it supposed to be this... difficult?
Joey, I don't know.
Chandler, That fake British woman is a real bitch  but she sure can dance... Hey!
Rachel, Hi! Hey  listen  can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up  was it weird going from friends to... more than that?
Chandler, Kinda... you know  sneaking around  having to hide from you guys...
Rachel, No  no  no... No  I mean... se-x-u-ally...
Joey, Yeah  was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Chandler, Actually  no. No  it felt right. You know  it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Chandler, I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well  I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Rachel, Well  just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.
Joey, Yeah  yeah... Absolutely. I mean  just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Rachel, Right  totally.
Joey, Yeah  so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Rachel, Yeah  and if doesn't work  then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.
Joey, That's a... pla-an.
Joey,  Wow... I did not see this coming.
Rachel, I know.
Joey, I don't get it. I mean  I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Rachel, Hmmm... Me too...
Rachel, I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?
Joey, I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Rachel, Aah... I bet you're right.
Joey, So...
Rachel, Yeah.
Joey, I love ya.
Rachel, Love you too... Alright  I'm going to bed.
Joey, Yeah  me too.
Joey, Ooh  yeah  I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Chandler, Dude  it's Chandler. Let me in.
Ross, Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Chandler, I know  I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Ross, Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Ross, Dude  you're not tanned.
Chandler, No  I just had to get a picture of this.
Chandler, I see you later!
Monica,  Hey guys!
Chandler, Honey  I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
Monica, That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
Rachel, Wait  you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Ross, Yeah!
Rachel, We're having a party.
Monica, Well  can't you just have the party when we get back?
Ross, No.
Rachel, No  that day... that won't be her real birthday!
Chandler, Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
Ross, C'mon you guys  this is really important to us.
Monica, Well  I'm sorry  but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know  to reconnect... emotionally.
Chandler, There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Rachel, Well  can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Ross, Yeah  we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Rachel, And I mean  you know  you guys... This is a big deal. I mean  how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Monica, All right  we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
Chandler, Fine  but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Monica, Believe me  that is not why we won't be doing that!
Rachel, You know Pheebs  when I was little  on my birthday  my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house  and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
Phoebe, Oooh  I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids  on our birthday  our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
Ross,  Hey guys!
Ross, Hey  I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Rachel, Oh  good  good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
Phoebe, Oh  COOL!! Wow  it's like a time capsule!
Ross, Yeah!
Phoebe, Oh  just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
Ross, That's the hope! So  is Emma awake yet?
Rachel, Oh no  it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
Ross, Ah  and where is Joey?
Rachel, I said it's still nap time.
Ross,  Hey  there is uncle Joey!
Joey, Hey!
Ross, Hey  say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
Joey, 18  uh? 
Ross, Joey  NO!
Joey, What  what!? it's for her hot friends!
Ross, When they see this you'll be 52!
Joey, And starting to think about settling down!
Rachel, Hey Joey  will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
Joey, I'd love to! Yeah!
Joey,  We were supposed to bring presents?
Phoebe, Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Joey, Oh  yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Phoebe, Joey  it's a birthday party.
Joey," Yeah  but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!"
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Rachel, Oh  she's still napping
Chandler, Oh  sure  she was probably up all night  excited about the party she knows is happening.
Rachel, Look  I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you  but it really is to us  ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
Monica, All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Rachel, No really  she didn't sleep well last night  so we can't wake her up.
Monica, Are you freaking kidding me  Green?
Ross,  Hey!
Monica, So glad you came!
Ross,  There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Joey, Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Joey, Oh man  this is great  uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Monica, I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Chandler, I know  what are we gonna do?
Monica, I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Chandler, I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Joey, Hey Pheebs  you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song  maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
Phoebe, So you’re gonna... hit on her?
Joey, No  no  no! My talents as an actor!
Phoebe, Oh!
Joey, You know  I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
Phoebe, Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Joey, Hey  I think Emma might like it!
Rachel, Oh! Emma might like what?
Joey, Um  my present!
Rachel, What did you get her?
Joey, Actually we prepared performances.
Phoebe, Separate performances.
Joey, But equally real!
Rachel, Well  this sounds like fun! Well  you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap  so would you mind performing them once now?
Phoebe, Sure  yeah!
Joey,  O K.
Rachel,  All right  let’s get this party started  huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Ross, Oh  great!
Phoebe,  Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
Joey, Hey  I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
Rachel, So  Joey  what are you gonna do for us?
Joey, I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
Rachel, Oh  ok  which one?
Joey, Uh  why  it’s a...  one of her favorites  uh   “Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression” eesh!  “Love you forever”. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed  in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth  back and forth  back and forth  and while she held him she sang “I’ll love you forever  I’ll like you for always  as long as I'm living  my baby you’ll be”. . And while he rocked her  he sang “I’ll love you forever  I’ll like you for always  as long as I'm living  my baby you’ll be”.
Rachel,  Wow! That was amazing!
Ross, Thank you so much for that gift!
Ross, Amazing... amazing.
Rachel, Oh  Phoebe  I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
Phoebe, That’s right  I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift  than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna  he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
Rachel, Is that it?
Phoebe, No  of course not! I also  you know  prepared a reading . “Sex and the single mother.  Finding your G-spot.
Rachel, Ross  um  don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
Ross, Sure.
Rachel, Oh  you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey  Corino’s.
Monica, Oh my God  that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Rachel, Well  anyway  they make these great novelty cakes  in all different shapes  and if you give them a photo  they’ll copy it in icing!
Monica, Oh  did you do a picture of Emma?
Rachel, Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Ross, Uh  Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Rachel, Ross  what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
Rachel, Why you guys this isn't funny  all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Ross, I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
Ross, Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis  so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
Rachel, Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back  I don't even want it in my home...  Joey  don't touch it!!
Joey, I'm so confused!
Rachel,  Yes  yes. I still want my daughters picture  but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake  chocolate frosting with nuts!
Chandler, To be fair this one does have nuts.
Ross, Hey Mon  that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
Monica, Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair  'till I dropped the key!
Ross, Well  you know what? While we're waiting  you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday  huh?  Ok!
Chandler, Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
Monica, We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler  by the way. You may not recognize us  because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
Chandler, We used to be married  but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. 
Monica, Ross  Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go  if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
Phoebe, And you know  I have a massage client soon.
Ross, You guys  just please.. a little bit longer. I promise  Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica  remember.. the frosting? huh?
Monica, Alright  5 more minutes.
Ross,  Hello?  Oh no! What happened?  Ok ok  where are you? . Ok  I'll be right there. 
Chandler, Was that Emma? Is she up?
Ross, No  Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
Phoebe, Well  if you're leaving  I'm definitely gonna go.
Monica, No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!
Ross, No  wait ! You guys  no  no  you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Chandler, I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Ross, Joey! You're in charge  ok? You make sure nobody leaves! 
Joey, Got it!  Hey hey hey!  Where do you think you're going?
Chandler, To the bathroom!
Joey, Alright  well the rest of you get comfortable  ok  because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute  there is a window in there!
Phoebe, Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! 
Chandler,  What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! 
Joey, Well  that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Phoebe, No  it did not.
Joey, No.
Joey, Ok! 
Joey, Nighty-night!
Joey, Bye  bye.
Phoebe, Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Joey, Hey  hey  hey  hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack  he's a great man  he fought for our country.
Monica, No  he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
Joey,  Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. 
Chandler, You do know  I can just turn them the other way around  right?
Joey, Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Joey, Hello?
Joey, Hey! 
Joey,  What audition?
Joey, What? You never said anything about an audition!
Joey, A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.   Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Phoebe, Wh.. what? No wait  you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
Monica, Yeah  and we've paid for a room  that we're supposed to be in right now!
Phoebe, Well  oh  ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok  and as the person who realized that  I get to go!
Monica, No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Joey, Oh! I got it! Ok  everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
Monica,  Ok  ten.
Joey, Okay  Monica picks ten  I call nine! Anyone else?
Phoebe, No  lets just draw straws.
Joey, Or.. we could flip a coin  and then multiply the..
Chandler, I'm begging you stop.
Joey, Right.
Monica, Ok  how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race  and whoever comes in last  stays!
Phoebe,  Yeah!! Let's do that!
Chandler,  That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Monica, Everybody get your toys! 
Phoebe, Ok! I want the dolphin!
Chandler, Thats a bear.
Phoebe, I'm too excited!
Monica, Phoebe  you get the bear  uhm  Joey  you get the robot  and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok  and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes in last  stays!
Joey, Ok  ladies and gentlemen  wind your toys! 
Chandler, Ok  on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Phoebe, Go! Go!
Joey, Come on robot!
Monica,  What are you barking at?
Monica, Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
Chandler, I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Joey, Way to go robot!
Phoebe, Good job Alan!
Joey, Hey  good race you guys.
Phoebe, Yeah  see you later!
Monica, No! No  no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well  our dog never crossed the finish line  so technically...
Chandler, They left.
Rachel,  No  there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright  well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can.  Bye...
Ross, RACHEL!
Rachel, OOH! God! Sorry!
Ross,  I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Rachel, Emma's awake.
Ross, Yeah?
Rachel, I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Ross, Hey  maybe I can fix that  you know. Try to turn it into something else. 
Rachel, Oh  why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Ross, Rach  she's not going to remember this.
Rachel,"  I guess... Oh  I just had such an idea of what this day would be like  you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!!  They have to learn!"
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, What?
Ross, It's not bad.
Rachel,  Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
Ross, Well  I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
Rachel, Well  I'm very impressed.
Ross, Some can sing  some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Monica, Now another way to organise your stuffed animals  is by size.
Chandler, I'm sorry  is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Monica, Game?
Chandler, Emma  you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old  that's little.
Chandler, Ooh! That's my girl!
Monica, That's how old you are.
Chandler, Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Monica,  Ooh  I want one...
Chandler, Me too...
Chandler, There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Monica, ...and head to Canada!
Chandler, I was kidding.
Monica, I wasn't. Let's get going!
Phoebe, Hey  are Ross and Rachel back?
Chandler, No  not yet.
Phoebe, Oh good  I didn't miss the party.
Monica, What about your massage client?
Phoebe, I just felt so bad  missing this. So I just slipped him a little something  you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours  it will be alright.
Joey, Okay  if Ross and Rachel ask  I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
Joey,  I've been here the whole time!
Ross, Joey  we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Rachel, I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Chandler, Hey  guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Rachel, What?
Chandler, Emma  how old are you? How old are you today? 
Rachel, Oh! Emma  that's right! You're that many!
Ross, Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach  this means...
Rachel,  NO  no science camp!
Ross, Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Rachel, Oh!... Oh and Emma  look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
Monica, Thanks!
Ross, Okay  here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well  blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Chandler, Let's do it  come on!
Ross, What's wrong? Are you okay?
Rachel, Oh yeah  nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
Phoebe,  Hey  you made it into a bunny.
Joey, What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Rachel, Okay.
Ross, Okay  you ready?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, A-a-and... record.
Rachel, Okay.  Hi Emma. Well  your first birthday is over  and it was really...
Phoebe,  Go  go  go Alan! Run you  hairy bastard!
Rachel, You know  I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Joey, Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Rachel, I've never given her a cookie. Have you?
Joey, No! No... and  for the record  I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Monica, Hey Rach  the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Rachel, Of course  I'd be honored!
Chandler, Thanks!
Monica, Thank you!
Joey, U-U-Um  I think there's been an oversight.
Chandler, Joey  we would've asked you  we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Monica," Yeah  it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with the words""."
Joey, Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
Monica, Clearly we were wrong.
Joey, I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys  ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby  you know  and I would love to help you get one.
Monica, You know what? Then  Joey  we want you to do it.
Joey," Thank you! Alright  let me see how I'm gonna start... ""Dear baby adoption decider people..."""
Chandler, So excited about your letter!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Monica, Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Phoebe, Yes  I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Rachel, OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date  your first kiss  first time you had sex...
Phoebe, YEAH!
Chandler, So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Phoebe, Uh-uh. Ehm  a Knicks game.
Joey, Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
Phoebe, Hey  you know what  I've never had a one-year anniversary before  so no matter where we go  I'm wearing something fancy pants  and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
Monica, You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
Chandler, That's where people make number two!!
Ross, Hey...
Ross,  Oh...   Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Ross,  B  B  B  B  B!
Ross, Well  it had some good ideas  take off your shirt.
Ross, Damnit!
Ross,  Hi Amy!
Ross, Still sharp as a tack!
Ross,  Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Ross,  Yes  yes  you did.
Ross, Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!
Rachel, Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh!  Wow! You remember Joey?
Joey, That's right  yeah.
Joey, Always nice to meet a fan!
Rachel, So now  what are you doing here?
Rachel,  Oh sorry  hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
Ross, Ehm... Her name is Emma.
Ross, What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!
Ross,  Oh my God!
Joey, I know  she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Ross, What... what you working on?
Joey,  Oh  Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything  so...
Ross, Why don't you use your Thesaurus?
Joey, What did I just say?
Ross, Watch.  Here  you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Joey," Oh my God  that's great! I'm smart!! No  no  I'm...  ""brainy  bright  clever""  I love this thing! Look out ladies  Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!"
Rachel, God!
Rachel, Oh  I know  isn't she?
Rachel, All right. What's your news  Amy?
Rachel, What? Oh my God! To who?
Rachel, A-And??
Rachel, No  what's he like?
Rachel, Yeah.
Rachel, Huh... wow  so he's gotta be...
Rachel, Sweety  I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...
Rachel, Oh... sit down  sit down. Oh  honey  you know  I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?
Rachel, Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm  so but anyway  listen  not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever  ever made. Honey  you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there  somewhere. Someone that is your age  that is smart  that is fun and that you care about!
Rachel, Ok.
Rachel, Ok  let’s keep talking.
Phoebe, Excuse me  anniversary. Excuse me  anniversary. . Uhm  sir  could you move your nachos... they’re in my seat. It's my anniversary.  Here we are! . Can’t believe it's been a whole year!
Phoebe, ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!
Phoebe, YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND  YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED   IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!
Phoebe, Oh how lame... oh  it’s so tacky  and impersonal.
Phoebe, Oh  it’s the worst way to propose!
Joey, Hey  finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very  very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.
Chandler,  I don’t... uh... understand.
Joey,  Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
Monica,  It doesn’t make any sense.
Joey, Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!
Chandler, On every word?
Joey, Yep!
Monica, Alright  what was this sentence originally? 
Joey, Oh  ‘They are warm  nice  people with big hearts’.
Chandler, And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Joey, Yeah  yeah and hey  I really mean it  dude.
Monica, Hey Joey  I don’t think we can use this.
Joey, Why not?
Monica, Well  because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey  why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Chandler, You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus  just write from here   your full sized aortic pump.
Rachel, Amy  hi!
Rachel, Oh  good for you!
Rachel, Yes you are! Oh  I am so proud of you!
Rachel, But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Joey, Ah  look who’s back!  Why do you have bags? RACH  WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Joey, What?
Joey, You slept out here?
Rachel, Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron  get off!’
Joey, But uhm  we're getting rid of her  right? Rach  please tell me we’re getting rid of her.
Rachel, Joey  I can’t do that!
Joey," Oh  come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  ""Uoh oh oh  a moment on the lips  forever on the hips!"" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!"
Rachel, Well Joey  uhm look  I know that she’s difficult  but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
Joey, 'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?
Rachel, No  it's just... look  you know  when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled  self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Joey, Yeah  Monica made us!
Rachel, Well  uhm... whatever  I have really appreciated it  'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See  I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience  but that’s ok.
Joey, Yeaah.
Rachel, Amy  that’s what I was supposed to wear today  that’s why I hung it on the door.
Rachel, Amy  you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and  you know  talk about your future.
Joey,  I’M CURVY  AND I LIKE IT!
Phoebe, Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.
Chandler, I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Monica, Oh  well  I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
Ross, Seriously?
Chandler, Word!
Phoebe, Well  mine was worse than that.
Rachel, Well  what happened?
Phoebe, We were at the game  and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...
Rachel, Oh  that is so tacky.
Phoebe, Well  that’s what I said  but it turns out  Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!
Monica, Oh my God  Mike was gonna propose?
Rachel, Phoebe  that’s huge!
Ross, Well  do you wanna marry him?
Phoebe, Yeah  I really do! Yes  but  after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me  I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean  I said no in Barbados and now this!
Chandler, She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?
Monica, Maybe you don't need him to propose to you  maybe you can propose to him!
Phoebe, Oh  I don't know  I don't know  isn't that a little desperate?
Monica, I proposed to Chandler!  Alright  moving on...
Chandler, Oh  I don't think it was desperate  I think it was amazing!
Monica, Thank you.
Phoebe,  Well  do you think I should propose?
Rachel, I think it could be kind of great!
Ross, Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Phoebe, Ok  ok  so how should I do it?
Monica, How about at a game  on the big screen?
Rachel,  Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? 
Monica, What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to  plus he'd never suspect it!
Phoebe, Yeah  that does make sense. Ok  now  would... would you two  like that?
Chandler, Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Rachel,  Oh! That's interesting  since she died seven years ago!!
Rachel,  Hello?  Oh  it's our nanny!  Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok  bye!   That's Molly  she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
Ross, No  I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Rachel, Menstrual cramps.
Ross, I don't think that's what this is.
Rachel,  Can any of you watch Emma?
Monica, No  sorry sweety..
Phoebe, No  I've got work and then I'm proposing..
Rachel,  Great  shoot  what are we gonna do?
Rachel,  Well  actually...
Ross,  Well  can I talk to you for a sec.?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, Um  I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Rachel, Why not?
Ross, Well  for one thing  she keeps calling her Ella!
Rachel,  Wha.. well  Ella's a nice name!
Ross, Fine  we'll call the next one Ella.
Rachel,  Wha... the next one?
Ross,  Okay  um... I don't want her watching our baby.
Rachel, Ross  I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Ross, I... I don't know..
Rachel, Ross  I'm telling you  she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
Rachel, Absolutely.
Chandler, Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Joey, Great  I'm finished! In fact  I just dropped it off at the agency.
Monica, You dropped it off?
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Joey, No can do amigo. No  I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. 
Monica, You hand-wrote it?
Joey, Yeah  and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! 
Monica, Oh my God  oh my God  that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No  we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Chandler, It's ok  it's ok. You know what?  I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. 
Monica, Okay good.
Chandler,  Hello  this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter  and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .
Monica, Ugh  we're screwed  aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Chandler,  They loved it.
Monica, What?
Chandler, They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
Monica,  They thought Joey was a child?
Chandler, She guessed 8  9  based on his drawings.
Monica, Hey  what did you guys do today?
Chandler, That sounds like fun.
Rachel,  Hey! Hi  how's my girl?
Rachel,  Yeah!
Rachel,  You pierced her ears!?
Rachel, You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
Chandler, I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!
Rachel, Oh my God  Oh my God  here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Rachel, Ugh. 
Ross, Hey guys.
Ross, Hey Emma. Oh  why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Rachel, Nah  I don't really want her to see.
Ross, Why not?
Monica, Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Chandler, Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
Ross, Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Ross,  What?
Rachel, Nothing.
Ross,  Hi!  What... . Please tell me those are clip-ons.
Rachel, Oh  they're real!
Ross, Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
Rachel, I know  I know  and you were right Ross.  You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Monica, I'm a cool  fun aunt!
Chandler, Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
Rachel, I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Rachel, Oh yeah? Since when?
Rachel,  What?
Ross, That's not a thing!
Rachel,  Babies don't care if they're slim.
Ross,  Amy  I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Ross,  No more falafel for you!
Phoebe, Uhuh  uhuh... 
Phoebe, I'm not. I'm praying.  Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor!  Where... where are you going?
Phoebe, Well  I think you should wait.
Phoebe, Well  if you don't... if you don't hold it in  you don't get all the nutrients.
Phoebe, Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? 
Phoebe, That's not very enlightened!
Phoebe, Hey  hey!  Boo us? Boo you!
Joey,  Hello? Yeah  this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh  hi! Well  I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now...  Okay  bye bye.   She was nice!
Rachel, Joey  get Amy's bags  she is moving out!
Joey, Whoo-hoo! 
Rachel, You put holes in my baby's ears!
Rachel,  I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Rachel, Excuse me?
Rachel,  Joey  where are those bags?
Joey,  She has a lot of crap!
Rachel,  Seriously?
Rachel, Hips or thighs?
Rachel,  Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
Rachel,  Oh  I can give you that.
Rachel, Yeah. I just  I kept trying to make you a better person  but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Rachel, Did you just say Emma?
Phoebe, That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike  obviously you have balls.
Phoebe,  I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose  I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether  you know  it is in a basketball game  or in sky writing  or you know  like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.
Phoebe, It's in the cake  isn't it?
Phoebe, What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry  I'm sorry!
Phoebe, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Wait! Oh wait!  Oh no! 
Phoebe, Uh-huh! 
Phoebe, Yes!
Phoebe, I love you more!
Rachel, So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?
Rachel, That's shocking!
Phoebe,  Hey...
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Pheebs  what's wrong?
Phoebe, Oh  I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!
Rachel, My God!
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Congratulations! Wow!!
Ross, So  did he get on one knee  did he have a speech prepared  or  did he cry?  Yeah  big surprise  I like proposals!
Phoebe, Well  it was really sweet  and like the most romantic thing ever.
Joey, Well  hey! Well...  Here's to Phoebe  who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...  I wanna say Mike?  To Phoebe and Mike!
Phoebe, Thank you!  Oh  and I have something for you!
Rachel, Mmh-mmh!
Phoebe, It's  yes  my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Rachel, Oh  Pheebs  baby  that's nice but  you know what  I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
Phoebe, I would  but you're the last one.
Rachel,"  GIVE ME THE BOOK!  Pablo Diaz  Brady Smith  huh  ""Guy-in-van""?"
Phoebe, Oh  my first love!
Rachel, Oh!
Monica, What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Phoebe, Dead.  Oh  it's OK  no  he was old  yeah! And he lived a full life  he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
Chandler, Hey  I'm sorry  I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Rachel, Phoebe  isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Phoebe,  Oh yes  they are.
Chandler,  Hey honey!
Joey,  Hi sweetie!
Chandler, Is Monica not here?
Joey, No.
Chandler, Oh  then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Joey, Cool!
Chandler, Yeah  and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell  you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!
Joey, That's great! Hey  can you cast me in it?
Chandler, Oh... I don't know  I really don't think you're right for the part.
Joey, What do you mean? I can do anything  I'm a chameleon! Huh?  I'm old!  I'm tired!  Hey  I'm hot  I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
Chandler, First of all. Bravo. Uh  but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
Joey," I can do that!  ""Hello  I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."" Oh  what's the product?"
Chandler, Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
Joey,  I'm cold!
Ross,  Hey!
Ross, Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint  he's looking right at you.
Ross, Oh  I'm so excited  I mean  apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants  included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!
Ross," Well  ok  it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it  I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the ""Paleontology Review""! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there  without people raising serious questions about my work!"
Ross, Yeah. Why?
Ross, Your ex-boyfriend?
Ross, So  your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow  your new boyfriend is screwed!
Ross, Well  if you think it would help.
Ross, Ok  now  is there anything I can do to... you know  butter him up? Anything he really likes?
Ross, We'll see how dinner goes.
Phoebe,  Hey!
Monica, Hey  you wanna go to see a movie?
Phoebe, Well  I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff  so Mike could move in.
Monica, Oh  right.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Monica, Oh  well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Phoebe, Oh  it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?
Monica, Uh  Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Phoebe, A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Monica, Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!
Phoebe, Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh  I know!! Oh  you should take her!
Monica,  Well  I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Phoebe, Why  you don't like her?
Monica, Well  of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But  you know  I think that you're giving up too easy  honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Phoebe, Really? You think?
Monica," Absolutely! Yes  you say to him ""I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her  she means too much to me!"""
Phoebe, Ok  I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh  wait  oh I just realized... if I do that  that means you don't get her.
Monica, Damn it  I did not think this through!
Chandler, Hey you guys.
Rachel, Hi!
Joey, Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Chandler, Joe  I told you  you're just not right for the part.
Joey, What do you mean? Rach  don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
Rachel, I'm sorry  this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Chandler, Joe...
Joey, Just watch it  and if you don't like it  you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Chandler, Fine!
Joey, Thank you. 
Chandler, Work  Joe!
Joey, Damn it! 
Joey, Just pass it to your boss!
Chandler, He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him  my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!
Rachel, Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it  but your bosses didn't. Then that way  you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Chandler, That's good! I liked it  they didn't.  Joey  for God's sake  go to work! .
Ross, I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?
Ross, Well  I... I am having a good hair day.
Ross, I'm ok.
Ross, It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work  I mean  that Nobel prize   whoooo! I mean  I have to tell you that  you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
Ross, No  but  it's  you know  it's just a funny image  you know  the two of you  in this restaurant  with... tzz-zzz  mmm.
Ross, Ok well  I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.
Ross, See  there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
Ross, What?
Ross," Did you just say ""break up with Charlie""?"
Ross, Kind of inappropriate  don't you think?
Ross, Are you serious?
Ross, No!
Phoebe, Hi! Sorry  I'm late.
Monica, Hey  how did it go with Mike  is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Phoebe, No  he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is  Gladys is yours!
Monica, Wow  what's the bad news!
Rachel, Who's Gladys?
Phoebe, Oh  she's that work of art I made  you know  with the woman coming out of the frame.
Rachel,  Oh  and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Phoebe, Oh  I didn't know you wanted her too!
Monica, Huh!
Rachel, Well  I mean  sure  of course. But... you already gave that to Monica  so...
Monica, You know  I would give her up  for you.
Rachel, No  I couldn't let you do that.
Monica, But I want to.
Rachel, But I don't want you to.
Monica, But I insist!
Rachel, But I insist harder!
Phoebe, Girls  girls  stop  ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads  she's Rachel's  tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica  she's yours!
Monica, No  that landed in your food!
Rachel,  No  no  that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
Chandler, Hey Joe!
Joey, What's up?
Chandler, Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
Joey,  Oh.
Chandler,  I'm sorry man.
Joey,  But  ehm... you watched the tape?
Chandler,  Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But  ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!
Joey,  You didn't watch the tape.
Chandler,  What!? Of course I did!
Joey, Look  it's one thing not to cast me  but to lie to me?
Chandler, I'm not lying to you  I watched it!
Joey, Well  you lied again! 
Chandler, I watched it!
Joey, Keep going Pinocchio!
Chandler,   I did!
Joey,  No you didn't! 
Chandler,  I'm telling you  I watched the tape. 
Rachel, Did you watch the tape?
Chandler, No!
Ross,  I guess!
Ross,  What? I... I... 
Ross,  May 12th?
Ross,  Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Ross, Wha...? Wait  wait  wait  just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Ross,"  um... I've never heard of a ""Boscodictiasaur""."
Ross,  Ok.  B - O - S ...
Ross, Oh come on!!
Chandler, I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
Rachel, But you are a liar.
Chandler, What did I just say?
Joey, You still here?
Chandler, Yes  and I have to say  I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Joey, Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there  ok? First  you lied  right? Then  you lied about lying  ok? Then you lied about lying about lying  ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...   Stop lying!
Chandler, Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
Joey,  You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? 
Rachel, Well  this is going well. 
Joey,  Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape  ok?  If you had seen what was on this tape  believe me  you would have some comments. Alright  now remember  I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. 
Joey,  And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
Chandler, He really is a chameleon.
Phoebe,  Well  Gladys say hello to your new home! 
Monica,  Oh  my!
Rachel,  Wow!  Oh  she's so nice and big! Oh  Monica  where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? 
Monica,  I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
Rachel, Well  hey! How about right above the TV? . That way  it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
Phoebe,  Yeah  yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.
Monica,  I like that poster!
Phoebe, Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?
Rachel,  Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Monica,  Are you still here?
Ross, Oh hi! Hello! Uh  have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname  perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?
Ross,  No! Stop!
Ross,  Really?
Ross, I have to break up with Charlie?
Ross, You're crazy.
Ross, Crazy!
Ross,  Get out! 
Rachel, O-oh my God!
Joey,  What?
Rachel, Joey  what... is... this...thing... doing here?
Joey, I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Rachel, Joey  we're not keeping this!
Joey, But it's an original Buffay...
Rachel, Alright  fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Joey, Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Rachel, Well  legend has it Joey  that... she comes alive when you're asleep.
Rachel, She climbs out of the frame  and then drags her half-a-body across the floor  just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand  she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.
Joey, GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Monica, Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Rachel, Well  why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. 
Monica, No  too late. You can't give it back! 
Rachel, Yes I can! 
Monica, No you can't. She's yours!
Rachel, She's yours!
Monica, SHE'S YOURS!
Rachel, She's yours!
Phoebe, Hey! 
Rachel, She's mine!
Monica, She's m-i-i-ne!
Rachel, She's mine!
Monica, She's mine!
Phoebe, You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore.  Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. 
Rachel, I want Gladys!
Monica, She's mine!
Rachel, She's mine!
Monica, She's mine!
Rachel, She's mine!
Chandler, Look  I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise  next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.
Joey, That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Chandler, I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Monica, Oh my God!
Rachel, Excellent!
Joey, Now  what do you say?
Chandler, Lying is wrong!
Joey, And?... AND?
Chandler, I'm a pretty little girl.
Phoebe, I knew it!
Ross, Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Ross, No I didn't  and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
Ross, Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant  because I wouldn't give you up.
Ross," Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review  who was the voice of ""Underdog""?"
Ross, If you don't believe me  let's go talk to him  okay? I'm telling you  he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Ross, Oh  I'm sorry  no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?
Ross, Damnit!
Ross, I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me  about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Ross, No  no  no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes  and tell her the truth.
Ross, Too little  too late  Benji!
Ross,  No!
Ross, What?
Ross, or...
Ross, Sweetie  this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Ross, Okay  that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Joey, Gladys?
Rachel, Ha ha ha  third time this week. Man  this does not get old.
Joey, You're mean!
Rachel, Oh  don't be such a baby!
Ross, Hey you guys!
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Hey  what are you doing?
Chandler, That's funny  we were doing the same thing!
Ross, Yeah!
Phoebe, It's really crazy! The hall  the dress  the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler, Yeah it is really pricey. I mean  I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
Phoebe, So what did you two do about it?
Chandler, It was pretty simple actually  I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions  wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross, There's no way around it Pheebs  you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
Ross, Yeah  and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
Phoebe, But really  it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Phoebe, Yeah! Now  how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
Ross, I've got to say you guys  that's an incredible gesture!
Chandler,  Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Ross, No  no  no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset.  But maybe the time after that!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, What's going on?
Chandler, Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Monica,  We?
Chandler, You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Joey, Hey  is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
Chandler, Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Monica, And it has to go perfectly  because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
Joey, Hey  maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
Chandler,  Little people?
Joey,  Celebrity.
Monica, Ok  so I think I'm just about done here  unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere  like... porn or cigarettes?
Chandler, What...? NO!
Monica, Chandler?
Chandler,  I don't  and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Monica, Ok  so there's not a magazine under the couch  or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank  or a filthy video in the VCR?
Chandler, I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine  but that tape is not mine.
Monica, It isn't mine!
Joey,  Well  I guess we'll never know whose it is!
Phoebe, Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Phoebe, Well  I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one 
Phoebe, And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Phoebe, Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe, Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Phoebe, Sure  I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Phoebe, Oh  look! And we get these free t-shirts! 
Phoebe, Mhm... it's moist.
Ross,  Hi!
Rachel, Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Ross, Oh  good!
Rachel, Oh hey Ross... Listen  I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Ross, Oh  that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Rachel, Absolutely.
Ross, There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
Rachel, So  uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Ross, Well  I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Rachel, Oh my God  what!?
Ross, Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
Rachel, Ok  look  Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Ross, Be-caaauuuse...
Rachel,  All right  well  if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Ross, Seriously?
Rachel, Yes  I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!
Ross,  And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
Rachel, Ok  fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Ross, Look  I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy  ok? But the swings are perfectly safe  and besides Emma loves them. You know what  you should come with us and you'll see!
Rachel, Ross  those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top  when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Ross, Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look  please  just come on  you know  when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face  I swear you won’t regret it.
Rachel, All right!
Ross, Good  you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children  do you?
Rachel, Irrational  huh? All right  well  I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Ross, Oh  yeah  that’s the same  I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
Monica, Oh my God  the adoption lady is early!
Chandler, Ok  ok  here we go.
Monica, Ok.
Chandler, Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile. 
Phoebe, Hello  is this the creepy residence?
Monica, We’re waiting for the adoption lady  but  hey  I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it  but…
Phoebe, Awe  this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil  I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
Monica, I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
Phoebe, No  no  no  we’re not having a big reception  we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Monica, That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
Phoebe, We  you know  we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party.  This is really nice for you  but  oh  please  I put this on?  And  ow  I look   why  well  radiant.  All right  well  who cares  I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Monica, That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same  whether you do that at the Plaza or  where are you gonna do it?
Phoebe, City Hall.
Monica, Ow!  Oh  that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
Phoebe, It’s ok  it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding 
Monica, Yay!
Chandler, But you already gave all your money to charity!
Phoebe, Well  I’ll just ask for it back!
Chandler, I don’t think you can do that!
Monica, Why not! This is her wedding day  this is way more important than some stupid kids!
Chandler, That’s sweet  honey  but save something for the adoption Lady.
Rachel, Ok  careful.
Ross, Ok.
Rachel, Careful  watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Ross, Rach  she’s got like three hairs!
Rachel, I know  but they’re just so beautiful! Oh  my God  I just pulled one out.
Ross, I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Rachel, Ok.
Rachel, Ok.
Ross, Here we go! 
Rachel, Ok  careful  ok.  Oh  she’s smiling! Oh my God  she does like it!
Ross, See  I told you!
Rachel, Awe!  Oh my God! Looks  she’s a little dare-devil! Oh  let me push  can I push?
Ross, Oh  absolutely!
Rachel, Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera  it’s in the diaper bag.
Ross, Ok!  See? Scared of swings  I bet you feel pretty silly  Ow!
Phoebe, It’s for our wedding day! Right  now  is this guy gay or straight  because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Phoebe, The donation we made earlier  we k…  we w…  we want it back.
Phoebe, Yeah. See  that money was for a big wedding  that we thought we didn’t want  but it turns out we do.
Phoebe, I am sorry. I am  but this wedding is just really important to me.
Phoebe, Hey  that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
Monica, Hi  I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Monica, Would you like something to drink?
Monica, Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
Chandler, Oh  because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well  not actually to death  that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Monica, Ah  thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Monica, Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before
Chandler, But other than that... wholesome  wholesome building.
Chandler, What?
Monica, Really? What is it?
Monica, Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Chandler, Of course it was!
Chandler, RAT BASTARD!
Joey,  Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
Chandler, Oh  it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with
Rachel, Oh  oh Ross  oh my God  are you okay?
Ross, SON OF A BITCH!  (To the
Rachel, Ross  see! I told you  those swings are evil! Alright  that is it. That is
Ross, No! No  no  no  no  okay  it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
Rachel, Ross  c'mon  please. Can we just get out of here  before somebody else gets
Ross, No wait  okay  okay  I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing  okay? And
Rachel,  I know what this is all about... You've always been
Ross, Look  I just think you're an adult  okay? And you should get over your silly
Rachel, Alright fine. I'll do it.
Ross, Good.
Rachel, If you hold a spider.
Ross,  WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Rachel, IF you hold a spider.
Ross, I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again 
Joey, Guys? Everything ok? It's me  Joe...
Chandler,  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Chandler, Oh  just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on
Joey, Guys!?
Monica, Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
Joey, What's going on?
Chandler, WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER  BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Joey, Everything doesn't sound fine!
Chandler, Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Chandler,  You can't make this stuff up!
Phoebe,  Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
Phoebe, Yeah  I really do. You know  I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few
Phoebe, Look  I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Phoebe, And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time  my friend hasn't shot
Monica, Oh  by the way  you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture 
Monica,  Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Chandler, What the hell are you doing?
Joey, Well  you wouldn't let me in  so I thought you were in trouble.
Chandler, Well  we're not.
Joey, But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Chandler, We don't have a code word.
Joey, We don't? We really should. From now on  'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
Monica, So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind
Monica,  What room should we see next?
Chandler, Any room that isn't behind this couch! 
Monica,   Some people don't
Joey,  I did not care for that!
Chandler,  You have to get out of here. You slept with
Joey, Ok  ok! 
Chandler, Ok!
Chandler, What?
Joey, I forgot my bat.
Chandler, And for the last time  we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat! 
Joey,  Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Chandler, I can explain... Joey...
Joey, Uhm... ok... uhm... Well  yeah... You have got some nerve  coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
Joey, Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey  by the way. And don't bother telling me yours  because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Joey, No  no! Don't try to turn this around on me  ok? I'm not some kind of... social work  ok  that you can just... do.
Joey, Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman  smart  funny  we had a really good time  huh? If I had your number  why wouldn't I call you?
Joey, No  no  hey  no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? 
Joey,  NO! I waited a long time  I can't wait anymore... 
Chandler, Oh  that's really ok.
Monica, Yeah  that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Joey, LAURA! 
Phoebe,  We're back!
Phoebe, Yeah  because you know what  it's... it's all about the children.
Phoebe, Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh  alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!
Phoebe, But... but... but we're giving you this!
Phoebe,  Well  this is very generous!
Phoebe, Oh  is that you?
Monica, Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok  goodbye. 
Chandler, Wrong number?
Monica, It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
Chandler, That's great!
Monica, Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
Chandler, Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Rachel, Ok... I got a spider. There were two  I picked the bigger one.
Ross,  Ok...
Rachel, Ok... 
Ross,  This feels perfectly normal. Ok  get on the swing!
Rachel,  Ok... O-k...
Rachel,  Ok...
Rachel, whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Ross, See?
Rachel, A-alright! I can do this.
Ross, There you go! Good for you! And you know what  I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Rachel, That's because he's on your neck.
Ross, Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Rachel, ROSS!
Monica, Hey guys!
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, We need to talk to you about something.
Chandler, Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Phoebe, Hey!
Ross, Are you kidding?
Chandler, Well  it's just with uhm  work and the stress of adoption  we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus  we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
Ross,  That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Chandler, No  no! We made this decision together.
Ross, She's putting words in your mouth!
Joey, Don't you put words in people's mouths  you put turkey in people's mouths!
Rachel, I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Monica, No  it's not!
Rachel, It's not?  When was she born?
Phoebe, Well  personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Monica, Thank you  Pheebs!
Phoebe, Sure. It's just as well... I mean  last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Monica, What? You are way off  lady!
Phoebe, Am I? Really? Am I? Well  why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well  think about it  think about it  you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Monica, That's my favourite kind! Okay  we are doing this!
Chandler, Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Monica, Hey  stay out of this  Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Chandler, We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
Phoebe, Oh  yeah  happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Monica, You guys  I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Phoebe, You're not making the pies yourself?
Monica, No  no  no  I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Rachel, Did you at least win the contest?
Monica, 2 minutes  12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay  I see you guys at 4.
Rachel, Can't wait!
Monica," This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face  last year ""me""!"
Phoebe, Hey Rach.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, What's Emma doing today?
Rachel, Well  let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Phoebe, Well  I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Rachel, Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
Phoebe, Okay  but  well  before you say no  my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Rachel, Oh! Phoebe  all babies are beautiful!
Phoebe,  Oh... okay.
Rachel, Phoebe  just the idea of pitting one baby against another  I mean  you know  and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Rachel, And a thousand dollars.
Rachel, ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please  do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...
Phoebe, Okay  oh  and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Rachel, Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Phoebe, Well  I was thinking...
Rachel, Oh  take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
Phoebe, Yeah!
Monica,  Did someone drop the baton again?
Chandler, Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Monica,  I don't get older. I just get better!
Chandler, You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean  we could be getting a baby soon!
Monica, You don't know that.
Chandler, Somebody is gonna pick us.
Monica, Yeah  but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Chandler, I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you  me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What  he's my favourite author!
Monica, Name one of his books.
Chandler,"  ""The Firm""?"
Monica, Ok  let's see... uhm  okay  the turkey is in the oven  the stuffing is ready...
Chandler, You know  you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Monica, Oh  Chandler  that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Chandler," I'm serious  let me do something  just not the turkey or the stuffing  nothing ""high profile""."
Monica, Ok  let's see... Oh  the cranberry sauce  it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Chandler, Tell me more.
Monica, Okay  I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!! 
Chandler, You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Ross, Hey! Hey  guess what Joey has!
Joey, Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Ross, Dude  I wanted him to guess.
Joey, Oh.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Joey, Yeah  they're great seats too!
Ross, Guess where they are?
Joey, Center ice.
Ross, Did I do something to you?
Chandler, Hmm  the game's at one.
Ross, So?
Chandler, Dinner is at four  we'll never gonna make it back.
Joey, So we'll leave before it's over  we'll be back in time.
Chandler, You say that now  but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Joey, Dude  two times that happened!
Chandler, Look  Monica has been working hard all day  she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place  we shouldn't go!
Ross, He's right  man.
Joey, Right  I guess. Alright  so see you at four.
Chandler, Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Joey, That's some gentle comedy  dude. 
Ross, We're still going at the game  right?
Joey, Yeah!
Ross, Yeah.
Phoebe, Hey.
Rachel, Oh Phoebe  listen. Well  I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there  I don't think he came with a kid!
Phoebe, We can't leave now! There was this one baby  Haley  who was favourite to win and she got croup  so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open  folks!
Rachel, Phoebe  I think... It's just too weird  I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Phoebe, Oh  I know  we should have been more prepared.  It's okay. Now  the way I see it  our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God  they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Rachel, Oh  Phoebe! Come on! You know what  it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go  we got dinner!
Phoebe,  But Emma's got what it takes  she could go all the way!
Rachel, Phoebe  you have to calm down.
Phoebe, Okay. Rachel  the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Rachel, Really?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, You heard them say that?
Phoebe, Yeah!
Rachel, All right  okay. Alright  let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Phoebe, Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Rachel, No  what?
Phoebe, Well  she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Rachel, No Phoebe  I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
Phoebe, Why not!
Rachel, Because I already did!
Joey, Oh  Bob  get off the guy!
Ross, Oh! What a game  huh?
Joey, I know  yeah.
Ross, I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Joey, Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too  but I got to say   I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Ross, Yeah  I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Joey, Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Ross, I know  I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Joey,  Wow  hey  we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now  we'll be late for dinner.
Ross, Oh  but it's a kind game! So we're a little late  you know  the girls will be there  let's stay just for one more goal.
Joey, I don't know...
Ross, One more fight!
Joey, Okay.
Ross, Okay.
Monica, Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Chandler, I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
Joey, How late are we?
Ross, Forty-five minutes.
Joey, Wow 
Ross,  Here!
Joey, Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there  okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! 
Ross, You may want to lose the foam finger!
Joey, Oh  no  no  no  no  no. You just want to put it on your hand!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, Oh!
Joey, You are not at Thanksgiving?
Rachel, No...
Phoebe, No  we're late!
Rachel, What are you doing here!
Ross, We're late too! 
Joey, We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time 
Phoebe, Don't point that thing at me  Tribbiani!
Ross, So  nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Joey, Yeah  where were you!
Ross, Yeah  yeah  what's with the trophy!
Phoebe, Uh  we were at the Spelling Bee!
Rachel, And I won!
Ross, You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Rachel, Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes!
Ross, Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling  New York Division.
Rachel, Yeah. That's me!
Ross, You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Phoebe, And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Joey, Wait a second  wait a second  where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Ross, I can't believe this  she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Rachel, She won a thousand dollars!
Ross, So this is an annual thing?
Joey,  Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Phoebe, You guys  there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Ross, Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Rachel, Well  I don't know  you guys figure it out  I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Joey, All right. Hey Rach  while you're in there  throw something on Alicia Mae.
Phoebe, Alright  what are we gonna say?
Ross, Ooh  we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Phoebe, Oh  good  that's good  but you don't look like you were mugged!
Joey, No. Here 
Ross,  HEY!
Monica, Do you hear something? 
Chandler,  They're out there!
Monica, Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God  I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there  talking!
Chandler,"  Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game!"
Monica,  Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Chandler,  Ross' shirt is torn.
Monica, Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
Rachel, Alright  Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?
Ross, I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Phoebe, We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock  not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or  we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Ross,  That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Rachel, You know what  we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late  we're right on time. 
Ross,  We know you're out there. 
Joey,  Who do you think its from?
Rachel, Oh  God. This is bad. This is so bad.
Ross, Well  let's just go in there and face them.
Phoebe, Well  I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Joey, I hate that thing  it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Rachel, Oh  hey  I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors  and whoever loses goes in first.  Ready? .
Joey,  Ah-haah! I win!!
Ross, What is that?
Joey, That's fire. Beats everything.
Phoebe, Oh  really? Does it beat water balloon? .
Joey, Ooh! Well played  Phoebe Buffay  well played.
Rachel, Alright  enough  enough  come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
Phoebe, It's locked.
Ross," Wha...? Oh sure  now they lock it  but when they're having sex on the couch  its like: ""Come on in  my butt is surprisingly hairy""."
Rachel, Alright  come on...  Alright  you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in  so we can have dinner together.
Monica, No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Chandler, Yeah  and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?
Monica,  Nothing. It's fine.
Chandler,  Oh thank God!
Ross, Come on you guys  we're sorry  alri...? Our subway broke down.
Chandler,  That's a lie  you went to the game  I can see Joey's hand.
Ross,  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! 
Rachel, You guys  come on  it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now  please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. 
Joey, I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. 
Monica, That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
Ross, How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Joey,  WATER BALLOON! 
Phoebe, What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Rachel,  Oh  I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Phoebe, Oh yeah!
Monica, Hey  you touch that and you will be sorry.
Chandler, Guys  I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. 
Rachel, Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. 
Ross, That's worse than no food.
Chandler, HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
Monica, Stinky?!
Chandler, Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Rachel, Oh  I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.
Phoebe, Well  I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Rachel, You know what? I don't want to be with them either  but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together  together. 
Joey,  Just get in there and make a face to face apology  you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Ross, I don't know...
Joey, I'm telling ya...  I can do it.
Ross,   Yeah  he can do it!
Rachel, Oh!
Joey, Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey  the stuffing...
Chandler, The cranberries...?
Monica, Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Joey,  Hey listen guys  we feel really terrible.
Chandler, He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him  don't look at him! 
Joey, Come on you guys  we want you to know we're  very very sorry.   Right guys?
Ross, I feel terrible.
Joey,  Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together  huh?
Chandler, The floating heads do make a good point.
Monica, Yeah  they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Rachel, So bad.
Phoebe, So bad.
Monica,  Okay  okay. You two  go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Rachel, Dessert?
Monica, Yeah  I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember  right?
Phoebe, Pies  oh  we thought you said priiiize . Here! .
Monica, Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Rachel, Congratulatioooons!
Monica, Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well  I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner  then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Ross, Really girls  not cool.
Chandler, Well  you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late  and you still went anyway.
Joey, Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Ross, It's a day to be thankful.
Joey,  Don't make me come up there!
Monica, It's too late for apologies.
Joey, Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Chandler, That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
Rachel, Ewww  is that what that is?
Joey, Sorry!
Phoebe, Come on you guys  let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Rachel, Yeah! I'll cook!
Ross, Yeah! Let's go out.
Rachel, Hey!
Joey, Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Monica, The three of us?
Joey, Yeah! You  Chan  and the vein!
Joey, Ha!
Joey, Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Monica, Joey  that is not gonna work.
Joey, No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Phoebe, I'll pull you through.
Ross, Okay.
Joey,  aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Chandler, A little late for that.
Joey, Alright  hurry up  you gotta do something.
Monica, Alright  well  this does not change anything.  Okay  we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Chandler, Uhm  we've got turkey grease.
Monica, Bring it.
Joey, I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
Monica, Here you go!
Joey, Oh  that smells good!
Joey, Okay.
Monica, Okay  try it.
Joey, It isn't working.
Monica, Alright  we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Joey, Well hurry  I can't feel my ears!
Chandler, Can you ever feel your ears?
Joey, Interesting...
Monica, Chandler  where are your tools?
Chandler,  Oh  I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Monica, I do  but Rachel borrowed them.
Rachel, I lent them to Ross.
Ross, I gave them to Joey.
Joey, I left them at the park.
Monica, Oh!
Ross,  I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Phoebe, I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Ross, Nice!
Monica, Okay  I have to get that. Now when I get back  I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Joey, It's really starting to hurt.
Chandler, Okay  look  I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out  okay? Okay  so PUSH!
Phoebe, Just a sec.  we're kind in the middle of something here.
Joey, Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Chandler, Come on guys  PUSH!
Joey, Yeah! Come on!
Chandler, My cranberries!
Joey,  Man  I've got food all over me.
Chandler, Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
Chandler,  Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Monica,  I don't care.
Chandler, What's going on?
Monica, That was the adoption agency...
Chandler, And?
Monica, WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Chandler, Are you serious? 
Monica, There's a pregnant woman in Ohio  and she picked us!
Rachel, I'm so happy for you!
Monica, This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Rachel, To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
Ross, I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Phoebe, I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Monica, I can't believe they called  and we're actually getting a baby. 
Joey, Oh  I know how you feel...
Rachel, Really?
Joey," Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting  the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys ""R"" Us... She was in stock!"
Chandler, That is the exact same thing.
Chandler, Hi!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hey!
Chandler, We're just here to say goodbye  we're off to Ohio.
Phoebe, Oh  right! Your adoption interview!
Monica, Yep  we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Joey, I can't believe it. When you guys come back  you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Chandler, And so incorrect!
Monica, She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Ross, Come on  she's gonna love you guys!
Chandler, Uhm  thank you  but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
Monica, And a lot could still get in our way.
Chandler, Yeah. I mean  this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
Phoebe, What are you gonna name the baby?
Chandler, I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
Joey, But just think  ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
Monica, Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Chandler, So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
Monica, You know  I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out  we're gonna have a baby Chandler  a baby!
Chandler, Yes  but...
Monica, Oh my God  it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! All right  I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
Chandler, Oh  screw it  I'm gonna be a daddy!!
Rachel,  Hey  who's Phoebe with?
Joey, I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with.   Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, So... who's your friend?
Phoebe, Oh  that's Sarah. No  no. Don't you get any ideas  ok? No  I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Joey, OW  why  why  why?
Phoebe, Because you'll date her once  sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Joey, Oh  name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Phoebe, Mandy.
Joey, Mandy  uh? Uh... really hot blonde  big boobs?
Phoebe, No.
Joey, I know why I don't remember her  huh? 
Rachel, Do you think I'm someone else?
Joey, Ok  I may not have treated your friends well in the past  but I have grown up a lot  really. Honest  Rach?
Rachel, Well  believe it or not  it's true. When Joey and I were together  he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out  he didn't sleep with anybody else!
Joey,  Growth!
Phoebe, Fine  I'll give you her number.
Joey, Ok  thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy.
Phoebe, SARAH!
Joey, Saraaah.
Ross,  Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey you guys  I need some fashion advice.
Rachel, Oh!
Ross,  How does this look?
Rachel, Well  it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away!
Ross, C'mon! This looks good!
Rachel, Ross  please  trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now  I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is  but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
Ross, Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Phoebe, Well  you know  if you want fashion help  Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us  right?
Ross, Really? That would be great. I mean  I have to do something  she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Joey, I can see why  nice shirt!
Ross, You're wearing the same shirt.
Joey, Stupid Gap on every corner!
Monica, Ok  thank you. Uh  well this is it. Are you OK?
Chandler," Yeah. Just weird  you know. It's like: ""Hi  I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"""
Monica, Uh  we're gonna be great.
Chandler, You're gonna be great.
Monica, Well... obviously!
Monica, Hi. It is so  so nice to meet you.
Chandler, Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
Chandler, Ok.
Chandler, That's what our friends call us.
Monica, I don't know about that.
Chandler,  I don't think that's exactly...
Monica,  Let her finish  doctor.
Phoebe, Hey!
Joey, Hey.
Phoebe, Oh  my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Joey, Well...
Phoebe, Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey, Nope.
Phoebe, What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey, Oh  really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner  ok?  We're getting along  having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then  out of nowhere...
Phoebe, That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So  she took some fries  big deal!
Joey, Hey  hey  look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
Phoebe, What?
Joey, ALL FOOD!
Phoebe, I’m sorry  I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Joey, Hey  hey  hey  hey. Look. I take a girl out  she can order whatever she wants! The more  the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Phoebe,  Oh
Rachel, Hi
Phoebe, Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Rachel, what?
Phoebe, Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel, Oh! Oh  no!
Phoebe, What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel, Oh  yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean  just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Phoebe,  You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Rachel, Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey,  JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe, Well  I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to  just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Joey,  I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza  uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?
Phoebe,  This place is awesome!
Ross, You know  we should just go  I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Rachel, Ah  this place is great!
Phoebe, Wow!
Ross, Rach  come on  I’m not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! .
Rachel, Ross  look  I know that some of this stuff is out there  but I mean  come on  look at this  look at this sweater! . I mean  this is just beautiful!
Ross,  Wow  this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Rachel, Yeah  down from seven hundred  you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Ross, Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
Ross, Wow!
Phoebe, Yeah!
Ross, Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Phoebe, What? They will be!
Ross, All right  that’s it  I’m getting out of here.
Rachel, No  no  no  no! Ross  wait! Come on! You know  there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt  look at these nice pants...
Ross, Uh  actually these might look pretty good on me.
Rachel, Yes  they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk  all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
Ross, Really?
Rachel, Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please  just wear what I suggest  and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
Ross, So  you’re saying  uh  if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Rachel,  Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Chandler, So  the fact that I am a doctor  and my wife’s a reverend  that’s important to you?
Monica, Amen.
Chandler, Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica, Uh  good hands.  Healing hands.
Monica, It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Chandler, Yeah  wow.
Monica, Oh  you know  my flock is good  I mean  yeah  my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock  flock  flock.
Chandler, No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Chandler, Yeah  actually. So  you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Chandler, You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Monica, We don’t?
Monica, Oh my God  this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Chandler, Yeah  I did.
Monica,  Hey  thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
Rachel, We got some really great stuff!
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Rachel, Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
Phoebe, Oh! okay. Wait  are we in Joey's imagination?
Rachel,  Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by
Phoebe, oh  well  Ross probably has it  you can get it from him later.
Ross,  So? What do you think? 
Joey, I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross,  Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey,  Dude  I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Ross, Oh  I see  somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Joey,  Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross, You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah  now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!
Chandler, We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica, Why not?
Chandler, It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica, God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler, You have gotta stop!
Monica, But she liked us.
Chandler, She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica, Well  if you think about it  I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean  as a chef  I serve God  by feeing the hungry and poor. 
Chandler, Your Veal Chop is $34 95!
Monica, C'mon Chandler  I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean  the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler, But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica,  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler, I know..
Monica, I mean  who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if  what if no one ever picks us?
Chandler, oh  honey..
Monica,  Please.. please  we are so close.
Chandler, Monica  I want a baby too  but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.
Monica,  okay  right. 
Chandler, So  we'll tell the truth and who knows  maybe she'll like us for us.
Monica,  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler, You're Jewish.
Monica, Technicality!
Joey, Oh  that looks great! Good ordering!
Joey, oh  I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. 
Joey, Uuuh.. yes  they are my stuffed clams.
Joey, How about those fries though  huh? 
Joey,  You are beautiful  you know that?
Joey, Oh  okay.. 
Joey,  NOW look what you did!!
Joey, I don't like it when people take food off of my plate  okay?
Joey, WELL  I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Joey, I'm sorry  I'm overreacting. Okay  It's just when it comes to food  I have certain rules  okay  I mean  There are things you do..and you now  things..  that you don't do .
Ross, Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad  we're finally doing this.
Ross, Here  So this was fun! 
Joey, I really am sorry about  you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Joey,  Well  stuffed clams.
Joey, Uh  excuse me sir  there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Joey,  So stupid  ordering cheesecake  trying to
Joey, Oh  all right  I'll just have what she's having instead.
Joey, Oh yeah  sure. No problem.
Joey, Sure I do.  Coule?
Joey,  Really?
Joey, Yeah  of course. I can control myself. 
Joey,  Stop staring at me!
Joey, Why  just a tiny little...
Joey, Oh-oh!
Joey, I'm not even sorry.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica,  I-Is... Is that a picture?
Monica, Look  doctor!
Chandler, The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Chandler, I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Chandler, Well  our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica, Yeah  but the important thing to know about us  is how much we would care for this little baby. 
Monica," Well  we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend."
Monica, But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Monica, Well  you don't have to decide right now  but if you could just look at our file...
Chandler, Erica wait!
Chandler, You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Chandler, Erica  please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Chandler, But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes  I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Chandler, You still want that baby?
Monica, God bless you Chandler Bing!
Ross, Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Joey,  So  why are you still wearing it?
Ross, Because it's soft... Hey  so how was your date?
Joey, Ooh... Not so good.
Ross, Well  looks like it's just the two of us tonight  huh old buddy?
Joey, Yeah  and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Joey,  JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
Monica,  Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Rachel, My God  get a room!
Monica, I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Phoebe, If you had to  what would you give up  food or sex?
Monica,  Sex!
Chandler,  Seriously  answer faster!
Monica," Oh  I'm sorry honey  you know  but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"
Chandler,  It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe, Ross  how about you. What would you give up  sex or food?
Ross, Food.
Phoebe, Ok  how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Ross, Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel, Oh God. What about you  Joe? What would you give up  sex or food?
Joey, Uhm... oh... I don't know  it's too hard.
Rachel, No  you gotta pick one!
Joey, Oh... food. No  sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God  I don't know  I want girls on bread!
Rachel, You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe, Oh  how cute!
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Oh  she looks just like a little doll!
Rachel, Oh  no  no. That is a doll.
Phoebe, Oh  thank God  'cause that thing's really creepy!  Look  there's Chandler. 
Rachel, Oh. Who is the blonde  she's pretty.
Phoebe, OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel, He's not having an affair!
Phoebe, You know  I'm always right about these things.
Rachel, No  you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Phoebe, Well  I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See  there's something going on with them. Look  he's getting into the car with her!
Rachel, Oh  that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe, Oh yeah? Well  let's see.  Ok  duck down. 
Chandler,  Hello.
Phoebe, Oh  hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Chandler, Oh  uhm... I have to work too. Yeah  I'm stuck at the office all day.
Phoebe,"  Oh  well  it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see  you know  either ""Liar  Liar"" or ""Betrayal""  or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
Chandler, Those are all really old!
Phoebe, Ok  then maybe it'll be  uhm...
Rachel,"  ""Dude  Where's My Car?"""
Phoebe,  What?
Rachel, They're in a caaar...
Phoebe,  Okay  we-we'll talk to you later. Okay  bye.
Rachel, Geez!
Phoebe, Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel, Oh  yeah  ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe,  I got them!
Chandler, Hi!
Monica, Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
Chandler, I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica, Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Chandler, Well  at least the perfume is not mine  be thankful for that!
Monica, So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler, It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
Monica, Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Chandler, And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?
Monica, Don’t you love the huge yard?
Chandler, And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica, And Nancy said that it's really under price  because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler, This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica, So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler, I don’t know. What do you think?
Monica, I think we should.
Chandler, I do too.
Monica, This is huge!
Chandler, I know.
Monica, How bad you wanna smoke  right now.
Chandler, I don’t know what you mean  giant talking cigarette! Oh  by the way  Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car  so if she asks you  I was at work all day.
Monica, Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler, We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean  why upset everybody over nothing.
Monica, Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler, I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Ross, I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
Rachel, I’m telling you guys  we followed them out to a house in Westchester  the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Joey, Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well  something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Ross, I know  and with the baby coming?
Phoebe, So  should we tell her?
Ross, I don’t know. Phoebe  if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Phoebe, Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Ross, No one  I’m just saying if... 
Phoebe, TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ross,  I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy  it was hypothetical!
Phoebe, All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right  he wouldn’t cheat.
Ross, Believe me  if I did see with someone  there’s no way I... 
Rachel, Oh  look at her  so happy!
Monica, If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey, Hey  is uhm... is Chandler here?
Monica, No  he’s picking up dinner  why  what’s up?
Phoebe, Well  look  whatever happens  we’re here for you and we love you.
Ross, We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Monica, What?
Rachel, Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe, They went in together. So sorry.
Monica, Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Phoebe, What?
Joey,  Monica  you understand what we are saying  right?
Monica, Yeah  sure... uhm  I'm devastated  obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey? 
Chandler, Hey!
Joey,  You son of a bitch!
Chandler, Is it me  or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Monica,  Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel, Who's Nancy?
Ross, What's going on?
Monica,  Ok  alright  you guys  you'd better sit down  this is pretty big.
Chandler, Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey, I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe, Why do you have a realtor?
Monica, Uhm  she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Joey,  What?
Rachel, Are you serious?
Monica, When we found out that we're gonna get this baby  Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Phoebe, So you're gonna move?
Ross, Oh my God.
Joey, Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel, What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it  Ross is doing it  Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Monica, And that's great for you guys  but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Chandler, ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross,  So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe, Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city  what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Ross, You know what  if you wanna look for a house  that's okay.
Joey, No  no  it's not  don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you! 
Ross,  It's ok  because they have to get it out of their system  okay   but you're going to realize  this is the only place  you wanna be.
Chandler, Actually  we already found a house we love.
Ross, What?
Monica, And about an hour ago  we made an offer.
Chandler, Bet you wish I was having an affair now  huh?
Ross, You put an offer on a house?
Monica,  It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... 
Phoebe, Wha..? Again with the nature  what are you? Beavers?
Chandler, I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey, Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that   I really  really think I can!
Chandler,  You know that's not the reason Joe. 
Monica, We think if you saw it  you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful  isn't it?
Rachel, Yeah it is.
Joey, What the hell are you doin'?
Rachel, Well  it is  all right? When we were out there today  all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman  but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Phoebe, Yeah  but so is this.
Ross, Yeah  I mean  if you moved there  you have to leave here. I mean  how can you leave this place?
Rachel,  C'mon Daddy  listen to me! All of my life  everyone has always told me  'You're a shoe! You're a shoe  you're a shoe  you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said  'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse  y'know? Or a- or a hat! No  I don't want you to buy me a hat  I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor  Daddy!
Ross, You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel, Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Monica, Well  I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Ross, That money is mine  Green!
Rachel, You're fly is open  Geller!
Phoebe, You guys  you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler, Hey  that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Phoebe,  Eww  look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel, Ow  that had to hurt!
Phoebe, Hey  it’s your Thanksgiving too  y'know  instead of watching football  you could help.
Monica, Okay  Rachel  you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel, No Mon  you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.
Monica, Every year.
Joey,  It's stuck!!!
Phoebe,  Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey, I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe, Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey, It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe, Well  of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Monica, Hey  did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
Joey, It's Joey.
Monica, I got it! How about  if we win  they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel, Oooohh that’s interesting.
Chandler, If you win  we give up the birds.
Joey,  Dah!! 
Chandler, But if we win  we get your apartment.
Joey, Oooooh!
Monica, Deal!
Ross, What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Joey, Big fat goalie.
Ross, Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Chandler, Dangerous Liaisons.
Ross, Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Joey, Weekend at Bernie’s.
Ross, Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Joey, Everyday use.
Chandler, Fancy.
Joey, Guest.
Chandler, Fancy guest.
Ross, Two seconds...
Joey, Uhh  11!
Ross, 11  unbelievable  11 is correct. 
Ross,  Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
Rachel, 14?
Ross, No  19.
Chandler, Thanks man.
Ross, Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Monica, Maurice.
Ross, Correct  his profession was?
Rachel, Space cowboy!
Ross, Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Rachel, Ow...Oh Gosh!
Ross, 10 seconds  you need this or you lose the game.
Monica, It’s umm  it has something to do with transponding.
Rachel, Oh-oh-oh  he’s a transponce—transpondster!
Monica, That’s not even a word!
Monica, NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel, Y’know what  you are mean boys  who are just being mean!
Joey, Hey  don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel, That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica, Hey  we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Rachel, Well it stupid  unfair question!
Ross, Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler, Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Ross, Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler  I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler  I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler,  Wow! Listen  we had a good run. You know  what was it? Four? Five months? I mean  that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So  good-bye  take care  bye-bye then! 
Monica,  Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross, What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel,  Hey  what's-what's going on?!
Chandler, Well  I think  I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey,  Dude! He's right there!
Ross,  I thought you were my best friend  this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler, Look  we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay  I'm in love with her.
Monica, I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry  but iit-t's true  I love him too.
Ross,  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. 
Monica," Well  this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it  ""What were you thinking?"""
Rachel, Funny  because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe, Ok  you guys  I don’t mean to make things worse  but umm  I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Phoebe, You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel, Well  Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Monica, Whoa-whoa-whoa  Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know  I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her  but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm  she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Phoebe, What else?
Monica, When I take a shower  she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel, Yeah  I do. I-I do  do that.
Phoebe, That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica, When I fall asleep on the couch after reading  she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel, Well y’know  I don’t want you to be cold.
Monica, And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler  she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! 
Chandler,  Hey.
Monica, She really left.
Chandler, I know. 
Monica, Thank you.
Chandler, No problem roomie. 
Monica, Can I ask you a question?
Chandler, Sure!
Monica, What the hell is that dog doing here?! 
Chandler, Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned  but for me  this has been really great  you know  I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway  I was just thinking  I mean  if you'd gone to Vail  and if you guys'd been with your family  if you didn't have syphilis and stuff  we wouldn't be all together  you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Ross, And hey  here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel, And a crappy New Year.
Chandler, Here  here!
Rachel, You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey, Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
Phoebe, Yeah  you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ross, You know  sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment  I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something  but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over  who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs  the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. 
Rachel, Yeah. So don't move  okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.
Chandler, Hello? It's Nancy  they responded to our offer.
Monica, And?
Chandler,  Okay  thanks...  They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
Monica, We can't afford that.
Chandler, I know.
Monica, Well  there you go.
Joey, I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross, Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel, Yeah  we're gonna let you be alone.
Phoebe,  You're gonna be okay?
Monica, Yeah  we'll be okay.
Ross, Love you guys. 
Joey, You know  I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Chandler, That's okay  we understand.
Joey, And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her  should I?
Monica, I know there'll be other houses  but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Chandler, Yeah... Well  it's a good thing we got it then.
Monica, What?
Chandler, We got the house.
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler, I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica, Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Chandler, We're getting the house.  We're getting the house.
Monica, And a baby...
Chandler, We're growing up.
Monica, We sure are.
Chandler, So who's gonna tell them?
Monica,  Not it!
Chandler, Not it! Damn it!
Monica, Rachel  this is yours.
Rachel, Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler, You'll see.
Monica, All right  everybody open them!
Rachel, Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. 
Phoebe, Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. 
Monica, I know.
Ross, I love this. 
Joey, A meatball Sub? Thanks! 
Ross, Seriously you guys  what's going on? What are these for?
Chandler, Well  I didn't know how to tell you before  but... We got the house.
Monica, Enjoy!
Joey,  What did they say?
Joey, Hey guys!
Monica, Hey  let me tell them!
Joey, Sure.
Monica, Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe, Great!
Ross, Really? Which one?
Monica,  Ohh! Fish  seaweed  a sunken ship.
Ross," Things you find in the ocean   You're gonna be on ""Pyramid""!!"
Monica, Oh  that was our favourite game show ever!
Ross," Except for ""Match game""..."
Monica," Or ""Win  Lose or Draw""."
Chandler, What did I marry into?
Joey, Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
Monica, Oh  I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Phoebe, Yeah  sorry boys  this ride's closing.
Ross, Oh  and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Joey, Seriously?
Ross,  Yeah-uh!
Monica, Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Chandler, You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Monica, Yeah  we used to perform for our family and friends.
Rachel, Oh God  that's right. I blocked that out.
Monica,"  ""I'm a little bit country""..."
Ross,"  ""...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll""!"
Chandler,  I'm leaving you.
Ross, So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God  look  there's Geoffrey Cleric.
Chandler, Who?
Ross, He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Chandler,  Did I go to this school?
Ross, Hey  there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
Chandler,  Sure  nice.
Ross, Dude. You're married to my sister.
Chandler," You're right  by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
Ross, Hey  I hear she's single again  d'you think I should ask her out?
Chandler, Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Ross, Yes please.
Ross, Hey. Hey  check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
Chandler, Awesome  the name really stands out.
Ross," Thanks to a little something called ""Helvetica Bold 24 point""!"
Chandler, Man  we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Chandler, Hey!
Ross, Hey  Missy...
Chandler, You know  our band is playing on Friday.
Ross," Yeah  yeah. You should come check us out. We're called ""Way! No Way!""."
Chandler, Fresh!
Ross, Boss!
Chandler, Mint!
Ross, She's gone.
Chandler, I know it. You know  I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Ross, Dude  I was gonna ask her out.
Chandler, I said it first  bro.
Ross, Well  I thought it first  Holmes.
Chandler,  Look  if you did...
Ross, Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean  we can get laid anytime we want.
Chandler, Totally. I had sex in High school...
Ross, Me too. I'm good at it.
Chandler, All right  I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Ross, You got it.
Chandler, All right  so that's Missy Goldberg  Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald  who neither of us can go out with.
Ross, Those are the pacts!
Chandler, Oh  and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Ross, Oh  oh... maybe not you!
Chandler, Well  I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Ross, Thank you.  All right  here I go. Hey  remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Chandler, Your hands are shaking.
Ross, I know  and I can't stop sweating. 
Joey,  I know it could be intimidating for regular people to be around celebrities but... relax  I'm just like you!  Only better looking and richer.
Joey,  Uhm... ok. It's a store  like a supermarket.  Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah  ok  ok  uhm... I'm writing in my...
Joey, Noo   more like a notebook... Damn it!  Oh  if I'm building an house  the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey...  In high school  I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Joey, Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for.  OOOH!
Phoebe,  Thank you so much for this.
Rachel, Oh  d'you like it?
Phoebe, Oh my God  it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?
Rachel, What?
Phoebe, You know  the strippers  and the guys dancing  and you know  pee-pee's flying about.
Rachel, Pheebs  I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Phoebe, Oh  ok. I see what you're doing  that's fine. This is all there is  just tea  uh  ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!
Rachel, Seriously Pheebs  it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Phoebe, Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean  really? It's just tea?
Rachel, Nooo! Phoebe  of course there is more! I mean  I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Joey, Ahaha  he might as well just give us the points.
Joey, A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
Joey, Paper  snow  a ghost!
Joey, A rock  a dog  the earth.
Joey, Salami  anchovies  jam!
Joey, Paper  snow  a ghost!
Joey, Chickens?
Joey, Oh!
Joey, Ketchup!
Joey, Relish!
Joey, Oh.
Joey, Yeah...
Joey, Oh  so we didn't win  but it's fun to play the game  right?
Joey, Oh  wow! I'm so sorry  ok? I promise  we'll do better next time!
Joey, Hey  you know  some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
Ross, So  Saturday night!
Ross, Great!
Ross, Oh  well  uh  this is gonna sound kinda silly  but  do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
Ross, It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
Ross, That's ok. Uh  anyway  well he and I both really liked you a lot  uhm  but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship  so we kinda made a pact  that neither of us could ask you out!
Ross, Yeah  why?
Ross, You did?
Ross,  AND ON MY TURF?
Monica,  Hey  where is this guy  it's been over an hour!
Rachel, Well  he's coming from Jersey  he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Monica, Who is it?
Rachel,  Uh! The police!
Phoebe,  Oh!
Monica, What's the matter  officer? Has someone been bad? 
Monica, Are you gonna be ok  officer  uhm ...
Monica, ...If-you-say-so.
Phoebe, Oh  God!
Phoebe, Rachel?
Rachel, Yeah?
Phoebe, Are you kidding?
Rachel, All right  look  we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
Phoebe, How old is your phonebook?
Monica, Oh my God  this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
Phoebe, Oh God no  I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Monica, Oh  no! I mean  obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
Phoebe, This is how I look when I'm turned on!
Phoebe, Shocking!
Phoebe, Three hundred dollars  are you kidding?
Rachel, No  that's ok  let's me just get my check book!
Phoebe, No  you're not gonna pay him  he didn't do anything!
Phoebe, I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Phoebe, Oh yeah  okay. I'm uptight. Yeah  that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! 
Phoebe, I'm sorry  did you say all man or old man?
Monica,  Uh  look  officer... uhm Sir...
Joey,  My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! 
Joey, Oh  .. uh... uh... pass.  Pass.  Pass.   Okay  the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Joey, Oh  then pass. 
Ross,  You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that  after you promised me?
Chandler,  Excuse me. . That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Ross, You broke the pact!
Chandler, Ross  that was 16 years ago!
Ross, That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
Chandler, I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right  look  if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Ross, I didn't.
Chandler, Oh really?
Ross, No.
Chandler, Oh really!?
Ross, NO!
Chandler, ADRIENNE TURNER!! 
Ross, I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Chandler, Oh please  and you knew how much I liked her.
Ross, I don't know what... you're talking about.
Chandler, Really?
Monica, I can't believe we are at a real college party!  I have to pee so bad!
Rachel, This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Monica, Hey  you've got a boyfriend!
Rachel, I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight  I'm sooo gonna let them! 
Monica, Look  there's Chandler. You knew  that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Rachel, It... You can so totally tell.
Monica, I KNOW!
Rachel, Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is.  Hey  how's it going .
Chandler, Aren't you...?
Rachel, Yeah  Rachel. And this  is Ross' sister  Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. .
Chandler,  Right.  So how're you doing?
Rachel, Bitchin'
Chandler, Hi Monica.
Monica, Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you  NOT. 
Chandler, O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. 
Monica, Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Rachel, Oh.
Monica, Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross, Listen Adrienne  you can't tell Chandler about this.
Ross, Cool! 
Ross, I didn't know you knew about that.
Chandler," Well  I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song: ""Betrayal In The Common Room""."
Ross,  Man... I... I'm sorry.
Chandler, Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ross, So  eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
Chandler,  Hmm mmmhm..
Ross, We are even  right?
Chandler,  Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought  who does Ross like the more than anybody?
Ross,  What did you do to my mom?
Chandler, Not her!
Rachel, I am sooo drunk.
Monica, That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. 
Chandler, Soo... you girls having fun?
Monica, For your information  ass munch  I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. 
Monica, Oh THATS ME! 
Rachel,  I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Chandler, Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Rachel,  Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
Chandler, Well  maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Rachel,  Oh  what a line. 
Chandler, So where are you applying to?
Rachel, Oh well  You know  I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun  so I'm sort of...   Hey!
Chandler, I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Rachel,  Yeah okay. 
Phoebe, You know  it's fine. We'll pay you.
Rachel, No  wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean  what skills do you have?
Rachel, So maybe something in an office.
Phoebe, Or you could teach stripping. You know  share your gift  pass the torch.
Phoebe, There you go. Okay  do you think you're gonna be okay?
Phoebe,  Finish it!
Phoebe, Your last dance. Do it for us.
Rachel,  Really?
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Phoebe, Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
Phoebe, Oh no  no  no  don't stop!
Joey,  Yeah...
Joey, I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
Joey,  Oh  I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Joey," Things that go ""tssst"" when you put them out."
Joey, Things that burn.
Joey, Dude  dude! I think you're losing it.
Joey, Oh  oh  oh... What a dog says.
Joey,  Pizza toppings  next!
Joey, Oh  oh  oh... 
Joey, Girls Chandler could never get?
Joey, Where? 
Ross, Hey  where's Rachel?
Monica, She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Ross, Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
Monica, What? When was this?
Ross, Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Monica, Oh my God! That's wild!
Chandler, Yeah  but it was like a million years ago  so it doesn't matter.
Ross, Well  it matters to me.
Chandler, Why?
Ross, Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
Chandler, You kissed her that night too?
Monica, Two guys in one night? Wow  I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
Chandler, Seriously  where did this happen?
Ross, Okay  after you told me she was passed out in our room  I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed  all buried in peoples coats. Well  I went to kiss her on the forehead  you know. But it was so dark  I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away  but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second  but... it was amazing. And now  now I find out that you kissed her first.
Chandler, Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Ross, Mine.
Chandler, I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Ross, No  she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler, Why would I kiss a girl  and then put her on your bed?
Ross, Well  then who was on my bed?
Monica,  OH! Oh  oh! 
Ross,  NO! No  no!
Monica, YES! 
Ross, You were under the pile of coats?
Monica, I was the pile of coats!
Ross, OH MY GOD!
Monica, You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross, You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica, You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler, What did I marry into?
Monica, Oh  crap!
Phoebe, Oh  hey Joey.
Joey, Uh  hey.
Phoebe, Listen  I need to ask you something. Ok  you know how my step dad's in prison.
Joey,  Yeah.
Phoebe, Yeah. Well  uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough  so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow  but he just called and... uhm... well  apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey, So he can't come?
Phoebe, No  and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well  I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey, Seriously?
Phoebe, Yeah  you've... you know  sort of been like a dad to me. I mean  you've always  you know  looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Joey, I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe, So... what do you say?
Joey, Are you kidding? Phoebe  I would be honored. 
Phoebe, Oh  thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey,  Listen  I hope... that you know...  I don't want you to see your father cry  GO TO YOUR ROOM!
Phoebe, Oh.
Joey, Oh no  no  no  let your dad get this.
Phoebe,  Oh  it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!  Hello... Hey  ok  stop screaming! Ok? So  halibut. All right  so salmon  either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Monica,  Well  it matters to me!
Phoebe, Well  I don't care  so you pick!
Monica, Did you just hung up on me?  All right  look  I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Phoebe, Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica, You don't know military time?
Phoebe, Why  I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Monica, Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe, Ok  so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand  seven hundred and...
Monica,  Six o'clock!
Phoebe, Ok.
Monica, Ok. Hold on.  Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye.  Oh  how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Phoebe, Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica, Please... honey  leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now  ok  I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe, What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica, Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe, She did? Why?
Monica," I made her.  Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent."
Phoebe,  Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.
Chandler, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey!
Chandler, You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner  you know  I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Phoebe, Okay  what did we say was your one gift to us?
Chandler, No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Phoebe, Rehearse it!
Ross, Hi! 
Ross, Oh   hey  oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Ross, That is why!
Phoebe, So Rach.
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe, Where is Emma?
Rachel, Oh  Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Monica,  Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs  you gotta keep the line moving  remember  20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time! 
Joey, Hey  you're Mike's parents  right?
Joey, Ah  our little ones are growing up fast  uh?
Joey, You know  on the one hand you're happy for them  but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Joey, Hey  I'm not that fond of you either  ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
Chandler,  You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Ross, Yeah  I thought we'd be groomsmen  but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Rachel, Uh... November?
Ross, I wanna say it's not looking good.
Rachel, Hey Pheebs...
Phoebe, What's up?
Rachel, Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Chandler, Heh.
Phoebe, Uhm... well  they're not in the wedding.
Ross, What? 
Rachel, Well  this is really awkward  Oh  and I can leave!
Phoebe, I'm sorry you guys but  you know  Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know  you were-you were... if it helps you  you were next in line  you just-you just missed the cut.
Ross, Oh  man!
Chandler, This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me!
Ross, FOOTBALL!
Chandler, Thank you.
Monica,  Pheebs  spit that out  that has pork in it.
Phoebe, Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Monica, Yeah  I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Phoebe, I don't have a fax machine.
Monica, Ah  well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
Ross, I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Chandler, I know  I hate being left out of things.
Ross, And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Chandler, Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Chandler, What happened?
Ross, Who cares  AND?
Ross, I'll do it!
Chandler,  M-Me-me-me!
Chandler, Pick me  I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
Ross, No  Mike  no  no. You wanna pick me  I mean... watch!  Huh?
Ross,  Well  if Phoebe's choosing  then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Chandler, Oh  I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Ross, Please  you're going down!
Chandler, You are going downer!
Ross, Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Chandler,  I wouldn't know  I didn't make it! 
Joey, So  you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad  tomorrow  right?
Joey, Oh  hey  my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
Joey, Oh  a wiseacre. . No  no  no  I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?
Joey, Strike two!
Joey, Strike three! You only get one more  Mike!
Ross, So  what did you decide?
Phoebe, I decided to pee.
Chandler, Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Phoebe, Oh no  no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
Chandler, Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Phoebe, Oh  I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay  wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Rachel,  Goody  what is it!
Phoebe, Well  there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
Rachel, What  what  what  no  I don't wanna do that.
Phoebe, All right  I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Ross, I'll do it! 
Monica, Ok  it's 2100 hours.  Time for your toast. 
Monica, You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time  Mike! . Now  in regard to the toast  okay  you wanna keep them short  nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in  do your thing and get out!
Monica,  It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok  the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say. 
Phoebe, Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know  but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I  I...  oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because...  it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway  so  ok  Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike  only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought  uhm  my Mike and  and  but despite  you know... it got... it got good. Ok  I wanna take a moment to mention my mother  who couldn't be here...
Phoebe, And... moment's over!  So  ok  uh  I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm...  Oh this is funny! Oh  but you need to know that to... that  to... Oh  ok  well  uhm  I . Ok  ok  I  ok  I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY  I DON'T WANT THIS  OR THIS  OR THIS  OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS!  You know what? You're done.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, YOU'RE FIRED!   Cheers! 
Phoebe, Hey!
Rachel, Happy wedding day!
Phoebe, Oh  happy my wedding day to you!
Rachel, Ok-dokey  Joey  listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central  all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh  I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Joey, Oh  man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
Monica, Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is  uh  well  I'm willing to take my job back.
Phoebe, Oh  well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.
Monica, Oh  is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want  then here... I give you the headset. Well  I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over  you should probably return these messages. 
Phoebe, Wow  this is a lot!
Monica, Uh-huh  but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean  I have won awards for my organizational skills  but  uh  I'm sure you'll do fine.
Phoebe, You won awards?
Monica, Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Ross, Hey!
Monica, Hi.
Ross, Where's Rach?
Monica, She's in her room  why?
Ross, I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation  ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! .  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Rachel, What d'you want?
Ross, You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet  have you?
Rachel, Oh  Ross  c'mon  please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Ross, I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Rachel, Well  Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Ross, Listen  listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now  I promise I won't say a word  but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Rachel, Oh  you are the lesser of two evils!
Ross,  YES  YES!
Phoebe, Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?
Monica, I know.
Phoebe," Listen  Mike  if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?"
Phoebe, Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!
Joey,  Hello Michael.
Joey, May I have a word with you  please?
Joey, Have a seat.  Last night  I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead  you disrespect me...  I cannot allow this.
Joey," More back talk. And yes  I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."""
Joey, I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me  ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Joey,  That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family  ok  and now you're gonna be family  and there is nothing more important in the whole world  than family.
Joey,  That was ME!
Rachel, Hi
Chandler, Hey  can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross  he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me  you'll be getting some comedy!
Rachel, Even so  I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Chandler, Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See  when I was a kid  I was always left out of everything  you know  and it really made me feel... insecure. You know  I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean  this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway  If I'm the only one left out of this wedding  I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
Rachel, All right fine  I pick you.
Chandler,"  Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
Rachel,  Oh my...
Phoebe, No! We're gonna do it my way.  Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go  I have another call  Reverend.  Hello?
Joey, I'm glad we had this little talk.
Phoebe, Okay.
Monica, Bye.
Phoebe, Oh my God  what's it doing here?
Monica,  Ugh  I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.  Uh! What a pickle.
Phoebe,  Oh my God  everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?
Joey,  How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? 
Chandler, How's it going?
Ross,  Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Chandler,  That's what I was doing too.
Ross,  Well  you have fun tonight.
Chandler, You too.
Ross, Oh  I will.
Chandler, Me too.
Ross, Wait a minute  I know why I'm being such an ass  why are you?
Chandler, I'm not supposed to tell you.
Ross, I'm not supposed to tell you!
Chandler, You told us both we could be in the wedding? 
Rachel, Well  in my defense  you were not supposed to tell each other.
Ross, Rachel  only one of us can do it  you have to choose. You and me together again. 
Chandler, Rach  Rach  knock knock.
Rachel, Who's there?
Chandler, I'll tell you at the wedding.
Rachel, Uh.
Rachel, You know what  I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Ross, What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Rachel,  Wow  this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
Phoebe, Alright  wait  so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club  but the food is not and the drinks are there  but the bartender is not? Are you  are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
Monica,  How's it going?
Phoebe,  Help me.
Monica, What?
Phoebe, I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Monica,  Really?
Phoebe,  Please?
Monica, You really want me to come back?
Phoebe, More than I wanna get married.
Monica, Ok people  we are back in business!  Oh God  we've missed you soo much!  Ok  go and get your hair and make-up done  and I'll take care of everything.
Joey, Hey  what are you guys gonna do?
Phoebe,  About what?
Joey, The blizzard. I just saw on the news  it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels. 
Monica, Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Joey, I don't think they are.
Ross,  Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either.  So sorry Pheebs.
Monica,  Well  the club lost it's power.
Joey, Yeah according to the news  most of the city did.
Rachel, Since when do you watch the news?
Joey, Uh  for your information  since they hired a very hot weather girl.
Ross,  I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Phoebe, I know.
Rachel, Wow  you know  it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
Phoebe, What?
Rachel, Well  look  it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Phoebe,  What do you think?
Phoebe, Me too!  Monica  do you think we could do it?
Monica,  AFFIRMATIVE!
Monica,  OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther  hit the Christmas lights.  Okay  who left the ice sculpture  ON THE STEAM GRATE? 
Chandler, So technically  would this person be in the wedding?
Ross, No  but Chandler  hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
Chandler, I'm not scared.  I'll just take little Chappy and...  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Ross,  Well  I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa...  He stinks!
Monica, Level 1 alert. I repeat  level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.
Joey, Oh hey  don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Monica, Really?
Joey, Yeah  you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
Ross, Uhm  ministers don't ride the subway for free.
Joey, I had to read the Bible pretty carefully  but... yeah we do.
Monica, Okay  if Joey does the ceremony  then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.
Chandler,  I'll do it.
Ross, I'll...
Chandler,  Na ha ha...  Ne he he...  Ah ah...
Monica, Okay  Mike and Joey  get in position. Chandler  come with me. 
Monica, Okay  Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.
Phoebe, Oh  okay. Hi new dad. 
Monica, So  you're ready to do this?
Phoebe, Uhuh  uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Rachel, Oh Phoebe  I'm so happy for you honey. 
Phoebe, Oh  thank you.
Monica, I love you.  Oh  wait  wait  wait! No hugs. The dresses... Oh what the hell. 
Phoebe, I love you guys.
Monica, Okay.  It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count.  Let's get this bad boy on the road.
Chandler,  Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Monica,  I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Chandler, Oh yeah! 
Monica, Okay Marjorie  hit it.
Rachel, Geez Ross  you could have showered.
Ross, It's the dog.
Monica, Groomsman  groomsman  why are you just standing there  where is your bridesmaid?  We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down!  Oh  that's me.
Chandler, Ready?
Phoebe,  Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Phoebe, Oh wait  oh no. Wait.
Chandler, Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
Phoebe, I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Chandler, You look beautiful.
Phoebe, Thank you.
Phoebe, Na-ah.
Joey, Friends  family  dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Joey,  Okay...
Phoebe, When I was growing up  I didn't have a normal mom and dad  or a regular family like everybody else  and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today  knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family. 
Phoebe, Oh wait  oh I forgot... and uhm... I love you... and you have nice eyes.
Ross, Uh Joey...
Joey, Yeah?
Ross, Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Joey, Oh  okay. Phoebe  do you take this man to be your husband?
Phoebe, I do.
Joey, Mike  do you take this woman to be your wife?
Joey, I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
Phoebe, I got married!  Could someone get me a coat  I'm freaking freezing.
Chandler, That really was an incredible wedding.
Joey, It was  yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey  you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Chandler, I'd love to  but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Joey, Nice. Oh hey  what about Ross?
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Ross, Come on Chappy  do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Phoebe, Hi
Rachel, How was the honeymoon?
Rachel, Oh!
Chandler, So  where's Mike?
Phoebe, Oh  he's at the doctor  he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
Joey, Well anyway  I'm glad you're back  I really need your help.
Phoebe, Oh  why? What's up?
Joey, I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which  according to my résumé  I'm fluent in.
Ross, Joey  you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
Monica, Yeah  you really shouldn't.  By the way  how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ross,  It was ok...
Rachel, I did not know you spoke French.
Phoebe, Oui  bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
Rachel, Oh... you're so sexy!
Joey, Well  so  will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Phoebe, Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi  mon ami.
Rachel, Seriously stop it  or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Chandler, Why are you wearing my apron?
Monica, I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh  by the way  we have to leave for the airport soon  her plane comes in about an hour.
Chandler," Oh  hey  when she gets here  is it ok if I introduce you two as ""my wife"" and ""the woman who's carrying my child""?  No? Divorce?"
Ross,  Hey.
Monica, Hey.
Ross, You guys know where Rachel is?
Monica, No  we haven't seen her since this morning.
Ross, So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma. 
Monica, Hey!
Ross, Hey!
Monica, These are for Erica!
Ross, What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Monica, Well  I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
Ross, So  why is Erica coming to visit?
Monica, Well  because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know  Statue of Liberty  Empire State Building...
Chandler," Oh  those places! There's always so many people  their being corralled like cattle  and... you know  there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"
Monica, Well  if it annoys you so much  then why do you do it?
Ross,  Oh  hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Rachel, Ross...
Ross, No  no  no  I'm sure you have a great excuse  wh-was it a hair appointment  a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
Rachel, My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney’s.
Ross, Oh my God.
Monica, Honey.
Chandler, I'm so sorry...
Ross, Is-is he ok?
Rachel, Yeah  they said he's gonna be fine  but he's still heavily sedated.
Ross, Ok  ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you  I mean  you can't be alone right now.
Rachel, No  come on  I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Ross, Still-still  let me come... for me.
Rachel, Ok. If you really need to.
Ross, I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Rachel, Oh  I really could.
Ross, Oh!
Rachel, Ohh... 
Phoebe," All right  it seems pretty simple. Your first line is ""My name is Claude""  so  just repeat after me. ""Je m'appelle Claude""."
Joey, Je de coup Clow.
Phoebe, Well  just... let's try it again.
Joey, Ok.
Phoebe, Je m'appelle Claude.
Joey, Je depli mblue.
Phoebe, Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.
Joey, Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Phoebe, It does  really?

Joey, Hi.
Monica, Everyone. Erica  baby!
Chandler, Monica. Calm  self.
Joey," Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ""ghe deu flooff New York City""?"
Chandler, Why would you say that?
Phoebe, Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
Joey, Oh  you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Chandler, Great!  This baby'd better to be really good.
Rachel,  Oh  uhm  excuse me  I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
Ross, And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Rachel, Ross  please  this is a hospital  ok? That actually means something here.
Rachel, Can somebody please go in?
Ross, Rach  I think I'm gonna wait out here  because my throat is feeling a little scratchy  I don't want to infect him.
Rachel, Ross  please  don't be so scared of him!
Ross, I'm not scared of him  I'm really sick!
Ross, I'm feeling better.
Rachel, Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh  ohhh  wow  that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain  huh?
Rachel, Oh  great  Are you gonna be ok?
Ross, He's unconscious  I think we'll be just fine!
Ross, Did the TV wake you?
Ross, Ouchy.
Ross, Well  I came with Rachel  who should be back any second!  So what's new?
Ross, Right  is it painful?
Ross, Nope  just the one. RACH!
Phoebe, Je m'appelle Claude.

Ross, Hey!
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
Rachel, Uh.  Did you call your parents?
Ross, Oh  yeah. Emma's doing great.
Rachel, Oh good.
Ross, Wow.
Rachel, What?
Ross, Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel, What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Ross, Yeah  sure  right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
Rachel, Ok I gotta tell ya  it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Ross, Sorry. . You ok?
Rachel, Yeah.
Ross, You had a rough day  uh?
Rachel, Yeah  just so weird seeing him like that  you know? I mean he is a doctor  you don't expect doctors to get sick!
Ross, But we do!  It's gonna be ok  Rach!
Rachel,  Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Ross, What? No  no! Hey  hey  hey look...
Rachel, What?
Ross, They gave him a lot of medication  ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look  we'll go see him first thing in the morning  ok?
Rachel, Really  I shouldn't feel guilty?
Ross, No  God! Hey  Rach  you've been an amazing daughter  ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
Rachel, Ok  maybe you're right.
Ross,  Good night.
Rachel, Wait  wait  wait  wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Ross, Sure!
Rachel, Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.
Ross, Oh  of course...
Rachel, Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Ross, Me too. Come here. 
Rachel, I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Ross, Ok  well  uh  I can maybe grab a sleeping bag  or... Oh  oh. . No  Rach! I'm sorry  I just don't think this  this  this is a good idea.
Rachel, Wait  we won't know that until we do it  will we?
Ross, No  look  uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right  I'd feel like I'd be  you know  taking advantage of you.
Rachel, Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage  enjoy!
Ross, Look  I'm sure it would be great  but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly  so  I'm gonna go!
Rachel, Wow. Ok.
Ross, I'll see you in the morning .
Rachel, Mhm-mh!
Ross,  Haven't had sex in four months  I should get a medal for that!
Monica, Oh  I'm glad. Listen  I want to apologize about Chandler  though. I just did not see this coming.
Chandler,  New York is awesome!
Monica, What is with you?
Chandler, Yeah  I've been to these places before  but I've never really seen them  you know.
Monica, Yeah  you miss alot  when you're moo-ing.
Monica, Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Chandler, Oh  uhm  okay  uhm  do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Chandler, That's great.
Monica, How's that now?
Chandler, So  what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Monica, Was he falsely accused of something? 
Chandler, I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Monica, Are you awake?
Chandler, Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! 
Monica, Alright  we don't know that it's him. I mean  it could be the football guy.
Chandler, Honey  it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Monica, Alright  lets say that it is him  would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Chandler, I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
Monica, How?
Chandler, I dunno  aren't there tests for these things  right?
Monica, Yeah  but maybe we're just over-reacting.
Chandler," Pff  easy for you to say  he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
Joey, Huh  un  blu  bla  flu  flenk!
Joey, Thank you.
Phoebe, Hey Joey.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Listen  I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and  and I know  I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Joey, Oh  no  that's okay  I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say  I am pretty good!
Phoebe, Really  can I hear some of it.
Joey," Sure  sure. Ok   ""Bleu de la bleu  de la blu bla bleu""  See?"
Phoebe, Well  you're not   You're not... you're not... again  you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
Joey,  Oh well I think I am  yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Phoebe, How could you possibly think that?
Joey, For one thing  the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
Ross, Hey Rach  can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Rachel,  Sure. 
Ross, You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
Rachel, Hmm-hmm. 
Ross, You sure you're alright?
Rachel,  Yep.
Ross,  O-kay. Well  I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. 
Rachel, FYI..
Ross,  There it is... 
Rachel, In the future  when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. 
Ross,  Wait  wait   You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
Rachel,  Really? Well  it seems to me if you'd done the right thing  I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed  I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Ross,  Well...
Rachel, Oh stop that!
Ross, I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
Rachel,  Oh  that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
Ross, Hey  I was looking out for you.
Rachel, Oh  really  well Ross  you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Ross, I gotta say  I have not had sex a lot of times before  this is the worst ever.
Rachel, Oh  really  really? Well  it wasn't very good for me either. 
Ross, Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future  let's just say  you and me  never having sex again.
Rachel, What?
Ross, That's right  sex is off the table.  I am never having sex with you again.  Dr. Green  are you feeling better? 
Chandler, Hey! How was lunch?
Chandler,  Oh  really?
Chandler, O-okay.  So  is she gonna take the test?
Monica, Nope  she doesn't have to  I found out who the father is.
Chandler, Oh God. It's shovely-Joe  isn't it?
Monica,  No it's not.
Chandler, How do you know?
Chandler, Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
Monica, The thing we never do.
Chandler,  Shovely Joe!
Joey, Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh  c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Joey, Dude  come on! French it u-up!
Joey, Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Phoebe,  Uh  excuse me. Uh  I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
Joey, Sa-sa-saw!
Phoebe, Écoutez  je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. 
Phoebe, Alors  si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... 
Joey, Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Joey,  Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Phoebe,  Merci. Au revoir. 
Joey, Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
Ross, Emma's down for the night.
Rachel, Oh  good.
Ross, So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
Rachel," Okay... Hey listen  just before you go I-I again  I just wanna say ""thank you"" for coming with me."
Ross, Oh  no problem.
Rachel, And also  you know I uh  I was thinking about what you said  you know  about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ross, Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
Rachel, It's a shame though  I mean  when we did it  it was pretty good.
Ross, Yeah... Yeah  that's true.
Rachel, Hey uhm  do you remember that one really great time...?
Ross, Oh  ye-ah!
Rachel, You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
Ross, ...Valentine's day...
Rachel, Well  I guess that's all in the past  now.
Ross, Hmmm-mmmm.
Rachel,  Not even one more time?
Ross, Not even once.
Rachel, No matter how much we want it.
Ross, Even if we want it really bad.
Rachel, That's what we decided.
Ross, Uhm  right!
Rachel, ...It's kinda hard though!
Ross, Yeah.
Rachel, You know  when two people have a connection  you know  that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Ross, ...I hate waste.
Rachel, ...Ross?
Ross, Yes?
Rachel, Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table. 
Ross, Damn it. It's never off the table. 
Phoebe, Okay  can you really tapdance?
Joey, No.
Phoebe, It's off the resumé. 
Phoebe, Archery?
Joey, No.
Phoebe, Horseback riding?
Joey, Would fall off a lot.
Phoebe, You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey, That I can do.
Phoebe, Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
Joey, All right  watch me!  Okay  you time me. Ready?
Phoebe, Ready... GO!
Phoebe,  You did it!
Phoebe, Oh! Yeah  this is fun  couples night.
Chandler, Yeah  I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Monica, Well  because every time we do  you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Chandler, You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah  like you wouldn't have done it. 
Ross,  Hey  you guys... I have great news.
Monica, Ross  we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Ross, Oh  well  er  I already ate  but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...
Chandler, A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Ross, Try sixty-five million years ago  and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Phoebe, Wow!
Ross, Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles  uh? I am gonna get laid.
Rachel,  Hi you guys.
Rachel, Ooh  Italian! 
Monica, No one wanted seconds  right?
Ross, No  no. I-I'm good.
Rachel, Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
Ross, I'm up for tenure.
Rachel, Congratulations!
Ross, You too! What are the odds?
Rachel, Ooh! 
Joey,  Guess what?  I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Monica, I don't know who I'm happiest for...
Phoebe, I do  he's been working on that all day! 
Phoebe, Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
Monica, No  no. It felt nice to acknowledge this. 
Phoebe, Where did you go to do it?
Monica, Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Chandler, YOU NEVER DID IT!
Monica, I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Chandler, Hey! I will have you know that... aah  who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Phoebe, Thanks! Honey  would you want me to take your name?
Phoebe, All right  let's see  call me mrs Hannigan.
Chandler, Mrs Hannigan?
Phoebe, What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh  I like it.
Joey,  Hey guys.
Chandler, Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
Joey, No  thank you.
Monica, All right. I know you're not happy about us moving  but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Chandler, Yeah  come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Joey, But no  it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Monica, Joey  please come. It would mean so much to us.
Joey, You know what? You are my friends  I wanna be supportive  I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
Chandler, Damn it.
Monica, See you guys later.
Phoebe, Okay!
Monica,  I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
Phoebe, Good for you. That was really mature.
Joey, What? No  the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house  is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it  so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Phoebe, Joey  you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me  there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
Phoebe, All right  prude... Look  Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Joey," Hey  hey... I can convince people to do anything  you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that ""thing"". What is it?"
Joey, I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! 
Rachel,  Hi  I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki  which could be confusing.
Rachel, Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
Rachel, But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
Rachel, Sssshhhh!
Rachel, Hi... I'm on a date...
Rachel, Yeah  it is. Yeah  you know  it's tough. Single mom  career... You gotta get out there.
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, Yes  hi!
Rachel, Hi!  Excuse us.
Rachel, Okay. Oh  yeah...  Oh he's cute!
Rachel, Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
Rachel,  Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
Rachel, What? I-I don't.
Rachel, No  I-I-I love it there.
Phoebe,  This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself.  But you obviously haven't.
Phoebe, I need to change my name  please. See  I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law.  You're fun.
Phoebe, Okay  well  I just don't  I don't know how it works exactly. See  my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan  so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Phoebe, Well  not anything  I mean...
Phoebe, Oh  this could take a while.
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe, Oh  not anymore. I changed it today.
Monica, Oh  I'm sorry  mrs Hannigan.
Phoebe, Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought  all right  here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Chandler, That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica, Phoebe!
Phoebe, Uh! Princess Consuela.
Monica, You seriously changed your name to that?
Phoebe, Uh-huh!
Monica, Okay  so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Phoebe, Uhm  no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Chandler, Hey  how'd the interview go?
Rachel, Oh! It's not good.
Chandler, You know  I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Rachel, Well  I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Chandler, That is a bad interview.
Phoebe, What are you  what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel," Well  my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go  because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true."
Monica, Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Ross, Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a  it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Phoebe, Ross...
Ross, I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Ross, This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther  six glasses!
Ross, Oh  I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well  I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Chandler, Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross, I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach  so uh... how did your thing go?
Rachel, Oh it... good! Yeah  but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Ross, Oh  you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Phoebe, Can you?
Rachel, Ah  all right. Here's to Ross!
Ross, And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
Phoebe, And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything. 
Ross, But also knowing it means a lot.
Monica, But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Ross, ...that center around work.
Chandler, To Ross!
Ross, You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Phoebe, Oh God!
Ross, No seriously. I have job security for life. You know  I never have to worry.  Oh  look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Rachel,  No  it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Ross, Rach  I'm so sorry.
Rachel, Oh!
Ross, Great. I feel like an idiot.
Rachel, No  it's okay  you didn't know.
Ross, Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
Monica, Thank you for letting us see the house again.
Chandler, And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said  but thank you.
Monica, Ah  so glad you decided to come.
Joey, Me too. Yeah  this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although  you know  I hope you like fungus.
Chandler, What?
Joey, Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Monica, No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
Joey, Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Monica, Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
Joey, Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh  it's pretty dark. 
Monica, No it's not!
Joey,  Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Chandler, When your head was hanging out the window  it didn't hit a mailbox  did it?
Joey,  Maybe. Well  I just think you guys can do better than this house  you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Monica, Oh Joey  look  we know you're having a hard time with this  but we really  we love it here.
Joey, FINE  ok  if you love this house so much  then you should just live here  okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Monica, Joey  we know that's you.
Joey, no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
Phoebe, Welcome back!
Phoebe, Oh  me too!
Phoebe, Well  I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe, Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock! 
Phoebe, Nope.
Phoebe, Yep.
Phoebe, Why? It's fun  it's different  no-one else has a name like it.
Phoebe, Great  okay  what are you gonna change it to?
Phoebe, Mike Crap Bag?
Phoebe, You're not serious  right?
Phoebe, Uhu  uhu  well  then  great. If you love it  I love it.
Phoebe, And I love Crap.
Joey,  Ow!
Joey, Oh  hi  I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?
Joey,  Oh.
Joey, I hate my friends.  Alright  look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
Joey,  Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me  and you tell them that the house is haunted!
Joey, Woah  uh! Okay  let's hear your great idea.
Joey,  Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean  you know  if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach  you know what I mean?
Joey, What am I gonna do  I feel like I'm losing my friends.
Joey, Oh  yeah  sure  easy for you  you're young. Me  I'm set in my ways.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  I guess.
Joey,  Yeah  maybe.
Joey,  I hate to admit it  but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
Joey,  Just when I thought we could be friends. 
Rachel, Oh  thank you... 
Rachel,  Well  now I don't have to. 
Rachel,  Ross  what is taking you so long?
Ross,   I'm sorry  it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Rachel,  Mark? Oh my God! 
Rachel, I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
Ross, Uh  you know  you can't always get a seat on the subway  so... 
Rachel, Oh  well   you're not catching me on my best day.
Rachel, No  but it's good  you know  I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Rachel, Well  screw charity work. What've you got?
Rachel, Great! I'll call ya!
Ross, Yeah! yeah  I got tenure! 
Rachel,  Oh my God!
Ross, See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
Rachel, Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Ross,  That is Mark?
Rachel, Yes.
Ross, I hate that guy.
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, No  no  NO  you cannot go to dinner with him.
Rachel, What? You don't want me to get a job?
Ross, Oh yeah  I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Rachel, Ugh.
Ross, I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy  okay?
Rachel, Ross  you know what?  Okay  let's talk about it later  there comes security. 
Monica, Oh  I love this street. The trees  the big front yards  the actual picket fences.
Chandler, Man  those two dogs are going at it!
Joey,  Hey!
Chandler, Hey.
Monica, Hey  where have you been?
Joey, Oh  just er... you know  looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Chandler, Really? What changed your mind?
Joey, Oh well  the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
Chandler, Joey  there was a little girl who lived here  but she died like 30 years ago.
Joey,  What?
Chandler, Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Joey, That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Monica, Joey  now that you're okay with the house  do you wanna go see your room?
Joey, What? I get my own room?
Chandler, You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Joey, Oh my God!  Oh! Hey  can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Joey, Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Phoebe, Thank you  mister Bag.
Phoebe, Oh hi Rita! Good!  Oh  Rita's a massage client.
Phoebe,  Er  Rita  this is my husband.
Phoebe, Yeah.
Phoebe,  Okay  I will.  This is my husband Crap Bag.
Phoebe, Yeah... Ogh... Okay  fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Phoebe, How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Phoebe, Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Phoebe, It's a funny word.
Phoebe, ...Oh crap!
Ross, Hey  is Rachel here?
Monica, No.
Ross, She's still at dinner?
Monica, I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Ross, That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
Chandler, It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!
Ross, We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
Monica, So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean  she's single and he's cute.
Chandler, Excuse me?
Monica, Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
Chandler, For your information  I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Monica, Oh  sorry!
Rachel,  Hi you guys!
Ross, Hey  so uhm... How was dinner?
Rachel, Oh  it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Ross,  Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Rachel, Oh Ross  come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
Ross, Should we send something?
Chandler, How did the job stuff go?
Rachel, He offered me one.
Chandler, That's great!
Ross, Congratulations!
Rachel, I know  it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Ross, Can we  can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along  huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel, The job is in Paris. 
Joey, I mean  this soap opera is a great gig  but... am I missing opportunities? You know  I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean  should I be trying to do more independent movies?
Joey, Hey bear  I need some career advice.
Chandler, How did the job stuff go?
Rachel, He offered me one.
Ross,  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
Rachel, The job is in Paris. 
Rachel, Oh  God! Please  somebody say something.
Ross, So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Chandler, Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Rachel, I know  it's huge  and it's scary  and it's... really far  far away from you guys  but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma  and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
Ross, Okay.
Rachel, I mean  I'll fly back and forth  they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Chandler, My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. 
Ross, All right  we'll work it out.
Rachel, Thank you! Thank you!
Ross, Yeah  yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
Rachel, I think it is. 
Phoebe, Ooh  what's going on?
Rachel, I got a really incredible job offer.
Joey, Hey  great! All right!
Phoebe, Good for you!
Rachel, It's in Paris.
Joey, What? No  no  no! No  no... no... no  no... No  too much is changing  okay? First  Phoebe getting married  Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Monica, Hey  this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
Joey, Well  it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Rachel, Look  you guys... this is really  really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
Phoebe, Of course we can. Congratulations.  Yay!  Joey...
Joey, No  no  no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Rachel,  Joey  it would mean so...
Joey, Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me. 
Rachel, Joey...
Phoebe, You okay with this?
Chandler, Well  it makes me feel sad  but...
Phoebe, Talking to Ross.
Chandler, I see.
Ross, Well  Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Monica, I know  but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
Ross, Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back  she would take it?
Monica, How is that gonna happen?
Chandler, Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Ross, I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
Monica, You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
Ross, I didn't say we were brothers.
Monica, Hey Phoebe. Hey  tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it  but Chandler doesn't.
Chandler, We close escrow tomorrow  so seeing another house can only confuse us  and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Monica, But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
Chandler, What do you think Pheebs?
Phoebe, Well  I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey  isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Chandler, Yeah.
Phoebe, She died.
Chandler, You're kidding!
Monica, That's terrible!
Phoebe, Yeah  last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh  wait a minute  I read the wrong one.
Chandler, Oh yeah?
Phoebe, Yeah  she was just an agent.
Monica, Joey's gonna be *so* upset.
Chandler, I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Phoebe, Well  we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Monica, Seriously  you don't think we should tell him?
Phoebe, Well  not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
Monica, What if he reads it in the paper?
Chandler, Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown  I think we're okay.
Ross, Yeah  I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm  actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Ross, Close. Ron. 
Ross, Uhm  well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Ross, Oh  no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Ross, Look  she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
Ross,  Huh  I took a shot there.
Ross, I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
Ross, Oh  nothing  it’s just  it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Ross, How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left  just the two of us  and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist  you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
Ross, You let Rachel come back  and it’s done.
Ross, Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear  your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Ross, He’ll be fine.
Joey, Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe, Hey. Everything ok?
Joey, I’m just mad at my agent.
Phoebe, Estelle? Why?
Joey, There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.
Phoebe, I’m guessing she does.
Joey, Well  I’m wanna hear it  because she keeps doing this.
Phoebe, Well  no  no  wait  wait  wait. All right  I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me  that you will wait a minute before you call her.
Joey, Ok. Why?
Phoebe, Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason. 
Joey, I love that saying!
Joey, Hello?
Joey, I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.
Joey, Yeah  actually I am!
Joey, That’s it? You know  it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
Joey, No  no  look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent  ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.
Joey, I’m saying that… . This isn't working for me anymore  ok? Estelle  you’re fired. Goodbye. .
Phoebe, Man  tough week for Estelle!
Ross, Hi.
Rachel, Hi.
Ross, Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.
Rachel, Oh  well  she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Ross, Ok.
Rachel, Oh  you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called  and gave me my job back!
Ross, Nooo!
Rachel, Yee. I mean  it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean  that place must have been falling apart without me.
Ross, So  you’re not going to Paris.
Rachel, No  I’m still going.
Ross, Wh… wh…what?
Rachel, When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back  the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
Ross, Yeeeah! 
Monica, Hi. We’re buying the house next door  and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
Monica, Thanks.
Chandler, It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat  shouldn’t it be with like a hot  younger house  that does stuff that our house won’t do?
Monica, Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller  the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
Monica, Love it!
Monica, They could be our neighbors  what are they like?
Phoebe, Hey Joey  want come with me to… are you ok?
Joey, Yeah  I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Phoebe, No  that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
Joey, I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard  I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look  I know she’s not a great agent  but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Phoebe, No  no  no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you 
Joey, Why?
Phoebe, Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
Joey,  You blow me away.
Phoebe,  All right  so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
Joey, I promise. And that means  never having to give a reason. 
Chandler, And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Chandler,  Don't  don't! 
Monica, No  actually  we're buying the house next door. 
Chandler,  Why!?
Monica,  I don't know why.
Chandler, This can not be happening!
Monica, Okay  the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler, The only way that that is going to happen  is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Monica,  Okay  Okay   All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Chandler, That is a great idea! And by the way  I don't mean to sound distasteful  but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica, Okay  you come up with an idea.
Chandler, Alright alright  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Monica, But we love our house.
Chandler," Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  ""Oh My God""!"
Monica, Okay  but if we don't get this house  she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean  at least if she's here  it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean  never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body. 
Chandler,  Well  we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh  that does it too. 
Ross,  It's me. Ron.  Look  I um  I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Ross, Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise? 
Ross, Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica.
Ross, Huh? So? We have a deal?
Ross, Yes! yes!
Ross, Oh   Believe me  the ladies  they love it!
Ross, Good  'cause the ladies  not so much. 
Joey, Oh my God.  Hello?
Phoebe,  Joey  it's Estelle. 
Joey, Estelle?
Phoebe, Yeah  I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
Joey,  Ok-ay. I just  I can't believe you're calling me?
Phoebe, Well  I didn't think I should just drop by...
Joey, No  no  no!  Don't drop by  don't drop by!
Phoebe, Anyway  you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Joey, Can I ask you something? Uhm  what's it like there?
Phoebe,  It's alright. Look kiddo  I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
Joey," Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.  ""out of area"". Boy  I'll say."
Chandler, The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Chandler, Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Chandler, Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Chandler, I never stopped loving you.
Chandler, Yeah  yeah  yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Chandler, Now that you live next door  we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Chandler,  Obviously.
Chandler, Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler, I understand.
Chandler,  They're never coming down now.
Rachel, Hi!
Ross, Hey!
Rachel, You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
Ross, What?
Rachel, Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
Ross, They did?
Rachel, Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
Ross, So  what are you gonna do?
Rachel, Well  I took it.
Ross, That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Ross, You're excited  right?
Rachel,  Ye-ah. Yeah! You know  the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
Ross, Right!
Rachel, Yeah  you know  was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know  was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh  absolutely... Oh...! Yeah  but you know  this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can... 
Ross, Uhm  I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm  I mean  you said you were scared.
Rachel, Well yeah  but I mean  it was good scared though  you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm  when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good. 
Ross,  You should go.
Rachel, What?
Ross, It's what you want. You should go.
Rachel, You really think so?
Ross, I really do.
Rachel, But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
Ross,  I'm sure he'll understand.
Rachel, All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
Ross, Yeah...
Rachel, Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you  Ross!
Ross, Yeah  yeah  oh! 
Rachel, Oh! Oh  I'm so happy.
Ross, Then I'm happy too. 
Joey, Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...  ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.  Dude  where's my speech?  That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody. 
Joey, All right  all right  all right  let's play one more time  ok? And remember  if I win you do not move to Paris.
Rachel, Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again  but you're on! All right Joe  you remember the rules! Heads I win  tails you lose.
Joey, Just flip!
Joey, Damnit!
Chandler, Hey!
Joey, Hey!
Chandler, So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Rachel, Oh  that sounds good!
Monica, Hey  Rach  you're leaving tomorrow  shouldn't you be packing?
Rachel, It's all done!
Monica, Oh  yeah  right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God  it hurts to even joke about it.
Rachel, I know... Honey  seriously  I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom  this is Emma's Paris stuff  these are the boxes that I'm having shipped  and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
Monica, Ok  so you've done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?
Rachel, Oh  well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Monica, Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! 
Chandler, Where's your passport?
Rachel, It should be right next to my plane ticket.
Chandler, Well  it's not.
Rachel, What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh  oh  it's not in there! Oh  no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
Monica, Here  let me help you. 
Rachel, Shoot. Oh  I can't believe I did this!
Monica, Oh  wow  can you believe you're like three weeks away?
Monica, You don't mind me touching your belly  do you?
Ross, Hey!
Ross, Hey Erica  welcome back to town!  Wow  look how big you've gotten.
Ross, Right  no  I understand.
Ross, No  no  I knew .
Ross, She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Monica, Yeah  and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.
Ross, Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Monica, Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.
Ross, Erica  those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Monica, Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.
Ross, Oh man  I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
Monica, Oh  I know. I know. Hey  you know  you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.
Ross, No  no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus  how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Monica, Yeah  it takes two incomes.
Ross, Hey  is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Monica, Oh  no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want  you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.
Ross, Mhm   packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Monica, Mhm  helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
Ross, What are you guys doing?
Joey, Try it  I can't feel a thing! 
Chandler, We're taking a break!
Monica, From?
Chandler, Jumping on the bed?
Monica, All right  Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now  Ross  you got Geller blood  you're in charge of these yahoos!
Ross, You got it! . All right  she's right  we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!
Chandler, No  no  no  guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet  Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
Joey, You guys hear a ringing?
Chandler,  What the hell is this?
Joey, Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line  nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
Ross, Chandler  you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.
Chandler, I didn't know Monica had these!
Joey, Mhm  maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
Chandler, Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Ross, Bumming hard  guys  bumming hard.
Phoebe, Hey!
Monica, Hey! Where's Mike?
Phoebe, Oh  he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star  you know. My husband has a gig.
Ross, Yeah? Yeah  where is it?
Phoebe, Oh  he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
Ross, Rock on!
Monica, Well  I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So  enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust  kidney beans in their own juices  and for dessert  a questionable orange.
Joey,  Hey.
Chandler, Hey.
Ross, Hey  where's Rach?
Joey, Oh  she's putting Emma down  she'll be over in a second.
Ross, Great.
Joey, Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off  ok?
Monica, Yeah.
Ross, Here she is!
Joey, What did I just say?
Rachel, No  no  no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Monica, Come here  I'll make you a drink.
Ross, Oh  man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Chandler, I know  she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh  forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Ross, Yeah?
Joey, Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins  tails I lose.  Wait a minute...
Chandler, Yes  Joe?
Joey, I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Rachel, Well  I've been better.
Phoebe, Uh-hmm.
Rachel, You guys are gonna come and visit me  right?
Phoebe, Yes! You know  in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!
Rachel, I'm gonna miss you so much.
Phoebe, I know.
Rachel, You know what? Uhm  I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night  but come here .
Ross, Hey  what do you think they're doing in there?
Joey, Huh  if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
Rachel, Oh  Pheebs  I don't even know where to start.
Phoebe, Ok well  before you do  I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents   but I do have something for you.
Rachel, Oh  oh. . What is this?
Phoebe, It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it  so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there  you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
Rachel, I'm gonna throw this away  but thank you so much for the gesture!
Monica, Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.
Chandler, Oh  yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Monica, What are you talking about? These aren't mine.
Chandler, Oh yeah  right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
Monica, That would be a terrible punishment. But  I'm serious  I've never seen these before.
Chandler, Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Monica, Rachel used to live in that room.
Chandler, Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! 
Monica, Joey's bare ass!
Chandler, . Well played.
Rachel, I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe, I love you too.  Please don't... Don't turn into... you know... French bitch! 
Rachel, All right. Well  if I gonna do this  I'd better keep going.
Phoebe, Ok.
Rachel, Ok. Monica?
Monica, Yeah?
Rachel, Can you come here with me for a minute?
Monica, Sure.
Phoebe,  Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Monica, No.
Phoebe, Oh  you're so screwed. 
Ross,  Hey. What was that all about?
Phoebe, She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Ross, Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Phoebe, Yeah  I know  it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross  get ready to do some serious crying.
Ross, Oh  man  I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Rachel, Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years  would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...
Monica, I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Rachel,  I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
Monica,  You're the best friend I ever had.
Rachel, 
Monica, What?
Rachel, I... I... I... 
Monica, That is so sweet. 
Ross,  Oh no  she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh  so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.
Chandler, Uh  Rach?
Ross, Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.
Joey, I really made you think about that thing uh?
Chandler,  Uh  Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. 
Rachel,  Oh  I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
Chandler, No  no  no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Rachel, Well  these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...
Chandler, Don't say Richard! Well  if they're not Monica's and they're not yours  then whose are they?
Rachel, Well  I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
Chandler, Pheebs!
Phoebe,  Yeah!
Chandler, I think these are yours.
Phoebe, These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are  come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these  they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Rachel,  Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Chandler, Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Phoebe, Where do you think Mike really is? 
Rachel, Oh honey...
Chandler, Let me just say something... Because once we get into this  I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And  I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Rachel,  Oh  you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. 
Chandler, Ooh  not so tight...  I'm sorry  just give me one more chance.
Rachel, Okay. Oh...
Rachel, Oh!
Chandler, I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't  I can't.
Monica,  So  I guess you're next. You're ready?
Ross, I don't think so.
Chandler, Oh  you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Monica, You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.
Chandler, That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Ross, God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?
Phoebe, I don't know. But  God  Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
Ross, Okay  here we go...
Rachel, Oh...  Well...
Ross, Yeah...
Rachel, I think I'm gonna take off. 
Ross, Huh?
Rachel, Oh  you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
Ross, What? I don't get a goodbye?
Joey,  Lucky bastard!
Ross, Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.
Monica, Well  maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be  you know  implicit.
Ross, Well  it needs to be plicit.
Joey, All right  let's think about this. I mean  there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Ross, No  I don't think so.
Phoebe, You know  maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
Monica, Yeah. Mine too.
Chandler, Mine was a humdinger
Ross,  O-kay... I mean  don't I deserve anything? I mean  a few tears  a cursory hug?  NOT FROM YOU! 
Phoebe, Ross  if you're this upset  you should go and talk to her.
Monica," And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye""  I mean  he's got more pride than that."
Ross, THE HELL I DO!
Ross, I don't get a goodbye?
Rachel, What?
Ross,  Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye  huh? Be best friends with you? Uh  go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute  wait a minute  I did all those things.
Rachel, Ross...
Ross, Oh no  maybe it's me  I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh  I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh  goodbye  goodbye  goodbye  goodbye  good...  IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through  I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a  have a good time in Paris. 
Monica, I hope Ross isn't too upset.
Joey, I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Phoebe, Tell me about it.
Chandler, Well  you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
Phoebe, All right  I think I'm gonna head out.
Monica, Uh  where do you think you're going?
Phoebe, I thought I was going home to go to bed  but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Monica, We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.
Chandler, Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Joey, Oh  yeah  yeah  good idea. 
Monica, Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
Chandler,  You couldn't be cool. 
Monica, Okay  we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Monica, Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember  if I am harsh with you  it is only because you are doing it wrong.
Chandler, Hey Mon  I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Monica, You did? How?
Chandler, Well  I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Monica, Oh my God! Let me see. 
Joey, Who's that dirty old lady?
Chandler, Monica's grandmother.
Monica, Nana liked it rough!
Joey, Come on here  have a seat.
Phoebe, How was your night?
Monica, Erica  are you okay?
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler, Relax! We just get her some antacids.
Monica, She doesn't have a stomach ache  she's in labor.
Chandler, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Yeah  you got to get to the hospital.
Monica, All right  Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey  keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD  WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God  oh God  I got to sit down  I got to sit down. Ooh! 
Chandler, Honey  it's gonna be okay.
Monica, Okay  okay... Okay  I feel a little better.
Monica, Oh... Yes  I'm sure. Oh honey  let's go. Okay bye everyone.
Joey, Chandler  wait  wait  wait...
Chandler, What?
Joey, If you get a second  find out where she got that cheeseburger.
Rachel, You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross, That's what it seemed like.
Rachel, I cannot believe that after ten years  you do not know ONE thing about me.
Ross, Fine  then why didn't you say something?
Rachel, Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day  it makes me not want to go... Okay  so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else  you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there  all right  there's your goodbye... Oh!
Ross, Rach!
Rachel, What?
Ross, You keep  you keep... You can't...
Rachel, WHAT?
Joey, A little more.
Phoebe, Okay. 
Joey, A little more  a little more.  A little more... All right. Okay  all right  let's do this.
Phoebe, All right  ready?
Joey, Yeah. All right  now give me your best shot.
Phoebe, All right  here it goes...
Joey,  Doesn't work... 
Monica, Erica  are you okay?
Monica, Oh my God!
Chandler, Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Monica, She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Chandler, Oh my God!
Rachel, So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else  you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Ross, Rach!
Rachel, What?!
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Ross, Oh. This was amazing.
Rachel, It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Ross," Yeah  well  this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a joke."
Rachel, Ah.
Ross, Who's laughing now?
Rachel, I know!
Monica, Breathe  breathe  breathe... Good.
Chandler, Next time  can I say breathe?
Monica, No  last time you said it like Dracula  and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
Monica, Alright  I'll be right back.
Chandler, Where are you going?
Monica, To use the bathroom.
Chandler, You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica, What?
Chandler, This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Monica, What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Chandler, It's just that we've never spent any time  you know  alone together.
Monica, You'll be fine. Nah  you won't  but I'll be back in two minutes.
Chandler, Okay.
Chandler, So  ah... Any plans for the summer?
Chandler, Hah. May not wanna mention this. So  you ever wonder which is worse  you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Chandler, Well  it's just interesting. You know  because no one will ever know  because no one can experience both.
Chandler, One of life's great  unanswerable questions. I mean  who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Phoebe, Morning.
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, What's that?
Joey, It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
Phoebe, It's a baby chick and duck!
Joey, Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Phoebe, I did not see that coming.
Joey, Yeah  I figure they'll love it at the new house  you know? It has that big backyard. And then  when they get old  they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Phoebe, Yes.
Joey, Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Phoebe, That is the rule  though.
Phoebe, Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
Ross, What?
Joey, Yeah  Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
Ross, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Yeah  and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Ross, Phoebe  you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, Have you seen him throw a ball?
Ross, Is Rachel here?
Joey, Uh  I think she's still asleep. Hey  hey  how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
Ross, Uh  we  y'know  we worked things out.
Phoebe, What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Ross, Hey  I'm not one to kiss and tell  but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Joey, Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Ross, I know  it's pretty great.
Joey, So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
Ross, Oh  I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
Phoebe, But do you wanna get back together?
Ross, I don't know. It was incredible. I mean  it just felt so right. When I was holding her  I mean  I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah  I do. I wanna be together.
Phoebe,  YAY!
Ross, Shhh!
Phoebe,  Yay!
Joey, So  so is she still going to Paris?
Ross, Wow  I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Phoebe," Oh  this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together  Monica and Chandler are getting their baby  there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh  I feel like I'm in a musical!  ""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up  bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."""
Rachel, Morning!
Phoebe, Guess we'll never know how it ends.
Joey, Okay.
Ross, Hey.
Rachel, Hey.
Ross, Hey. How did you sleep?
Rachel, Good. You?
Ross, Good.
Joey, I bet you did!
Ross, Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Joey, Sure  yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Rachel, Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Phoebe,  Dive. Yeah  they dove head-first into fun on the farm.
Ross, So...
Ross, Morning.
Rachel, You too. Last night was just wonderful.
Ross, It really was.
Rachel, I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Ross, I know  me too. It was... You know  it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen  and then it does  and it's everything you want it to be.
Rachel, Uh-huh. I know. It was just  it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. 
Monica, It's just a little bit more  honey.
Chandler, Is it really that bad?
Monica, Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler  you have to see this!
Chandler, I'm okay.
Monica, Chandler  you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!
Chandler, Alright. Wow  that is one disgusting miracle.
Monica, It's a... It's a boy!
Chandler, Wow!
Monica, Oh  you did it!
Chandler,  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Chandler, Well  that's spongy.
Monica,  Oh  hey handsome! Oh  I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh  we are so lucky!
Chandler, I know. He has your eyes.
Chandler, I mean  I know that's not possible  but he does.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica,  Oh my God  he's beautiful. Thank you so much.
Chandler, How do you feel?
Monica, I... I'm sorry  who should be along in a what now?
Monica, We only ordered one!
Chandler, Oh  yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
Chandler, Well  gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Monica,  Wait  did you know it was twins?
Monica,  Anybody tell you?
Monica, This is unbelievable.
Chandler, Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?
Chandler, What do we do?
Monica," What do you mean ""what do we do""?"
Chandler,  Twins! Twins!!
Monica, Chandler  you're panicking!
Chandler, Uh-huh! Join me  won't you?! Okay  what do you say we keep one  and then just like have an option on the other one?
Monica, We can't split them up!
Chandler, Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion  and then years later  they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean  that's a great day for everybody.
Monica, Okay  what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Chandler, What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Monica, Yeah  because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Chandler, Monica  we are not ready to have two babies!
Monica," That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of ""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there! We are taking them home  because they are our children!"
Chandler,  Okay. Shhh...
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Okay!
Chandler, Okay!
Chandler,  She? It's a girl?
Chandler,  Well  now we have one of each!  And that's enough!
Ross, And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Joey, Oh my God! What did you say?
Ross, Nothing! What do you say to that?
Phoebe, Ross  you've got to tell her how you feel!
Ross, No way!
Joey, You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Ross, What?
Joey, Dude  I'm just trying to speak your language.
Phoebe, Ross  Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did  she might feel differently. She might not even go.
Ross, You really think so?
Phoebe," I'm telling you! Oh  okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  ""Bam-bam  don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam  don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."""
Rachel, Hi!
Phoebe, Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Joey, Hey!
Rachel, Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
Ross, Okay.
Joey, Oh  you're not taking her with you tonight?
Rachel, No  we decided that I would go ahead and set up first  and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Phoebe, Wow  eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck  mom.
Rachel, Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck  Emma!
Ross, Alright  you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Joey, Ross  wait!
Ross, What? What?
Joey, Could you get me a muffin?
Rachel, Yeah?
Rachel,  Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way  but I do. And  and when I'm in a café  having coffee  or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun  I'll think of you. Aw.
Rachel, Oh... Bye guys.
Ross, Oh my God!
Phoebe, Unbelievable!
Joey, Hey  you know what might help?
Ross, I'm not getting you a muffin!
Monica, Do you think they recognize each other from in there?
Chandler, Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years  and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Monica, There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
Monica, Son of a gun  it is!
Monica, Okay  well  bye!
Chandler, Bye!
Monica, We'll call you!
Chandler, Have fun at church-camp!
Monica, Oh  look at these little bunnies!
Chandler, I know! You ready to trade?
Monica, Okay.
Chandler, Okay.
Monica, Alright  let's see..
Chandler, We could trade later.
Monica, Yeah  I'm good.
Phoebe, Hey  what are you working on?
Joey," It's a... It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby."
Phoebe, How sweet! Oh  is that the baby?
Joey, No  I sat in the paint.
Ross, Hey.
Phoebe, Hey. So  did you talk to Rachel?
Ross, No  and I'm not going to.
Phoebe, What?
Joey, Why not?
Ross, Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Phoebe, How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean  sure  he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her  you slept together last night.
Ross, Yeah  and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Joey, Yeah  I know what you mean. I mean  sometimes...
Phoebe, Uh  Joe?
Joey, Damn it!
Ross, Look  even if I were gonna tell her  I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Phoebe, No  you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
Phoebe, Hey! What do you have there?
Ross, Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Phoebe, Honey  that's gorgeous!
Joey, You know  the baby can't read  Mike!
Rachel, Hi! You guys  the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Joey, Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently  there's some big surprise.
Phoebe, Yeah  did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny  tiny beard.
Rachel, Oh my God!
Ross, Oh my God!
Rachel, Hi! Oh my gosh!
Chandler, Hey.
Joey,  Hey  so what is the big surprise?
Rachel, Oh.
Ross, Oh my God!
Rachel, What... What...
Ross, Okay  okay  awkward question. The hospital knows you took two  right?
Monica, Yes  it's twins!
Ross, Oh my God.
Joey, Oh  they're so cute! Now  what  what kinds are they?
Monica,  This is a boy   and that's a girl.
Chandler, Her name is Erica.
Rachel, Aw..
Joey, Hey  that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Chandler, Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Monica, Yeah  we named the boy Jack after dad.
Ross, Aw  he's gonna be so happy.
Phoebe," Oh  Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh  it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy  you know? ""Jack Bing  Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"""
Rachel, Oh my gosh. Wow  so beautiful.
Phoebe, Oh yeah? Well  tell me which one  and I'll try slip it in my coat.
Phoebe, One? How about a whole bunch?
Phoebe, Yeah! Ooh  we could teach them to sing  and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.
Rachel, Oh  you guys  I can't believe this. But I'll leave now  or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Monica, I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
Rachel, Me too. Oh  I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright  I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
Monica, I love you.
Chandler, I love you.
Monica, Call us when you get there.
Rachel, I will. Ross  come here.
Rachel, I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Ross, Neither will I.
Rachel, Alright  now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh  they're gonna really hate me over there.
Phoebe, So  you just let her go?
Ross, Yeah.
Joey, Hey  maybe that's for the best.
Ross, Yeah?
Joey, Yeah. You know? You just... Look  you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does  okay? Maybe  maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Phoebe, But now she'll never know how he feels!
Joey, Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe  maybe it is better this way? I mean  now  now you can move on. I mean  you've been trying to for so long  maybe now that you're on different continents..  Right?
Joey, Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Ross, Yeah  that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
Joey, What?
Ross, I don't! I wanna be with her.
Joey, Really?
Ross, Yeah  I'm gonna go after her.
Joey, Yeah  you are!
Phoebe, Woo!
Phoebe, Wait  wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
Ross, My coat...
Joey, This is so cool!
Chandler, I have no idea what's going on  but I am excited!
Joey, But Ross  Ross. What do you  what do you think she's going to say?
Ross, I don't know  but I.. Look  even if she shoots me down  at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Phoebe, You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs  I'll drive you to the airport.
Ross, Okay  guys  wish me luck.
Phoebe, Hurry!
Joey, Good luck  good luck!
Ross, There's no seatbelt!
Phoebe, That's okay. If - if we hit anything  the engine will explode  so you know  it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Ross, Alright  alright  let's do this!
Phoebe, Okay!
Ross, Hey!
Phoebe, I - I don't take passengers.
Ross, No  you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.
Phoebe," My medallion number is  ""Get out of the cab!"""
Ross,  Get out of the cab!
Phoebe, Get out of the cab!
Joey, Oh  hey  hey  can I give you guys your house-warming present now?
Monica, Now  that you can do.
Joey, Alright!
Joey, Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
Phoebe, You can open your eyes now.
Ross, Are we off the bridge?
Phoebe, Yes.
Ross, Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Phoebe, Yes  she jumped right back up.
Ross, Oh my God  Phoebe  slow down!
Phoebe, Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
Ross, Yes  but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Phoebe, You should have thought of that before you got in!
Phoebe, Toll-booth.
Ross, What?
Phoebe,  Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Phoebe, Hurry!
Ross, Okay!
Phoebe, Okay.
Phoebe, Damn  that window is clean.
Joey, Quack  quack  tweet  tweet  quack  quack  tweet  tweet  quack  quack  tweet  tweet  quack  quack  tweet  tweet  quack  tweet  quack...
Chandler, We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift  but now we understand you were doing this.
Joey, Okay  I wanted to surprise you  but for your house-warming gift  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
Chandler, Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Monica, Oh  great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Joey, Yeah  yeah  they must have jumped off the table  'cause now they're gone!
Chandler, Oh  don't worry  we'll find them.
Monica, Actually  I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Chandler, Alright.
Monica, Oh God! What did I just step on?
Joey, Oh!
Chandler, It's okay  it's just an egg roll.
Monica, Oh..
Joey, You stepped on my egg roll?
Monica, I'm sorry  I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Joey, Just put it on a plate and leave.
Chandler, Okay  let's find these birds.
Joey, Alright.
Joey, Wait  wait. Do you hear that?
Joey, Oh! They're in the table!
Chandler, Well  that can't be good!
Joey, We gotta get them out of there!
Chandler, How?
Joey, Oh  oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Chandler, Oh  tons  I'm quite the woodsman.
Joey, Well  maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Chandler, Joey  wait! The ball!
Joey, Oh!
Joey, Oh God! So what do we do?
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Joey, Okay.
Chandler, No... It's all glued together.
Joey, Does that mean we have to bust it open?
Chandler, I don't know. Maybe.
Joey, Oh my God!
Chandler, I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Joey," All right  you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. ""Those are our men in there  we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."""
Chandler, Did that movie ever get made?
Joey, It did not.
Phoebe, Ross  where are you going?
Ross, To talk to Rachel  isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Phoebe, What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Ross, Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Phoebe, You have to get a ticket to get past security.
Ross, What? We're never gonna make it!
Phoebe, Not with that attitude! Now  haul ass!
Ross, Okay  if you could all walk slower  that'd be great.
Rachel, Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French  but I understood every word you just said!
Rachel, Oh.
Rachel, Oh  shoot. I had it. Oh  I can't believe this.
Rachel, I have it  I have it  I have it. Oh  okay  I can't find it  but I remember that I was in seat 32C  because that's my bra-size.
Rachel, Okay  fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D  we would not be having this problem.
Ross, Hey  I need a ticket.
Phoebe, Just one? I drive you all the way down here  and I don't get to see how it works out?
Ross, Fine  two tickets  I need two tickets.
Phoebe, We're on our honeymoon.
Ross, I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
Phoebe, I'm so lucky I married you.
Rachel, Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
Rachel, Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! You're a different person.
Ross, Okay  flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it  do you see it?
Phoebe, No  did we miss it?
Ross, No  no  no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Phoebe, Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Monica, Hello.
Phoebe, Hey  it's me. Here's Ross.
Ross, What? Hey  hey  listen..
Monica, Oh my God! Ross  you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
Ross, Monica? Monica  Monica  Monica  Monica..?
Monica, Oh  I'm sorry. Shoot  they were doing it before.
Ross, That's alright. Listen  listen.
Monica, Oh  wait  wait  wait! Here they go again.
Ross, Monica? Monica  Monica  Monica  Monica..?
Monica, Isn't that cute?
Ross, That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
Monica, Oh  okay. Alright  it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Ross, Yes  that's what I have. It's not on the board.
Monica, That's what it says here. Flight 421  leaves at 8:40  Newark airport.
Ross, What?
Monica, Newark airport. Why  where are you?
Ross, JFK.
Joey,  Don't worry  you guys  we're gonna get you out of there.
Chandler, And we're also gonna buy you tiny  bird hearing-aids.
Joey, Okay. Here goes.
Chandler, What's the matter?
Joey, I need to say goodbye to the table first.
Chandler, I understand.
Joey, Okay. Table  you have given us so many great times. And you guys  Jordan  Victor  Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?
Chandler, I don't know. Except that  for one last time...  Good game  good game  good game  good game  good game  good game  good game.
Joey, Okay  here we go. I can't do it.
Chandler, Well  I can't do it either.
Monica, Hey! Did you find them?
Joey, Yeah  they're stuck inside the table!
Chandler, We have to bust it open  but neither of us can do it!
Monica, Oh  well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Ross, Phoebe! Wow! No  no  no!
Phoebe, Well  I've never gone this fast before.
Ross, Phoebe  forget it  okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
Phoebe, She's got her cell  you could call her.
Ross, I am not doing this over the phone.
Phoebe, You don't have any other choice!
Rachel, Hello?
Phoebe, Rachel? Oh  good. Hey  by the way  did you just get on the plane?
Rachel, Yeah.
Phoebe,  For what it's worth  we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Ross, Yay.
Phoebe, Uh  Rach  hang on.
Rachel, Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Phoebe, Uhm  actually no. No  you've... You have to get off the plane.
Rachel, What? Why?
Phoebe, I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel, Oh  honey  I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Rachel, Alright  look  I have to go. I love you  and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
Rachel, Oh  that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane  because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
Rachel, I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this  and you know what? She's almost never right.
Rachel, Well...
Rachel, Wait  what are you doing?
Rachel, Could I get some peanuts?
Rachel, This is ridiculous! I...
Rachel, Yeah  okay.
Monica, Alright. My job here is done.
Chandler, That was... Impressive.
Joey, Yeah  you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
Monica, Yeah  they were just slowing me down. Alright  I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.
Chandler, Sorry about the table  man.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, You gonna buy a new one?
Joey, Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Chandler, Well  at least we got these little guys out.
Joey, Yeah.
Chandler, Aww  we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand  huh?
Joey, I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Chandler, Hey  you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Joey, What?
Chandler, Yeah  I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And  plus  here they'd have their own room.
Joey, I could get a goose!
Chandler, You know  I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Joey, Thanks man. Did you hear that  you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And  and it's good  you know  'cause  'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Chandler, I think there may be another reason. So  awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Joey, Uh  lame cool guy handshake  yeah.
Ross, Where is she?
Phoebe, I don't see her.
Ross, Rachel! Rachel Green!
Phoebe, There she is!
Ross, Rachel! Rachel!
Ross, No  no  I just have to talk to someone.
Ross, No  no  no  but...
Phoebe,  RACHEL!!
Rachel, Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
Phoebe, Okay  you're on.
Rachel, What? What? Ross  you're scaring me. What's going on?
Ross, Okay  the thing is..
Rachel, Yeah?
Ross, Don't go.
Rachel, What?
Ross, Please  please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please  don't go.
Rachel, Oh my God.
Ross, I know  I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it  but I'm.. That was stupid  okay? I'm sorry  but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Ross, Hey  hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Rachel, I - I have to get on the plane.
Ross, No  you don't.
Rachel, Yes  I do.
Ross, No  you don't.
Rachel, They're waiting for me  Ross. I can't do this right now  I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Ross, Rachel?
Rachel, I'm so sorry.
Ross, I really thought she'd stay.
Phoebe, I'm sorry.
Monica, Well  that's it. Everything's packed.
Chandler, Wow  this is weird.
Monica, I know.
Joey, Yeah. Uh  does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Monica, I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
Joey, I love you!
Joey, Hey!
Phoebe, Hey.
Joey, So did you guys make it in time?
Phoebe, Yeah  yeah  he talked to her  but she got on the plane anyway.
Chandler, Where's Ross?
Phoebe, He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Rachel,  Ross  hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you  and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said  and I didn't. I mean  I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh  I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.
Ross, Oh my God!
Rachel,  Excuse me?
Rachel,  I'm sorry. I'm really sorry  but I need to get off the plane  okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
Ross, Let her off the plane!
Rachel,  Oh  please  miss  you don't understand!
Ross, Try to understand!
Rachel,  Oh  come on  miss  isn't there any way that you can just let me off...
Ross, No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Rachel, I got off the plane.
Ross, You got off the plane.
Rachel, I do love you.
Ross, I love you too  and I'm never letting you go again.
Rachel, Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be  okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.
Ross, Me neither  okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Rachel, Okay. You and me  alright? This is it.
Ross, This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Ross, Don't make jokes now.
Monica, Okay  please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Monica, If that falls off the truck  it wouldn't be the worst thing.
Ross, Wow.
Rachel, I know. It seems smaller somehow.
Joey, Has it always been purple?
Chandler,  Look around  you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place  filled with love and laughter. But more important  because of rent control  it was a friggin' steal!
Phoebe, Hey  do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
Monica, Oh  yeah  that's true.
Ross, Uh  I haven't.
Monica, Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma  and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Ross, Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Monica, Oh  honey  I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Chandler, Oh  okay.
Phoebe, So  I guess this is it.
Joey, Yeah. I guess so.
Monica,  This is harder than I thought it would be.
Chandler, Oh  it's gonna be okay.
Rachel,  Do you guys have to go to the new house right away  or do you have some time?
Monica, We got some time.
Rachel, Okay  should we get some coffee?
Chandler, Sure. Where?
