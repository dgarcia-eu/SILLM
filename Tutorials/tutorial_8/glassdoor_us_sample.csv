The scale and reach of the company was impressive. If you want to scale a product to sell anywhere in the world, then this is the company to do it. The sales team is the best out of anywhere I've worked. Everybody I've met was top-notch. Even though our product flat-out didn't work, the sales rep would still be able to sell it. Some of the managers were great too - even though turnover was high. Good company to learn about global business and how to compete. Very competitive culture.. You're one of 130,000 people. It's like working in Congress. Everybody is smart, has their own mandate and agenda, but has to make it look like whatever they're doing is the most important thing in the world. In our work group, we had a stacked-ranking performance management system where every year, all your teammates are stacked ranked and the lowest performer gets fired. This led to team meetings with people yelling at each other. ""I did most of the work on this project, you didn't do sh*t!"" Or ""This is what I do, that is what you do, stay out of my way."" Larry Ellison has a saying. ""It is not sufficient that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."" Whenever Salesforce missed their quarterly earnings or had a service outage, people would pop champagne and send congratulatory emails to each other - piling on and gloating. Nothing really gets done because of all the approvals that have to take place and anybody can veto your project.

Microsoft really has changed its vision in the past couple of years to reverse course to focus on empowering all people and organizations with its technology. The benefits are fantastic and there psd tons of flexibility to work from home or wherever you are most comfortable/productive. There are a lot of smart people and the company is on the forefront of tons of cool technology. As a full time employee you can access a lot of information and learn tons about what other groups are building. Communication style is very top down with major reorg announcements being forwarded on from top leadership without any clarity on how this impacts your role in the future. There were reorgs every 6 months while I was there so you just get used to it. There isn't really a ""management culture"" here unlike other big/mature companies I've worked at. Some managers are promoted for being a good IC which means managing up and not being interested in coaching. It's very subjective what makes a top performer and varies by group. They're changing the review process but its still opaque. Big company with lots of politics. Sometimes it feels like you're working in the government and not in the fast paced tech sector. Different groups will start similar projects, then senior managers lobby for each one and there's very little assurance that anything you create or run will continue into the next fiscal year (especially if there's a reorg). This can be very demotivating for someone with pilot programs as you never get to iterate on ideas.",,0.9274,0.9015,0.5927,0.9907,-0.9998,0.0,microsoft,3600_microsoft,WA,reports,Information Technology,Systems Software,"Redmond, Washington",01/06/1994,789019.0,1975,West,Pacific

Where people worked long hours, had no work/life balance, were micromanaged and constantly felt that their manager or executive team was out to get them. Crown Castle is the COMPLETE opposite of it. The executive management team at Crown CARES about what is going on at the individual level. One example of this and how they take time out every 3 months to take questions from the employees (ranging from technical questions to benefits to even asking for school debt repayment) and address them as fast as they can. Trust me, Crown is not how some of these comments describe it to be. The company has grown a lot and of course there are some growing pains that come along. The company is on track to only improve and get better. I believe that some of these negative comments are stemming from people who don't adapt to change well and instantly blame the entire company for their frustration when perhaps it could be resolved by discussing with their manager /director etc. or by taking a step of action to resolve the issue at hand. Crown is amazing. Our CEO is so down to earth and truly cares about IC.

I came from a company that was truly toxic, where the management team were bullies and did not care about their employees. Where people worked long hours, had no work/life balance, were micromanaged and constantly felt that their manager or executive team was out to get them. Crown Castle is the COMPLETE opposite of it. The executive management team at Crown CARES about what is going on at the individual level. One example of this and how they take time out every 3 months to take questions from the employees (ranging from technical questions to benefits to even asking for school debt repayment) and address them as fast as they can. Trust me, Crown is not how some of these comments describe it to be. The company has grown a lot and of course there are some growing pains that come along. The company is on track to only improve and get better.

During the ""proxy season,"" which takes place between January and May, temporary workers will be hired to assist the full-time staff with their responsibilities. Despite this, work is overflowing during this time due to a lack of foresight by those responsible for hiring. During your interview you will be hired based solely on your ability to proofread documents, there isn't even a test of any sort. If your resume has an English or writing degree on it then they will most likely accept you immediately. Getting a job at Broadridge is not the difficult part, it is keeping the desire to want the job that is. Like many places, Broadridge management has a problem when it comes to separating personal with professional. As a contracted, temporary worker you will bear witness to loud chatter, inappropriate sexual relationships and disruptive practices that bring the personal lives of each co-worker and manager to the professional setting. You will later witness management act on these established bonds with the workers under them, giving special treatment to those they tend to get along with out of office hours. Blame is often placed on the most vulnerable workers in the department, in this case it was the temporary, contracted workers. Effort is not made to improve productivity, mistakes are bottled up for weeks at a time and dispensed all at once during group meetings where accountability falls on a team (such as ""the temps"") and not on any one person. This creates an environment where those that purposely do not do their work are on the same level with those that put in a level of extra effort to make up for that decline. Workers are unable to improve their own methods and practices because criticism is rarely constructive. Other complaints: As many as 7 Temporary workers are stuffed into a small, non-ventilated room where heat quickly builds up due to the use of computers. To remedy this, a small fan may be given to the workers to share among themselves. As a worker you will receive conflicting instructions from managers in different areas. This can lead to confusion and a lack in productivity. Creation of documents to be proofread are often constructed first by workers who cannot speak fluent English (some from India and some on-site), which lowers productivity for the entire department.",,Wed Aug 10 2016 12:16:33 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time),"Proofreader in Edgewood, NY",,,"Edgewood, NY",606.0,On-site cafeteria and medical wing.,,,,,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,Treats Temp Workers as Fodder,,"Treats Temp Workers as Fodder.

So if you have some skills go elsewhere. - Benefits are weak, just like the salary. - If you are a tech person or if you have coding skills this place is not for you. Majority of resources have Liberal Arts Degree and have nothing to do with tech. They are the reason why center is capable of keeping compensation to its employees so low. I have an App Developer in my team who has no dev skills and has a History Major and you will be expected to help him to do his job. Expect your work-life balance to struggle. - Favorite topic of 80% of people in the center is :""I can't wait to get out."" which is sad, because it is IBM. - People don't stay too long, especially if it is a skilled individual. - You will be running around the center in search of the project. And yes, you have to find your own projects and this is not easy. It is like you have a job and your job is to find a job. Not easy because of the damaged reputation of the center among other IBM practices. -Traveling is expected to be 50% , in reality you will travel 100% and it is exhausting. - Ethics of the upper management is a very questionable subject. - Managers are not aware who they hired and what skills their people have, which is sad.",,0.3612,-0.8607,-0.5256,-0.6605,-1.0,0.0,ibm,2388_ibm,LA,,,,,,,,South,West South Central
